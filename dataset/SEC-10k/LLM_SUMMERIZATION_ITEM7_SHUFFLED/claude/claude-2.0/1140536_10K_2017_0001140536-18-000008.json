MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nThis discussion includes forward-looking statements. See \u2018Disclaimer Regarding Forward-looking Statements' for certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and \u2018Risk Factors' in Item 1A for a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in those statements.\nThis discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u2018SEC'). We present such non-GAAP financial measures, specifically, adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Company's operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent under U.S. GAAP, and these provide a measure against which our businesses may be assessed in the future.\nOur methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. These financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSee \u2018Non-GAAP Financial Measures' below for further discussion of our adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures.\nExecutive Overview\nBusiness Overview\nWillis Towers Watson is a global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth. With roots dating to 1828, Willis Towers Watson has more than 43,000 employees and services clients in more than 140 countries and territories. We design and deliver solutions that manage risk, optimize benefits, cultivate talent, and expand the power of capital to protect and strengthen institutions and individuals. We believe our unique perspective allows us to see the critical intersections between talent, assets and ideas - the dynamic formula that drives business performance.\nWe offer clients a broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks, and to enhance business performance by improving their ability to attract, retain and engage a talented workforce. Our risk control services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial analysis), to a variety of due diligence services, to the provision of practical on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss control consulting), as well as analytical and advisory services (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies). We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they occur. These services include contingency planning, security audits and product tampering plans. We help our clients enhance their business performance by delivering consulting services, technology and solutions that help organizations anticipate, identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities in human capital management as well as investment advice to help our clients develop disciplined and efficient strategies to meet their investment goals.\nAs an insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best means of managing risk and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network. We operate the largest private Medicare exchange in the U.S. Through this exchange and those for active employees, we help our clients move to a more sustainable economic model by capping and controlling the costs associated with healthcare benefits.\nWe are not an insurance company, and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from either commissions or fees for broking or consulting services. No single client represented a significant concentration of our consolidated revenues for any of the periods presented.\nOur shares are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\nMarket Conditions\nDue to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, commission revenues may vary widely between accounting periods. A period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a \u2018soft' or \u2018softening' market, generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. A \u2018hard' or \u2018firming' market, during which premium rates rise, generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. Rates, however, vary by geography,\nindustry and client segment. As a result, and due to the global and diverse nature of our business, we view rates in the aggregate.\nMarket conditions in our broking industry are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world, insurance rate movements, and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients.\nManagement has considered the U.K. referendum vote on June 23, 2016 to depart from the E.U., the triggering of Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon (providing the right to and procedures for a member to leave the E.U.) on March 29, 2017, the early general election held on June 8, 2017, and the uncertainties about the near-term and longer-term effects of Brexit on the Company. The terms of Brexit, and its impact, are highly uncertain. For a further discussion of the risks of Brexit to the Company, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTypically, our business benefits from regulatory change, political risk or economic uncertainty. Insurance broking generally tracks the economy, but demand for both insurance broking and consulting services usually remains steady during times of uncertainty. We have some businesses, such as our health and benefits and administration businesses, which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change.\nAlthough approximately 22% of our revenues are generated in the U.K. on an annual basis, only about 13% of revenues are denominated in Pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in U.S. dollars. Approximately 19% of our expenses are denominated in Pounds sterling, thus we generally benefit from a weakening Pound sterling in our income from operations. However, we have a Company hedging strategy for this aspect of our business, which is designed to mitigate significant fluctuations in currency.\nThe markets for our consulting, technology and solutions, and marketplace services are subject to changes as a result of economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, and increased competition from established and new competitors. We believe the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation, the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment, global scale, quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients' unique needs. With regard to the market for exchanges, we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients, a strong reputation for efficient execution and an innovative service delivery model and platform. Part of the employer sponsored insurance market has matured and become more fragmented while other segments remain in the entry phase. As these market segments continue to evolve, we may experience growth in intervals, with periods of accelerated expansion balanced by periods of modest growth.\nSee Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussions of risks that may affect our ability to compete.\nBusiness Strategy\nWillis Towers Watson sees that a unified approach to people and risk can be a path to growth for our clients. Our integrated teams bring together our understanding of risk strategies and market analytics. This helps clients around the world to achieve their objectives.\nWe operate in attractive markets - both growing and mature - with a diversified platform across geographies, industries, segments and lines of business. We aim to create and become the premier advisory, broking and solutions company of choice globally. We design and deliver solutions that manage risk, optimize benefits, cultivate talent, and expand the power of capital to protect and strengthen institutions and individuals. We also help organizations improve performance through effective people, risk and financial management by focusing on providing human capital and financial consulting services.\nWe believe we can achieve this by:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Delivering a powerful client proposition with an integrated global platform.

This means commitment to shared values, a framework that guides how we run our business and serve clients.\nThrough these strategies we aim to accelerate revenue, cash flow, EBITDA and earnings growth, and generate compelling returns for investors by delivering tangible growth in revenues and capitalizing on the identified cost synergies.\nMerger with Towers Watson\nOn January 4, 2016, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated June 29, 2015, as amended on November 19, 2015, between Willis, Towers Watson, and Citadel Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willis formed for the purpose of facilitating this transaction (\u2018Merger Sub'), Merger Sub merged with and into Towers Watson, with Towers Watson continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willis.\nAt the effective time of the Merger (the \u2018Effective Time'), each issued and outstanding share of Towers Watson common stock (the \u2018Towers Watson shares'), was converted into the right to receive 2.6490 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable ordinary shares of Willis (the \u2018Willis ordinary shares'), $0.000115 nominal value per share, other than any Towers Watson shares owned by Towers Watson, Willis or Merger Sub at the Effective Time and the Towers Watson shares held by stockholders who are entitled to, and who properly exercised, dissenter's rights under Delaware law.\nImmediately following the Merger, Willis effected (i) a consolidation (i.e., a reverse stock split under Irish law) of Willis ordinary shares whereby every 2.6490 Willis ordinary shares were consolidated into one Willis ordinary share ($0.000304635 nominal value per share) and (ii) an amendment to its constitution and other organizational documents to change its name from Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company to Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company.\nWe are continuing our integration of Legacy Willis and Legacy Towers Watson, creating a unified platform for global growth, including positioning the Company to leverage our mutual distribution strength to enhance market penetration, expand our global footprint and create a strong platform for further innovation.\nAs Reported Consolidated Financial Information\nThe table below sets forth our summarized consolidated statements of comprehensive income and data as a percentage of

Brokerage commissions and fees negotiated in lieu of commissions are recognized at the later of the policy inception date or when the policy placement is complete or as the fees are otherwise determined. Commissions on additional premiums and adjustments are recognized when approved by or agreed between the parties and collectability is reasonably assured. Consulting revenue is generally recognized as services are performed. No single client represented a significant concentration of our consolidated revenues for any of our three most recent fiscal years.\nThe following table details our top five markets based on percentage of consolidated revenues (in U.S. dollars) from the countries where work is performed for the year ended December 31, 2017.

This growth in revenues was driven by strong performances in all segments.\nOur revenues can be materially impacted by changes in currency conversions, which can fluctuate significantly over the course of a calendar year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, currency translation decreased our consolidated revenues by $27 million. The decrease was driven primarily by a weaker Pound sterling during the first half of the year, partially offset by increases in the Pound sterling, Euro, the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar in the second half of the year.\nThe impact of acquisitions and divestitures did not have a significant impact on the change in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 since most of these transactions happened in the latter part of the year. Prospectively, our 2018 revenues will exclude a net $65 million related to the impact of various acquisitions and divestitures initiated or completed in 2017.\nThe following table sets out the total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the components of the change in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year:\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Components of Change (i)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Reported Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Currency Impact\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant Currency Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisitions/Divestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Organic Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\n(i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $7.9 billion, compared to $3.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $4.1 billion, or 106%. This growth in revenues was driven by our merger with Towers Watson and our acquisition of Gras Savoye.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the foreign currency impact resulted from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against a number of currencies, most significantly the Euro and the Pound sterling.\nDefinitions of Constant Currency Change and Organic Change are included in the section entitled \u2018Non-GAAP Financial Measures' elsewhere within this Form 10-K.\nAs Reported Segment Revenues\nIn 2016, we began managing our business across four integrated reportable operating segments: Human Capital and Benefits; Corporate Risk and Broking; Investment, Risk and Reinsurance; and Benefits Delivery and Administration, formerly Exchange Solutions.\nBeginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affect our segment results. These changes, which are detailed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017, include the realignment of certain businesses within our segments, as well as changes to certain allocation methodologies to better reflect the ongoing nature of our businesses. The prior period comparatives reflected in the tables below have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. See Note 4 - Segment Information within Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of these changes.\nSegment revenues exclude amounts that were directly incurred on behalf of our clients and reimbursed by them (reimbursed expenses); however, these amounts are included in consolidated revenues.\nThe Merger affects the comparability of this data between 2015 and other periods presented. See \u2018Supplementary Pro Forma Segment Revenues Analysis' for additional analysis.\nHuman Capital and Benefits (\u2018HCB')\nThe HCB segment provides an array of advice, broking, solutions and software for our clients.\nHCB is the largest segment of the Company, generating approximately 39% of our segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Retirement revenues increased in Western Europe, International and Great Britain and were partially offset by a decline in North America. The decline in North America was expected as bulk lump sum projects declined year over year. Actuarial consulting projects in Great Britain were strong due to regulation changes. The growth in Talent & Rewards was flat. Healthcare consulting revenues in Health and Benefits were up significantly for all markets globally. North America grew due to increased consulting and product demand and Great Britain grew due to global benefits solutions implementations. Revenue in the Technology and Administration Solutions business in Great Britain experienced strong growth as a result of new administration clients and project activity.\nThe table below presents segment commissions and fees and segment interest and other income for HCB for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As reported change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions and fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>432\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>434\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHCB total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $3.1 billion, compared to $584 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $2.5 billion or 434%.

International's growth was fueled by excellent client retention and strong new business. Western Europe, North America and Great Britain experienced good client retention and solid new business growth.\nThe table below presents segment commissions and fees and segment interest and other income for CRB for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As reported change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions and fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCRB total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $2.5 billion, compared to $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $198 million or 8%. The growth for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of Gras Savoye, which occurred on December 29, 2015. Great Britain led organic growth with solid revenue increases across all lines of business. Western Europe contributed to organic growth with strong growth in Iberia, partially offset by softness in Italy. North America was flat with strong retention offset by lower new business. International organic revenue declined as a result of lower revenues in Asia and Australasia, partially offset by better performance in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (\u2018CEEMEA').\nInvestment, Risk and Reinsurance (\u2018IRR')\nThe IRR segment uses a sophisticated approach to risk, which helps clients free up capital and manage investment complexity. The segment works closely with investors, reinsurers and insurers to manage the equation between risk and return. Blending advanced analytics with deep institutional knowledge, IRR identifies new opportunities to maximize performance. IRR provides investment consulting services and insurance specific services and solutions through reserves opinions, software, ratemaking, usage-based insurance, risk underwriting and reinsurance broking.\nThis segment is our third largest segment and generated approximately 19% of segment revenues for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Wholesale Insurance Broking, Investment, Insurance Consulting and Technology, Max Matthiessen and Willis Re all posted commissions and fees revenue growth, primarily as a result of strong sales and increased performance fees. Willis Towers Watson Securities growth was flat. The reduction in Portfolio and Underwriting Services commissions and fees was driven by a loss of profit commissions following the Atlantic hurricanes, the cancellation of a key contract, and the divestiture of small programs in the portfolio.\nThe table below presents segment commissions and fees and segment interest and other income for IRR for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As reported change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions and fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIRR total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1.5 billion, compared to $896 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $638 million or 71%.

A significant portion of the revenues in this segment is recurring in nature, driven by either the commissions from the policies we sell, or from long-term service contracts with our clients that typically range from three to five years. Revenues across this segment may be seasonal, driven by the magnitude and timing of client transition activities, and we typically increase our membership levels significantly effective January 1, after calendar year-end benefits elections.\nBDA generated approximately 9% of our segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Individual Marketplace revenues increased by 10%, and the rest of the segment grew by 14%, led by Group Marketplace and Benefits Outsourcing. Growth in the Individual and Group Marketplaces resulted from the additional 2017 enrollments, and Benefits Outsourcing's growth was a result of new client wins and special projects.\nSee the \u2018Supplementary Pro Forma Segment Revenues' section below for additional discussion of our 2016 results.\nCosts of Providing Services\nTotal costs of providing services were $7.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $128 million, or 2%. Total costs of providing services were $7.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $3.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $3.9 billion. See the analysis below for further information.\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were $4.7 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, an increase of $99 million. The increase was primarily a result of a $36 million pension settlement charge related to our U.K. pension plan as well as higher incentive accruals as compared to the prior year. Salaries and benefits for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $4.6 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, an increase of $2.3 billion. The increase in expenses was primarily driven by the Merger and our acquisition of Gras Savoye. As a percentage of revenues, salaries and benefits expenses represented 58%, 59% and 60% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses include occupancy, legal, marketing, licenses, royalties, supplies, technology, printing and telephone costs, as well as insurance, including premiums on excess insurance and losses on professional liability claims, non-client-reimbursed travel by colleagues, publications, professional subscriptions and development, recruitment, other professional fees and irrecoverable value added and sales taxes.\nOther operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, a decrease of $17 million. The decrease was due primarily to the Stanford litigation provision of $50 million in 2016, partially offset by reserves for the City of Houston and CalPERS litigations and increases in other litigation reserves and professional services in 2017. Other operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $1.6 billion and $718 million, respectively, an increase of $833 million. The increase was primarily driven by the Merger and our acquisition of Gras Savoye.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation represents the expense incurred over the useful life of our tangible fixed assets and internally developed software. Depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $203 million and $178 million, respectively, an increase of $25 million. This increase was due primarily to a higher depreciable base of assets resulting from additional assets placed in service in 2016. Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $178 million and $95 million, respectively, an increase of $83 million. This increase was primarily driven by the Merger and our acquisition of Gras Savoye.\nAmortization\nAmortization includes amortization of acquired intangible assets, including acquired internally developed software. Amortization for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $581 million and $591 million, respectively, a decrease of $10 million. Our intangible amortization is more heavily weighted to the initial years of the useful lives of the related intangibles, and therefore amortization expense will decrease over time. Amortization for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $591 million and $76 million, respectively, an increase of $515 million. The primary driver of the increase in amortization was our acquisition of approximately $4.0 billion in intangible assets in our Merger with Towers Watson and our acquisition of $231 million and $440 million of intangible assets related to our acquisitions of Miller and Gras Savoye, respectively.\nRestructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $132 million, all of which related to the final year of the Operational Improvement Program (\u2018OIP'). Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $193 million, of which $145 million related to the OIP and $48 million related to the Business Restructuring Program. Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $126 million, all of which was related to the OIP. See our discussion in the Operational Improvement Program and Business Restructuring Program section herein and Note 5 - Restructuring Costs within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details about these expenses.\nTransaction and integration expenses\nTransaction and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $269 million, which consists of costs associated with our information technology and finance initiatives and rationalization, property consolidation, benefits harmonization and costs associated with the settlement of the Merger-related appraisal demand lawsuit (see Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Transaction and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $177 million. Approximately $162 million of these expenses were related to the Merger and $15 million were related to the acquisition of Gras Savoye. Transaction and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $84 million. Approximately $58 million of these expenses were related to the Merger, $15 million were related to the acquisition of Gras Savoye and $11 million were related to our acquisition of Miller.\nIncome from Operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $738 million compared to $551 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $187 million, or 34%. This increase resulted primarily from additional revenue of $315 million driven by growth across all segments, partially offset by additional costs resulting primarily from our integration activities and additional salary and benefits costs. Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $551 million compared to $427 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $124 million or 29%. The growth in income from operations compared to that of 2015 was primarily driven by the Merger and our acquisition of Gras Savoye.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $188 million, $184 million and $142 million, respectively. Interest expense is primarily related to interest on our senior notes and term loans. Interest expense increased by $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which primarily resulted from additional levels of indebtedness. Interest expense increased by $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily related to additional debt acquired in the Merger and as part of the acquisition of Gras Savoye.\nOther Expense/(Income), Net\nOther expense/(income), net, includes other gains and losses, including gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other expense/(income), net for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was expense of $61 million and $27 million, respectively, which were primarily foreign currency transaction losses. Other expense/(income), net for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015 was income of $55 million, which included gains on disposals of operations of $25 million, and a gain on re-measurement of equity interests related to the Gras Savoye acquisition of $59 million, partially offset by the $30 million impact of the Venezuelan currency devaluation.\nBenefit from Income Taxes\nBenefit from income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $100 million, $96 million and $33 million, respectively. The benefit in 2017 was primarily due to the impact of U.S. Tax Reform. The provisional net benefit of $204 million includes a $208 million net benefit due to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate and re-measurement of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities primarily related to acquisition-based intangibles. The benefit from income taxes in 2016 was primarily due to the release of a portion of U.S. valuation allowances and shifts in the global mix of income as a result of the Merger. This shift resulted in additional deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates, which reduced the global effective tax rate. The benefit from income taxes in 2015 was primarily due to an income tax benefit from the release of a portion of U.S. valuation allowances.\nNet income attributable to Willis Towers Watson\nNet income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $568 million, an increase of $148 million compared to $420 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by an improvement of $187 million in income from operations partially offset by a $34 million increase to expense in other expense/(income), net. Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $420 million, an increase of $47 million compared to $373 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The growth was primarily driven by an improvement of $124 million in income from operations and an increase of $63 million in the benefit from income taxes, partially offset by a $42 million increase in interest expense and an $82 million increase to expense in other expense/(income), net.\nSupplementary Pro Forma Financial Information\nTo assist the reader in understanding our comparative analysis, we have included discussion and analysis of pro forma financial information for Willis Towers Watson as if the Towers Watson Merger had occurred on January 1, 2015.\nThe pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2015 combines: (i) the historical consolidated statement of operations of Willis Towers Watson for the year ended December 31, 2015 and (ii) the historical consolidated statement of operations of Towers Watson for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 less the historical consolidated statement of operations of Towers Watson for the six months ended December 31, 2014, plus the historical consolidated statement of operations of Towers Watson for the six months ended December 31, 2015.\nThe pro forma financial information is only for Willis and Towers Watson and does not include Gras Savoye or other merger or acquisition activity on a pro forma basis.\nPro forma financial information is for illustrative purposes only, and is based on adjustments that are estimates based upon available information and certain assumptions that Willis Towers Watson management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, as described in \u2018Pro Forma Adjustments' below. The pro forma financial information has not been adjusted to give effect to certain expected financial benefits of the Merger, such as revenue synergies, tax savings and cost synergies, or the anticipated costs to achieve these benefits, including the cost of integration activities. The pro forma financial information does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations of Willis Towers Watson would have been had the Merger occurred on the date indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations. The actual results of operations will differ, potentially significantly, from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to a variety of factors, including access to additional information, changes in value not currently identified and changes in operating results following the date of the unaudited pro forma financial information.\nPro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(in millions of

This growth was driven by a 7% increase due to our acquisitions of Gras Savoye and Miller and 1% organic revenue growth, partially offset by adverse foreign currency exchange movements of 3%. The primary drivers of our growth were within our Corporate Risk and Broking and Benefits Delivery and\nAdministration, formerly Exchange Solutions, segments. See our segment revenues analysis for a further discussion of our segment results.\nOur results can be materially impacted by changes in currency conversions, which can fluctuate significantly over the course of a calendar year. For the year ended December 31, 2016, currency translation decreased our consolidated revenues by $202 million on a constant currency basis from the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015. The primary currency driving the change was the Pound sterling which weakened against the U.S. dollar during 2016.\nThe organic change presented above includes the reduction to revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue made during purchase accounting for the Merger. If this revenue had not been reduced, the constant currency change would have been an increase of 9% and the organic change would have been an increase of 2%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDefinitions of Constant Currency Change and Organic Change are included in the section entitled \u2018Non-GAAP Financial Measures' in this Form 10-K.\nCosts of Providing Services\nTotal costs of providing services were $7.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $6.7 billion for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $609 million or 9%. See the analysis below for further information.\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits were $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $215 million, or 5%, compared to $4.4 billion for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily related to our acquisitions of Gras Savoye and Miller, which contributed approximately $291 million of the increase, partially offset by increased net periodic benefit credits from the adoption of the granular approach to calculating service and interest costs of $51 million.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses include occupancy, legal, marketing, licenses, royalties, supplies, technology, printing and telephone costs, as well as insurance, including premiums on excess insurance and losses on professional liability claims, non-client-reimbursed travel by colleagues, publications, professional subscriptions and development, recruitment, other professional fees and irrecoverable value added and sales taxes.\nOther operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1.6 billion, compared to $1.4 billion for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $105 million or 7%. The increase was primarily related to our acquisitions of Gras Savoye and Miller, which contributed approximately $135 million of the increase. In 2016, we accrued $50 million for the Stanford litigation, which was $20 million less than the $70 million accrued in 2015.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation represents the expense incurred over the useful life of our tangible fixed assets and internally developed software. Depreciation was $178 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $19 million, or 12%, compared to $159 million for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily related to our acquisitions of Gras Savoye and Miller and our normal capital expenditures.\nAmortization\nAmortization includes amortization of acquired intangible assets, including acquired internally developed software. Amortization was $591 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $56 million, or 10%, compared to $535 million for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in amortization in 2016 is primarily due to amortization of the intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions of Gras Savoye and Miller. We acquired approximately $231 million and $440 million in intangible assets in our acquisitions of Miller and Gras Savoye, respectively. These intangible assets are amortized over their expected lives which range from 4 to 25 years. See Note 3 - Merger, Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 8 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our intangible assets.\nTransaction and integration expenses\nTransaction and integration expenses were $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $147 million compared to $30 million for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in 2016 is primarily due to integration expenses incurred subsequent to the Merger. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately $162 million of these\nexpenses were related to the Merger and $15 million were related to the integration of Gras Savoye. For the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015, transaction expenses related to the Merger of $151 million have been eliminated as part of the pro forma adjustments. Of the remaining $30 million of transaction and integration expenses, approximately $15 million were related to Gras Savoye, $11 million were related to Miller, and $4 million were related to other miscellaneous M&A activity.\nRestructuring costs and Interest expense\nPlease see the discussion in the \u2018As Reported Consolidated Financial Information' section above.\nIncome from Operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $551 million, compared to $765 million for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $214 million. The decrease was primarily due to increases in transaction and integration expenses of $147 million and restructuring costs of $67 million.\nOther Expense/(Income), Net\nOther expense/(income), net, includes other gains and losses, including gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other expense/(income), net, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $27 million of net expense, which was primarily foreign currency transaction losses. Other expense/(income), net for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015 was $112 million of net income, which was primarily due to $80 million of gains on disposals of operations and $59 million in the gain on the re-measurement of equity interests, partially offset by $30 million in foreign currency transaction losses in 2015.\n(Benefit from)/Provision for Income Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, there was a $96 million benefit from income taxes, due primarily to a benefit from the release of a portion of our U.S. valuation allowances and shifts in the global mix of income as a result of the Merger. This shift creates additional deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates, which reduces the global effective tax rate. For the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015, there was a provision for income taxes of $70 million. Legacy Willis had a benefit from income taxes due to the release of a portion of U.S. valuation allowances in 2015 which was more than offset by the provision for income taxes for Legacy Towers Watson.\nNet Income Attributable to Willis Towers Watson\nNet income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $420 million, a decrease of $220 million compared to $640 million for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by increased transaction and integration expenses of $147 million and restructuring costs of $67 million in 2016 and gains on disposals of $80 million and re-measurement of equity interests of $59 million in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense of $166 million.\nSupplementary Pro Forma Segment Revenues\nBeginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affect our segment results. These changes, which are detailed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017, include the realignment of certain businesses within our segments, as well as changes to certain allocation methodologies to better reflect the ongoing nature of our businesses. The prior period comparatives reflected in the tables below have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. See Note 4 - Segment Information within Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of these changes.\nHuman Capital and Benefits\nThe following table sets out the components of HCB revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the pro forma prior year.\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Components of Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pro Forma\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pro Forma Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Currency Impact\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant Currency Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisitions/Divestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Organic Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHCB total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3.1 billion; commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $3.1 billion, compared with pro forma $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing an increase of $63 million to total segment revenues and an increase of $62 million to commissions and fees. Pro forma and constant currency revenue growth were driven by the acquisition of Gras Savoye, which occurred on December 29, 2015. In an effort to align resources and market demand, a significant restructuring across all lines of business took place during the second half of 2016, which caused disruption in our billable hours. Across the segment, performance was mixed, resulting in flat organic growth. Retirement revenues declined slightly as a result of reduced actuarial consulting, primarily in the fourth quarter. The Health and Benefits North America consulting business continued to see demand for plan design projects and increased product revenue. The Talent and Rewards advisory business was down period-over-period as the M&A market softened. The Technology and Administration Solutions Great Britain business had strong performance, led by increased project and administration activity along with new clients. Internationally, Global Wealth Solutions has been negatively impacted by adverse conditions in the Greater China market.\nCorporate Risk and Broking\nThe following table sets out the components of CRB revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the pro forma prior year.\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Components of Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pro Forma\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pro Forma Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Currency Impact\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant Currency Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisitions/Divestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Organic Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCRB total segment and commissions and fees revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $2.5 billion, compared to pro forma $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. The growth for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to the acquisition of Gras Savoye, which occurred on December 29, 2015. International organic revenue declined as a result of lower revenues in Asia and Australasia, partially offset by better performance in Latin America and CEEMEA. Offsetting the International decline was Great Britain's organic growth as a result of solid revenue increases across all lines of business. Western Europe contributed to organic growth with strong revenue gains in Iberia, partially offset by softness in Italy. North America was flat with strong retention offset by lower new business.\nInvestment, Risk and Reinsurance\nThe following table sets out the components of IRR revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the pro forma prior year.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Components of Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pro Forma\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pro Forma Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Currency Impact\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant Currency Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisitions/Divestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Organic Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIRR total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.5 billion.

Commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.5 billion, representing a decrease of $7 million. The organic decline was primarily related to the following factors: soft market conditions and renewal factors impacting our Willis Re and Portfolio and Underwriting Services businesses, particularly in North America; a decline in overall insurance industry M&A activity impacting our Willis Towers Watson Securities business after a record year in 2015; and a decline arising from lower demand in risk consulting projects.\nBenefit Delivery and Administration\nThe following table sets out the components of BDA revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the pro forma prior year.\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Components of Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pro Forma\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pro Forma Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Currency Impact\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant Currency Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisitions/Divestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Organic Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBDA total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $654 million, compared to pro forma $487 million for the year ended December 31, 2015; and commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $652 million, compared to pro forma $484 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Individual Marketplace commissions and fees increased by 41%, primarily as a result of the record 2016 annual enrollment season. The rest of the segment commissions and fees increased by 27%, primarily due to Benefits Outsourcing adding new clients and experiencing higher project activity.\nImpact of U.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as U.S. Tax Reform. U.S. Tax Reform makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to: (1) requiring a one-time transition tax on certain unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that may be payable over eight years; (2) bonus depreciation that will allow for a full expensing of qualified property; (3) reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; (4) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (\u2018GILTI'), which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits (\u2018FTCs') and a deduction of up to 50% to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (5) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (6) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (7) limitations on the use of FTCs to reduce the U.S. income tax liability; (8) the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax (\u2018BEAT'), a new minimum tax; and (9) a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries.\nAlso on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\u2018SAB 118'), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the U.S. Tax Reform. SAB 118 provides for a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the U.S. Tax Reform enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under Accounting Standards Codification (\u2018ASC') 740, Income Taxes (\u2018ASC 740'). In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of U.S. Tax Reform for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. Adjustments to incomplete and unknown amounts will be recorded and disclosed prospectively during the measurement period. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform.\nAt December 31, 2017, there are no material elements of U.S. Tax Reform for which the Company's accounting is complete. While the Company's accounting for the following elements of U.S. Tax Reform is incomplete, the Company was able to make reasonable estimates of certain effects. Accordingly, the Company recorded provisional adjustments for the following significant items:\nReduction of the federal corporate tax rate - Beginning January 1, 2018, the Company's U.S. income will be taxed at a 21% federal corporate tax rate. Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recalculated as of the enactment date using current tax laws and rates expected to be in effect when the deferred tax items reverse in future periods, which is 21%. Consequently, the Company has recorded a provisional decrease in its net deferred tax liabilities of $208 million, with a corresponding deferred income tax benefit of $208 million. While the Company is able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, it may be affected by other analyses related to U.S. Tax Reform that could result in other adjustments to U.S. federal deferred tax balances, including analysis of tax amounts in other comprehensive income and any future guidance issued.\nOne-time transition tax - The one-time transition tax is based on the Company's total post-1986 earnings and profits (\u2018E&P') that it previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The Company recorded a provisional amount for the one-\ntime transition tax liability for its foreign subsidiaries owned by U.S. corporate shareholders, resulting in an increase in U.S. federal income tax expense of $70 million and state income tax expense of $2 million. The Company has a significant number of foreign subsidiaries and therefore has not yet completed its calculation of the total post-1986 E&P as well as non-U.S. income taxes paid for these foreign subsidiaries. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets, including trade receivables based on estimates. The Company expects to revise its estimates of E&P, non-U.S. income taxes and cash balances throughout 2018 when actual results are available. In addition, guidance may be released which could also impact these estimates.\nIndefinite reinvestment assertion - Beginning in 2018, U.S. Tax Reform provides a 100% deduction for dividends received from 10-percent owned foreign corporations by U.S. corporate shareholders, subject to a one-year holding period. Although dividend income is now exempt from U.S. federal tax for U.S. corporate shareholders, companies must still account for the tax consequences of outside basis differences and other tax impacts of their investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. As a result of U.S. Tax Reform we have analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a repatriation and have determined that we may repatriate up to $219 million, the majority of which was previously deemed indefinitely reinvested. For those investments from which we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of such repatriation, we have recorded a provisional estimate for foreign withholding and state income taxes of $1 million. In addition, we re-measured the existing deferred tax liability accrued on certain acquired Towers Watson subsidiaries and released the deferred tax liability relating to the outside basis difference. This resulted in an income tax benefit of $76 million as these foreign earnings were subject to the one-time transition tax which reduced the outside basis difference.\nBonus Depreciation - While the Company has not completed its determination of all capital expenditures that qualify for immediate expensing, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provisional tax deduction of $40 million based on its current intent to fully expense all qualifying expenditures. The Company will analyze the dates all capital expenditures were placed in service or acquired and consider any future guidance within the next twelve months to finalize the deduction. This resulted in an increase of approximately $14 million to the Company's U.S. federal current income taxes receivable and a corresponding increase in its net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $14 million.\nExecutive compensation - Starting with compensation paid in 2018, Section 162(m) will limit the Company from deducting compensation, including performance-based compensation, in excess of $1 million paid to anyone who, starting in 2018, serves as the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or who is among the three most highly compensated executive officers. The only exception to this rule is for compensation that is paid pursuant to a binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 that would have otherwise been deductible under the prior Section 162(m) rules. Accordingly, any compensation paid in the future pursuant to new compensation arrangements entered into after November 2, 2017, even if performance-based, will count towards the $1 million deduction limit if paid to a covered executive. The Company recorded a provisional income tax expense of $8 million relating to our compensation plans not qualifying for the binding contract exception. We are in the process of obtaining additional information needed to complete our analysis of the binding contract requirement on the various compensation plans to determine the full impact of the law change. In addition, guidance may be released which could also impact our estimates.\nThe Company's accounting for the following law changes of U.S. Tax Reform is incomplete, and it is not yet able to make reasonable estimates of the effects. Therefore, no provisional adjustment was recorded.\nGILTI - U.S. Tax Reform creates a new requirement that certain income (i.e., GILTI) earned by controlled foreign corporations (\u2018CFCs') must be included currently in the gross income of the CFCs' U.S. shareholder. GILTI is the excess of the shareholder's \u2018net CFC tested income' over the net deemed tangible income return, which is currently defined as the excess of (1) 10 percent of the aggregate of the U.S. shareholder's pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder over (2) the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net CFC-tested income. Because of the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, the Company is continuing to evaluate this provision of U.S. Tax Reform and the application of ASC 740. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the \u2018period cost method') or (2) factoring such amounts into a company's measurement of its deferred taxes (the \u2018deferred method'). The Company's selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new GILTI tax rules will depend, in part, on analyzing its global income of its CFCs to determine whether it expects to have future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI and, if so, what the impact is expected to be. Because whether the Company expects to have future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI depends on not only its current structure and estimated future results of global operations but also its intent and ability to modify its structure and/or its business, the Company is not yet able to reasonably estimate the effect of this provision of U.S. Tax Reform. Therefore, it has not made any adjustments related to potential GILTI tax in its consolidated financial statements and has not made a policy decision.\nValuation allowances - The Company must assess whether valuation allowances assessments are affected by various aspects of U.S. Tax Reform (e.g., limitation on net interest expense in excess of 30% of adjusted taxable income). As of December 31, 2017, no changes to valuation allowances have been recorded as a result of U.S. Tax Reform.\nRestructuring Programs\nOperational Improvement Program\nIn April 2014, Legacy Willis announced a multi-year operational improvement program designed to strengthen its client service capabilities and deliver future cost savings. The main elements of the program, which was completed during 2017, included: moving more than 3,500 support roles from higher cost locations to facilities in lower cost locations; net workforce reductions in support positions; lease consolidation in real estate; and information technology systems simplification and rationalization.\nThe Company is expecting to deliver $325 million of annual cost savings beginning in 2018. To achieve these savings, it has incurred cumulative restructuring charges of $441 million for the program since it began in the second quarter of 2014.\nAn analysis of cumulative restructuring costs recognized for the Operational Improvement Program from its commencement through the year ended December 31, 2017 by segment is as follows:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

in certain portions of the business due to a reduction in business demand or change in business focus (hereinafter referred to as the Business Restructure Program). The main element of the program included workforce reductions, and was completed in 2016.\nRestructuring costs related to the Business Restructuring Program for the year ended December 31, 2016 by segment are as follows:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>HCB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CRB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IRR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Termination benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services and other (i)\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>Other includes salary and benefits, premises, and other expenses incurred to support the ongoing management and facilitation of the programs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nExecutive Summary\nOur principal sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities or new debt offerings.\nBased on our balance sheets, combined cash flows, current market conditions and information available to us at this time, we believe that Willis Towers Watson has sufficient liquidity, which includes our undrawn revolving credit facilities, to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months, including investing in the business for growth, creating value through the integration of Willis, Towers Watson and Gras Savoye, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments, and contemplated share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the Company expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner, such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments. Beginning in 2016, as a result of our plan to restructure or distribute accumulated earnings of certain acquired Towers Watson foreign operations, we accrued deferred taxes on the historical and current year earnings of those subsidiaries. The historical cumulative earnings of our other subsidiaries had been reinvested indefinitely and therefore we had not provided deferred tax liabilities on these amounts. As a result of U.S. Tax Reform we have analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a repatriation. For those investments from which we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of such repatriation, we have recorded a provisional estimate for foreign withholding and state income taxes. In addition, we re-measured the existing deferred tax liability accrued on certain acquired Towers Watson subsidiaries and released the deferred tax liability relating to the outside basis difference. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital, long-term investment requirements or additional guidance relating to U.S. Tax Reform necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for income and foreign withholding taxes, net of credits, may be necessary. Other potential sources of cash may be through the settlement of intercompany loans or return of capital distributions in a tax-efficient manner.\nEvents that could change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include significant changes in operating results, potential future acquisitions or divestitures, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or regulatory matters, or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we (i) entered into a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility to replace our previous $800 million revolving credit facility. Borrowings against the $1.25 billion facility of $409 million and \u20ac45 million were used to repay all outstanding borrowings against the $800 million facility and the 7-year term loan due July 23, 2018; (ii) repaid our 6.200% senior notes due 2017 totaling $407 million, including accrued interest; and (iii) completed an offering of $650 million of 3.600% Senior Notes due 2024. Net proceeds of $644 million were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nOur cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 totaled $1.0 billion, compared to $870 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in cash from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the strengthening of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly the Pound sterling and Euro and less net debt payments made in the current year.\nAdditionally, at December 31, 2017, $362 million was available to draw against our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility as compared to $557 million, which was available to draw against our previous $800 million revolving credit facility at December 31, 2016.\nIncluded within cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are amounts held for regulatory capital adequacy requirements, including $90 million and $87 million, respectively, held within our regulated U.K. entities.\nSummarized Consolidated Cash Flows\nThe following table presents the summarized consolidated cash flow information for the years ended:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash from/(used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>(335\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(943\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>(479\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(775\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>640\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INCREASE/(DECREASE) IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, BEGINNING OF YEAR\n</td> <td>870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>635\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, END OF YEAR\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>532\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities were $862 million for 2017, compared to cash flows from operating activities of $933 million for 2016. The $862 million net cash from operating activities for 2017 included net income of $592 million, adjusted for $548 million of non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $278 million. The $548 million non-cash adjustments primarily include depreciation, amortization, and the benefit from deferred income taxes. The $71 million decrease in cash from operations in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily resulted from changes in working capital and higher discretionary compensation payments made in 2017 for the 2016 compensation cycle. These discretionary compensation payments were lower in 2016 because they included only a partial payment to Legacy Towers Watson colleagues due to the timing of the Merger.\nCash flows from operating activities were $933 million for 2016, compared to cash flows of from operating activities of $244 million for 2015. The $933 million net cash from operating activities for 2016 included net income of $438 million, adjusted for $590 million of non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $95 million. The $590 million of non-cash adjustments primarily include depreciation, amortization, net defined benefit pension credits, share-based compensation, and the benefit from deferred income taxes. The $689 million increase in cash from operations in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to cash from operations from Legacy Towers Watson and Gras Savoye.\nCash flows from operating activities for 2015 was $244 million, which included net income of $384 million, adjusted for $38 million of non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to cash used in operating activities, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $178 million.\nCash Flows (Used In)/From Investing Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities for 2017 were $335 million, largely driven by $375 million of capital expenditures and capitalized software costs.\nCash flows from investing activities for 2016 were $195 million, largely driven by $476 million of cash acquired as a result of our Merger with Towers Watson, which was a non-cash transaction as it was consummated through the issuance of shares. Cash inflows were partially offset by $303 million of fixed assets and software for internal use and capitalized costs of developing software.\nCash flows used in investing activities of $943 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily driven by $857 million used in the acquisitions of operations and $146 million for capital expenditures.\nCash Flows (Used In)/From Financing Activities\nCash flows used in financing activities for 2017 were $479 million. The significant financing activities included the payment of $177 million related to the cancellation of Towers Watson shares in connection with the settlement of the Merger-related appraisal demand lawsuit (consisting of the portion of the settlement equal to the value of consideration that would have been\ndue to the shareholders at the closing of the Merger if they had exchanged their shares; see Part II, Item 8. Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings for additional information), share repurchases of $532 million and dividend payments of $277 million, which were partially offset by net borrowings of $580 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2016 was $775 million. The primary drivers during the period were debt issuance of $2.0 billion, debt repayments of $1.9 billion, net payments on the revolving credit facility of $237 million, dividend payments of $199 million, and share repurchases of $396 million. The debt issuance of $2.0 billion was primarily the issuance of $450 million of senior notes due 2021, $550 million of senior notes due 2026, \u20ac540 million ($609 million) of senior notes due 2022 and a $400 million drawdown on the 1-year term loan facility. The debt repayments of $1.9 billion were primarily $300 million repayment of senior notes due 2016, $400 million repayment of Legacy Towers Watson debt and repayments of $592 million and $400 million on the 1-year term loan facility.\nNet cash from financing activities in 2015 was $640 million, primarily due to $469 million net drawings on the revolving credit facility, a $592 million term loan draw down to fund the acquisition of Gras Savoye, and the issuance of shares of $131 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $277 million and repurchase of shares of $82 million.\nIndebtedness\nTotal debt, total equity, and the capitalization ratio at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were as follows:\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>508\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Willis Towers Watson shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalization ratio\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2017, our material mandatory debt repayments over the next twelve months consist of scheduled repayments of $85 million on our term loan maturing in 2019.\nIn March 2017, we entered into a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility replacing our previous $800 million revolving credit facility. Borrowings against the $1.25 billion facility of $409 million and \u20ac45 million were used to repay all outstanding borrowings against the $800 million facility and the 7-year term loan due July 23, 2018.\nAdditionally in March 2017, the Company repaid the 6.200% senior notes due 2017 totaling $407 million, including accrued interest.\nIn May 2017, we completed an offering of $650 million of 3.600% senior notes due 2024. Net proceeds of $644 million were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nAt December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants.\nFiduciary Funds\nAs an intermediary, we hold funds, generally in a fiduciary capacity, for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from, clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both Fiduciary assets and Fiduciary liabilities on our balance sheets.\nFiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity; such funds are not available to service the Company's debt or for other corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds.\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had fiduciary funds of $3.3 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.\nShare Repurchase Program\nThe Company is authorized to repurchase shares, by way of redemption, and will consider whether to do so from time to time, based on many factors, including market conditions.\nOn April 20, 2016, the Willis Towers Watson board reconfirmed, reapproved and reauthorized the remaining portion of the Legacy Willis program to repurchase the Company's ordinary shares on the open market or by way of redemption or otherwise.\nOn November 10, 2016, the Company announced the board of directors approved an increase to the existing share repurchase program of $1 billion. The $1 billion increase was in addition to the remaining authority on the Legacy Willis program discussed in the preceding paragraph. At December 31, 2017, approximately $601 million remained on the current repurchase authority. The maximum number of shares that could be repurchased based on the closing price of our ordinary shares on December 31, 2017 of $150.69 was 3,986,473.\nOn February 23, 2018, the board of directors approved an increase to the existing share repurchase program of $400 million. The $400 million increase is in addition to the remaining authority of $601 million as of December 31, 2017.\nThere are no expiration dates for these repurchase plans or programs. The following table presents specified information about the Company's repurchases of ordinary shares for the year ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,797,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average price per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$140.19\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate repurchase cost (excluding broker costs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$532 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the shares reported in the table above, the Company canceled 1,415,199 Towers Watson common shares at issue in the settlement of the Merger-related appraisal demand lawsuit (see Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies located within Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information) and an equivalent number of ordinary shares represented in the Company's issued and outstanding share count up until the settlement date. As a result, the litigation settlement and related share cancellation had a similar impact to a share repurchase in that it reduced the number of outstanding shares of the Company. However, it did not impact the remaining authority under the share repurchase program.\nCapital Commitments\nThe Company has no material commitments for capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures for fixed assets and software for internal use were $300 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Expected capital expenditures for fixed assets and software for internal use are approximately $285 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect cash from operations to adequately provide for these cash needs.\nDividends\nTotal cash dividends of $277 million were paid during the year ended December 31, 2017. In February 2018, the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.60 per share ($2.40 per share annualized rate), which will be paid on or about April 16, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 31, 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nApart from commitments, guarantees and contingencies, as disclosed herein and Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies located within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference, as of December 31, 2017, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company's material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 are as follows:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019-2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021-2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 2022\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt and related interest obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loans\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving $1.25 billion credit facility\n</td> <td>884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on senior notes\n</td> <td>1,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt and related interest obligations\n</td> <td>5,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>1,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>585\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K. pension contractual obligations\n</td> <td>442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition liabilities\n</td> <td>103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other contractual obligations (i)\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>Other contractual obligations include capital lease commitments, put option obligations and investment fund capital call obligations, the timing of which are included at the earliest point they may fall due.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Debt obligations and facilities - The Company's material debt and related interest obligations at December 31, 2017 are shown in the above table. Mandatory repayments of debt over the next 12 months include the scheduled repayment of the current portion of the Company's 2019 term loan. The Company also has the right, at its option, to prepay indebtedness under the credit facility without further penalty and to redeem the senior notes by paying a \u2018make-whole' premium as provided under the applicable debt instrument.\nOperating Leases - We lease office space and furniture under operating lease agreements with terms typically ranging from three to twenty years. We have determined that there is not a large concentration of leases that will expire in any one fiscal year. Consequently, management anticipates that any increase in future rent expense on leases will be mainly market-driven. We also lease cars and selected computer equipment under operating lease agreements. For acquired operating leases, intangible assets or liabilities have been recognized for the difference between the contractual cash obligations and the estimated market rates at the time of acquisition. These intangibles are amortized to rent expense but do not affect our contractual cash obligations. See further discussion in Item 8, Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPension Contributions - The Company has agreed with Trustees of certain plans in the U.K. to contribute deficit funding and minimum ongoing accrual of benefits funding and presented those obligations in the table above. These obligations exclude employee contributions and any potential funding level contributions, which are dependent on future funding level assessments. There are no contractual obligations for our U.S. pension plans. Our total expected contributions to all qualified pension plans, including amounts presented above, for the year ending December 31, 2018 are projected to be $150 million. Additionally, the Company expects to pay $54 million in benefits directly to participants for the year ended 2018.\nTax Related Liabilities -\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Uncertain Tax Positions - The table above does not include liabilities for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, Income Taxes.

The Company can and will elect to pay this one-time tax liability over an eight-year period without interest. The one-time transition tax cannot be reasonably estimated because the Company has a significant number of foreign subsidiaries and therefore has not yet completed its calculation of the total post-1986 E&P as well as non-U.S. income taxes paid for these foreign subsidiaries. The Company expects to revise its estimates throughout 2018 when actual results become available. Future guidance may be released which could also impact these estimates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGuarantees, Acquisition Liabilities and Other Contractual Obligations - Information regarding guarantees and other contractual obligations and their impact on the financial statements is set forth in Item 8, Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nClaims, Lawsuits and Other Proceedings, including Stanford Financial Group Litigation - Information regarding claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, including the Stanford Financial Group litigation, and their impact on the consolidated financial statements is set forth in Item 8, Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn order to assist readers of our consolidated financial statements in understanding the core operating results that Willis Towers Watson's management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning purposes, we present the following non-GAAP measures and their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Most Directly Comparable U.S. GAAP Measure\n</td> <td>Non-GAAP Measure\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>Adjusted revenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As reported change\n</td> <td>Constant currency change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As reported change\n</td> <td>Organic change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>Adjusted operating income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson\n</td> <td>Adjusted net income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>Adjusted diluted earnings per share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates\n</td> <td>Adjusted income before taxes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes/U.S. GAAP tax rate\n</td> <td>Adjusted income taxes/tax rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash from operating activities\n</td> <td>Free cash flow\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company believes that these measures are relevant and provide useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry to provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing our operating performance, and in the case of free cash flow, our liquidity results.\nWithin the measures referred to as adjusted\u201d, we have adjusted for significant items which will not be settled in cash, or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations.

Adjusted income taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate.\nManagement believes the adjusted income tax rate presents a rate that is more closely aligned to the rate we would incur if not for the reduction of pre-tax income for the adjusted items, the tax effects of our internal reorganizations and the tax effect of U.S. Tax Reform, which are not core to our current and future operations.\nReconciliations of income from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates to adjusted income before taxes and provision for/(benefit from) income taxes to adjusted income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 (ii)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INCOME FROM OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND INTEREST IN EARNINGS OF ASSOCIATES\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted for certain items:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization\n</td> <td>581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>591\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring costs\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction and integration expenses\n</td> <td>269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for Stanford and other significant litigation\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension settlement and curtailment gains and losses\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposal of operations\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Venezuela currency devaluation\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted income before taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit from income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(96\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax effect on certain items listed above(i)\n</td> <td>275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>320\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax effects of internal reorganizations\n</td> <td>(48\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax effect of U.S. Tax Reform\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Deferred tax valuation allowance\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>293\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. GAAP tax rate\n</td> <td>(20.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted income tax rate\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\n(i) The tax effect was calculated using an effective tax rate for each item.\n(ii) We have not presented this measure on a comparative basis with 2015 because it is not practical to present the 2015 adjusted income tax rate on a pro forma basis, as making tax-effected non-GAAP adjustments on a proforma basis would be highly speculative in nature.\nOur adjusted income tax rates were 21.9% and 20.8% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

See Item 8, Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10-K report for a further discussion of this change.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The decrease in free cash flows in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily resulted from higher capital expenditures and higher discretionary compensation payments made in 2017 for the 2016 compensation cycle. These discretionary compensation payments were lower in 2016 because they included only a partial payment to Legacy Towers Watson colleagues due to the timing of the Merger.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThese consolidated financial statements conform to U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. The areas that we believe are critical accounting policies include valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients, discretionary compensation, income taxes, commitments, contingencies and accrued liabilities, pension assumptions, and goodwill and intangible assets. The critical accounting policies discussed below involve making difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. These critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate or assumption. Different estimates that we could have used, or changes in estimates that are reasonably likely to occur, may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nValuation of Billed and Unbilled Receivables from Clients\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the clients' failure to pay for the services after the services have been rendered, including allowances when client disputes may exist. The related provision is recorded as a reduction to revenue. Our allowance policy is based on the aging of the billed and unbilled client receivables and has been developed based on the write-off history. Facts and circumstances such as the average length of time the receivables are past due, general market conditions, current economic trends and our clients' ability to pay may cause fluctuations in our valuation of billed and unbilled receivables.\nDiscretionary Compensation\nOur compensation program includes a discretionary bonus that is determined by management and has historically been paid once per fiscal year in the form of cash and/or deferred stock units after our annual operating results are finalized.\nAn estimated annual bonus amount is initially developed at the beginning of each fiscal year in conjunction with our budgeting process. Estimated annual operating performance is reviewed quarterly and the discretionary annual bonus amount is then adjusted, if necessary, by management to reflect changes in the forecast of pre-bonus profitability for the year.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company adjusts valuation allowances\nto measure deferred tax assets at the amount considered realizable in future periods if the Company's facts and assumptions change. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and the results of recent financial operations. We place more reliance on evidence that is objectively verifiable.\nCommitments, Contingencies and Accrued Liabilities\nWe have established provisions against various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance and consulting services in the ordinary course of business. Such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported. These provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice. In certain cases, where a range of loss exists, we accrue the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.\nSee Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in Item 8 within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPension Assumptions\nWe maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in several countries, with the most significant defined benefit plans offered in the U.S. and U.K. Our disclosures in Note 12 - Retirement Benefits contain additional information about our other less significant but material retirement plans. Within our critical accounting policy discussion, we have excluded analysis for plans outside of those noted in the description below, as any variance of recorded information based on management's estimates would be immaterial.\nDescriptions of our U.S. and U.K. plans, which comprise 91% of our projected benefit obligations and 93% of our plan assets, are below:\nUnited States\nLegacy Willis - This plan was frozen in 2009. Approximately one-quarter of the Legacy Willis employees in the United States have a frozen accrued benefit under this plan.\nWillis Towers Watson Plan - Substantially all U.S. employees are eligible to participate in this plan. Benefits are provided under a stable value pension plan design. The original stable value design came into effect on January 1, 2012. As of July 1, 2017, existing plan participants earn benefits without having to make employee contributions, and all newly eligible employees are required to contribute 2% of pay to participate in the plan.\nUnited Kingdom\nLegacy Willis - This plan covers approximately one third of the Legacy Willis employees in the United Kingdom. The plan is now closed to new entrants. New employees in the United Kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan.\nLegacy Towers Watson - Benefit accruals earned under the Legacy Watson Wyatt defined benefit plan (predominantly pension benefits) ceased on February 28, 2015, although benefits earned prior to January 1, 2008 retain a link to salary until the employee leaves the Company. Benefit accruals earned under the legacy Towers Perrin defined benefit plan (predominantly lump sum benefits) were frozen on March 31, 2008. All participants now accrue defined contribution benefits.\nLegacy Miller - The plan provides retirement benefits based on members' salaries at the point at which they ceased to accrue benefits under the scheme.\nThe determination of the Company's obligations and annual expense under the plans is based on a number of assumptions that, given the longevity of the plans, are long-term in focus. A change in one or a combination of these assumptions could have a material impact on our projected benefit obligation. However, certain of these changes, such as changes in the discount rates and other actuarial assumptions, are not recognized immediately in net income, but are instead recorded in other comprehensive income. The accumulated gains and losses not yet recognized in net income are amortized into net income as a component of the net periodic benefit cost/(credit) based on the average working life expectancy of each of the plan's active participants to the extent that the net gains or losses as of the beginning of the year exceed 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation.\nWillis Towers Watson considers several factors prior to the start of each fiscal year when determining the appropriate annual assumptions, including economic forecasts, relevant benchmarks, historical trends, portfolio composition and peer company comparisons. These assumptions, used to determine our pension liabilities and pension expense are reviewed annually by senior\nmanagement and changed when appropriate. A discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved, whereas the expected long-term return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long term target asset allocations are revised. To calculate the discount rate, we use the granular approach to determining service cost and interest cost. We began using this method to calculate the discount rate in 2016. This was treated as a change in accounting estimate, and resulted in a credit of $51 million included in our total net periodic benefit income. The expected rate of return assumptions for all plans are supported by an analysis of the weighted-average yield expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments. Other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality, and the expected long-term rate of compensation and pension increases.\nFunding is based on actuarially determined contributions and is limited to amounts that are currently deductible for tax purposes, or as agreed to with the plan trustees for the U.K. plans. Since funding calculations are based on different measurements than those used for accounting purposes, pension contributions are not equal to net periodic benefit cost.\nWe recorded a combined $113 million net periodic benefit income for our U.S. and U.K. plans for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the U.S. and U.K. plans, the following table presents our estimated net periodic benefit income for 2018 and the impact to both plans of a 0.25% increase and decrease to both the expected return on assets (\u2018EROA') and the discount rate assumptions, and the projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2017 and the impact of a 0.25% increase and decrease to the discount rates:\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Totals - current estimates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact of 0.25% change to EROA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact of 0.25% change to discount rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Decrease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated 2018 (income):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Plans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(56\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K. Plans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(164\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2017:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Plans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(139\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.K. Plans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(190\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEconomic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets - Impairment Review\nIn applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, with the remainder recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of October 1, and whenever indicators of impairment arise. The fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of October 1, and whenever indicators of impairment arise.\nGoodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, and the Company had nine reporting units as of October 1, 2017.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, the Company performed Step 1 of the two-step impairment test for all reporting units. Each of the reporting units' estimated fair values were in excess of their carrying values. To perform the test, we used valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit that fall under income or market approaches. Under the discounted cash flow method, an income approach, the business enterprise value is determined by discounting to present value the terminal value which is calculated using debt-free after-tax cash flows for a finite period of years. Key estimates in this approach were internal financial projection estimates prepared by management, business risk, and expected rates of return on capital. The guideline company method, a market approach, develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publicly traded companies. Key estimates and selection of valuation multiples rely on the selection of similar companies, obtaining estimates of forecast revenues and EBITDA estimates for the similar companies and selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics. Under the similar transactions method, a market approach, actual transaction prices and operating data from companies deemed reasonably similar to the reporting units is used to develop valuation multiples as an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for the business units.\nIf the Company was required to perform Step 2, we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit used in Step 1 to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including any recognized or unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then the implied fair value of goodwill would be compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine if goodwill is impaired. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not record any impairment losses of goodwill or intangibles.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWhile we are still in the process of analyzing the various Accounting Standards Updates (\u2018ASU') issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u2018FASB'), those which we believe will have a material impact to our financial statements are listed below.

The benefit in 2017 was primarily due to the impact of U.S. Tax Reform. The provisional net benefit of $204 million includes a $208 million net benefit due to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate and re-measurement of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities primarily related to acquisition-based intangibles. The benefit from income taxes in 2016 was primarily due to the release of a portion of U.S. valuation allowances and shifts in the global mix of income as a result of the Merger. This shift resulted in additional deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates, which reduced the global effective tax rate. The benefit from income taxes in 2015 was primarily due to an income tax benefit from the release of a portion of U.S. valuation allowances.\nThrough these strategies we aim to accelerate revenue, cash flow, EBITDA and earnings growth, and generate compelling returns for investors by delivering tangible growth in revenues and capitalizing on the identified cost synergies.\nA reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows:\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As reported change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions and fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $7.9 billion, compared to $3.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $4.1 billion, or 106%.

The organic decline was primarily related to the following factors: soft market conditions and renewal factors impacting our Willis Re and Portfolio and Underwriting Services businesses, particularly in North America; a decline in overall insurance industry M&A activity impacting our Willis Towers Watson Securities business after a record year in 2015; and a decline arising from lower demand in risk consulting projects.\nWe recorded a combined $113 million net periodic benefit income for our U.S. and U.K. plans for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Our intangible amortization is more heavily weighted to the initial years of the useful lives of the related intangibles, and therefore amortization expense will decrease over time. Amortization for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $591 million and $76 million, respectively, an increase of $515 million.

First, for those portions of the business that previously deferred costs (related to system implementation activities), the length of time over which we amortize those costs will extend to a longer estimated contract term. For 2017 calendar year and prior, these costs were amortized over a typical period of 3-5 years in accordance with the initial stated terms of the customer agreements. Second, other types of arrangements with associated costs now meet the criteria for cost deferral under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This guidance will now apply to our broking arrangements and certain consulting engagements. We have calculated a retained earnings adjustment to reflect this cumulative change for contracts not complete as of the transition date. \nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Components of Revenue Change (i)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Reported Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Currency Impact\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant Currency Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisitions/Divestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Organic Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commissions and fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Components of Change (i)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Reported Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Currency Impact\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant Currency Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisitions/Divestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Organic Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nWe have established provisions against various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance and consulting services in the ordinary course of business.

The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the change is enacted.

The only exception to this rule is for compensation that is paid pursuant to a binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 that would have otherwise been deductible under the prior Section 162(m) rules. Accordingly, any compensation paid in the future pursuant to new compensation arrangements entered into after November 2, 2017, even if performance-based, will count towards the $1 million deduction limit if paid to a covered executive. The Company recorded a provisional income tax expense of $8 million relating to our compensation plans not qualifying for the binding contract exception.

software. Depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $203 million and $178 million, respectively, an increase of $25 million. This increase was due primarily to a higher depreciable base of assets resulting from additional assets placed in service in 2016. Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $178 million and $95 million, respectively, an increase of $83 million. This increase was primarily driven by the Merger and our acquisition of Gras Savoye.\nThe Company's accounting for the following law changes of U.S. Tax Reform is incomplete, and it is not yet able to make reasonable estimates of the effects.

As of December 31, 2017, no changes to valuation allowances have been recorded as a result of U.S. Tax Reform.\nThe BDA segment, formerly Exchange Solutions, provides primary medical and ancillary benefit exchange and outsourcing services to active employees and retirees across both the group and individual markets. A significant portion of the revenues in this segment is recurring in nature, driven by either the commissions from the policies we sell, or from long-term service contracts with our clients that typically range from three to five years. Revenues across this segment may be seasonal, driven by the magnitude and timing of client transition activities, and we typically increase our membership levels significantly effective January 1, after calendar year-end benefits elections.\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares repurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,797,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average price per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$140.19\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate repurchase cost (excluding broker costs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$532 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFree cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash used to purchase fixed assets and software for internal use and is used to evaluate our liquidity.\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2016 was $775 million. The primary drivers during the period were debt issuance of $2.0 billion, debt repayments of $1.9 billion, net payments on the revolving credit facility of $237 million, dividend payments of $199 million, and share repurchases of $396 million. The debt issuance of $2.0 billion was primarily the issuance of $450 million of senior notes due 2021, $550 million of senior notes due 2026, \u20ac540 million ($609 million) of senior notes due 2022 and a $400 million drawdown on the 1-year term loan facility. The debt repayments of $1.9 billion were primarily $300 million repayment of senior notes due 2016, $400 million repayment of Legacy Towers Watson debt and repayments of $592 million and $400 million on the 1-year term loan facility.\nThe table below presents segment commissions and fees and segment interest and other income for IRR for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\n h. Income taxes. Adjustments to record the income tax impact of the pro forma adjustments, including the removal of the tax consequences of the repatriation of foreign earnings to partially fund the pre-Merger special dividend. The income tax expense was calculated based on the U.S. and foreign statutory rates applicable to adjustments made. Where applicable, a U.S. statutory rate of 40% was used. Pro forma adjustments for income tax purposes have been determined without regard to potential tax planning strategies that may result from the Merger of Towers Watson with Willis. Tax benefits from the Merger have not been considered in our pro forma adjustments. \nA reconciliation of income from operations to adjusted operating income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the foreign currency impact resulted from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against a number of currencies, most significantly the Euro and the Pound sterling.\nBenefit Delivery and Administration\nTypically, our business benefits from regulatory change, political risk or economic uncertainty. Insurance broking generally tracks the economy, but demand for both insurance broking and consulting services usually remains steady during times of uncertainty. We have some businesses, such as our health and benefits and administration businesses, which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change.\n (i) The tax effect was calculated using an effective tax rate for each item.  Our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to revenue growth across all segments partially offset by higher salary and benefits costs. The prior year also included settlement income of \u00a328 million ($41 million) related to the Fine Arts, Jewellery and Specie team.\n\nThe table below presents segment commissions and fees, and segment interest and other income for IRR for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nBonus Depreciation - While the Company has not completed its determination of all capital expenditures that qualify for immediate expensing, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provisional tax deduction of $40 million based on its current intent to fully expense all qualifying expenditures. The Company will analyze the dates all capital expenditures were placed in service or acquired and consider any future guidance within the next twelve months to finalize the deduction. This resulted in an increase of approximately $14 million to the Company's U.S. federal current income taxes receivable and a corresponding increase in its net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $14 million.\nIn 2016, we began managing our business across four integrated reportable operating segments: Human Capital and Benefits; Corporate Risk and Broking; Investment, Risk and Reinsurance; and Benefits Delivery and Administration, formerly Exchange Solutions.\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $7.9 billion, compared to $7.5 billion pro forma revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $395 million, or 5%. This growth was driven by a 7% increase due to our acquisitions of Gras Savoye and Miller and 1% organic revenue growth, partially offset by adverse foreign currency exchange movements of 3%. The primary drivers of our growth were within our Corporate Risk and Broking and Benefits Delivery and\nWillis Towers Watson is a global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth.

We believe our unique perspective allows us to see the critical intersections between talent, assets and ideas - the dynamic formula that drives business performance.\n____________________\nCosts of Providing Services\nBDA generated approximately 9% of our segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. BDA provides services across four integrated or related offerings to customers primarily in the U.S. through four business units:\n \u2022 Insurance Consulting and Technology - Insurance Consulting and Technology, formerly Risk Consulting and Software, is a global business that provides advice and technology solutions to the insurance industry, as well as to corporate clients with respect to their insurance programs. Services include software and technology, risk and capital management, products and pricing, financial and regulatory reporting, financial and capital modeling, M&A, outsourcing and business management. \nGoodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, and the Company had nine reporting units as of October 1, 2017.\n \u2022 Max Matthiessen - Max Matthiessen is a leading advisor and broker within insurance, benefits, human resources and savings in the Nordic region. The business specializes in providing human capital and benefits administration together with providing market leading savings and insurance solutions. \nThe CRB segment provides a broad range of risk advice, insurance broking and consulting services to clients worldwide ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations. The segment delivers integrated global solutions tailored to client needs and underpinned by data and analytics.\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to $1.8 billion, from $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $147 million, or 9%. Income from operations increased by $187 million, largely due to revenue growth across all segments partially offset by higher salary and benefits costs. The prior year also included settlement income of \u00a328 million ($41 million) related to the Fine Arts, Jewellery and Specie team.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities or new debt offerings.\nA reconciliation of income from operations to adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows:\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe consider adjusted revenues to be an important financial measure, which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors.\n \u2022 Constant Currency Change - Represents the year over year change in revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. To calculate this impact, the prior year local currency results are first translated using the current year monthly average exchange rates. The change is calculated by comparing the prior year revenues, translated at the current year monthly average exchange rates, to the current year as reported revenues, for the same period. We believe constant currency measures provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to performance by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on period-over-period comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. \nRestructuring costs and Interest expense\n(i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.\nTo assist the reader in understanding our comparative analysis, we have included discussion and analysis of pro forma financial information for Willis Towers Watson as if the Towers Watson Merger had occurred on January 1, 2015.\n\nThe pro forma financial information for 2015 is only for Willis and Towers Watson and does not include Gras Savoye or other M&A activity on a pro forma basis.\nEvents that could change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include significant changes in operating results, potential future acquisitions or divestitures, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or regulatory matters, or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets.\nsettlement and curtailment activity, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, loss/(gain) on disposal of operations, tax effects of internal reorganizations and U.S. Tax Reform, and non-recurring items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results, divided by adjusted income before taxes. Adjusted income taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate.\n \u2022 Retirement - The Retirement business provides actuarial support, plan design, and administrative services for traditional pension and retirement savings plans. Our colleagues help our clients assess the costs and risks of retirement plans on cash flow, earnings and the balance sheet, the effects of changing workforce demographics on their retirement plans and retiree benefit adequacy and security. \nOperating Leases - We lease office space and furniture under operating lease agreements with terms typically ranging from three to twenty years. We have determined that there is not a large concentration of leases that will expire in any one fiscal year. Consequently, management anticipates that any increase in future rent expense on leases will be mainly market-driven. We also lease cars and selected computer equipment under operating lease agreements. For acquired operating leases, intangible assets or liabilities have been recognized for the difference between the contractual cash obligations and the estimated market rates at the time of acquisition. These intangibles are amortized to rent expense but do not affect our contractual cash obligations. See further discussion in Item 8, Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nValuation of Billed and Unbilled Receivables from Clients\nHCB commissions and fees, and total segment revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $3.2 billion, compared to $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Retirement revenues increased in Western Europe, International and Great Britain and were partially offset by a decline in North America. The decline in North America was expected as bulk lump sum projects declined year over year. Actuarial consulting projects in Great Britain were strong due to regulation changes. The growth in Talent & Rewards was flat. Healthcare consulting revenues in Health and Benefits were up significantly for all markets globally. North America grew due to increased consulting and product demand and Great Britain grew due to global benefits solutions implementations. Revenue in the Technology and Administration Solutions business in Great Britain experienced strong growth as a result of new administration clients and project activity.\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\n \u2022 Provision for Stanford and other significant litigation - The 2016 provision for the Stanford litigation matter, which we consider to be a non-ordinary course litigation matter. We will also include other litigation matters which we believe are not representative of our core business operations. \nBusiness Strategy\nRestructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $132 million, all of which related to the final year of the Operational Improvement Program (\u2018OIP'). Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $193 million, of which $145 million related to the OIP and $48 million related to the Business Restructuring Program. Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $126 million, all of which was related to the OIP. See our discussion in the Operational Improvement Program and Business Restructuring Program section herein and Note 5 - Restructuring Costs within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details about these expenses.\n_____________________\n\nExecutive Overview\nOther operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1.6 billion, compared to $1.4 billion for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $105 million or 7%. The increase was primarily related to our acquisitions of Gras Savoye and Miller, which contributed approximately $135 million of the increase. In 2016, we accrued $50 million for the Stanford litigation, which was $20 million less than the $70 million accrued in 2015.\n \u2022 Wholesale Insurance Broking - Wholesale Insurance Broking provides wholesale and specialist broking services to retail brokers. \nShare Repurchase Program\nReduction of the federal corporate tax rate - Beginning January 1, 2018, the Company's U.S. income will be taxed at a 21% federal corporate tax rate. Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recalculated as of the enactment date using current tax laws and rates expected to be in effect when the deferred tax items reverse in future periods, which is 21%. Consequently, the Company has recorded a provisional decrease in its net deferred tax liabilities of $208 million, with a corresponding deferred income tax benefit of $208 million. While the Company is able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, it may be affected by other analyses related to U.S. Tax Reform that could result in other adjustments to U.S. federal deferred tax balances, including analysis of tax amounts in other comprehensive income and any future guidance issued.\n\nOperational Improvement Program\nThis discussion includes forward-looking statements. See \u2018Disclaimer Regarding Forward-looking Statements' for certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and \u2018Risk Factors' in Item 1A for a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in those statements.\n \u2022 Leveraging our combined distribution strength and global footprint to enhance market penetration and provide a platform for further innovation; and \n \u2022 Investment - Investment provides advice to improve investment outcomes for asset owners using a broad and sophisticated framework for managing risk. \nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $551 million, compared to $765 million for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $214 million. The decrease was primarily due to increases in transaction and integration expenses of $147 million and restructuring costs of $67 million.\n\nTax Related Liabilities -\nWe have included the reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues in the table below, together with our reconciliation of the pro forma revenues change to the constant currency and organic changes.\nThe pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2015 combines: (i) the historical consolidated statement of operations of Willis Towers Watson for the year ended December 31, 2015 and (ii) the historical consolidated statement of operations of Towers Watson for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 less the historical consolidated statement of operations of Towers Watson for the six months ended December 31, 2014, plus the historical consolidated statement of operations of Towers Watson for the six months ended December 31, 2015.\n g. Interest Expense. Net adjustments to interest expense include additional interest and amortization of related deferred debt issuance costs. Approximately $13 million incremental interest expense was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to a borrowing under a $340 million term loan as part of the funding for the pre-Merger special dividend on December 29, 2015 and the portion of the senior notes issuance used to repay Towers Watson's existing debt at the time of the Merger. \nThe pro forma financial information is only for Willis and Towers Watson and does not include Gras Savoye or other merger or acquisition activity on a pro forma basis.\nWillis Towers Watson Plan - Substantially all U.S. employees are eligible to participate in this plan. Benefits are provided under a stable value pension plan design. The original stable value design came into effect on January 1, 2012. As of July 1, 2017, existing plan participants earn benefits without having to make employee contributions, and all newly eligible employees are required to contribute 2% of pay to participate in the plan.\nA reconciliation of net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\n\nAlthough approximately 22% of our revenues are generated in the U.K. on an annual basis, only about 13% of revenues are denominated in Pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in U.S. dollars. Approximately 19% of our expenses are denominated in Pounds sterling, thus we generally benefit from a weakening Pound sterling in our income from operations. However, we have a Company hedging strategy for this aspect of our business, which is designed to mitigate significant fluctuations in currency.\nBDA total segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $729 million and $654 million, respectively. Individual Marketplace revenues increased by 10%, and the rest of the segment grew by 14%, led by Group Marketplace and Benefits Outsourcing. Growth in the Individual and Group Marketplaces resulted from the additional 2017 enrollments, and Benefits Outsourcing's growth was a result of new client wins and special projects.\nAn estimated annual bonus amount is initially developed at the beginning of each fiscal year in conjunction with our budgeting process. Estimated annual operating performance is reviewed quarterly and the discretionary annual bonus amount is then adjusted, if necessary, by management to reflect changes in the forecast of pre-bonus profitability for the year.\nThe Company has no material commitments for capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures for fixed assets and software for internal use were $300 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Expected capital expenditures for fixed assets and software for internal use are approximately $285 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect cash from operations to adequately provide for these cash needs.\nAn analysis of cumulative restructuring costs recognized for the Operational Improvement Program from its commencement through the year ended December 31, 2017 by segment is as follows:\nOther operating expenses include occupancy, legal, marketing, licenses, royalties, supplies, technology, printing and telephone costs, as well as insurance, including premiums on excess insurance and losses on professional liability claims, non-client-reimbursed travel by colleagues, publications, professional subscriptions and development, recruitment, other professional fees and irrecoverable value added and sales taxes.\nThe table below details our revenues and expenses by transactional currency for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n \u2022 Delivering a powerful client proposition with an integrated global platform. Our combined offerings provide comprehensive advice, analytics, specialty capabilities and solutions covering benefits, benefits delivery solutions, brokerage and advisory, risk and capital management, and talent and rewards; \nAs an insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best means of managing risk and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network. We operate the largest private Medicare exchange in the U.S. Through this exchange and those for active employees, we help our clients move to a more sustainable economic model by capping and controlling the costs associated with healthcare benefits.\nEconomic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.\n____________________\nOther Operating Expenses\nWe are not an insurance company, and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account.\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nReconciliations of income from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates to adjusted income before taxes and provision for/(benefit from) income taxes to adjusted income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\namortization. See Item 8, Note 3 - Merger, Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 8 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\nAdjusted revenues is defined as total revenues adjusted for the fair value adjustment for deferred revenues that would otherwise have been recognized but for the purchase accounting treatment of these transactions. U.S. GAAP accounting requires the elimination of this revenue.\n\nHCB total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $3.1 billion, compared to $584 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $2.5 billion or 434%. This growth in revenues was driven by our Merger and our acquisition of Gras Savoye. See the \u2018Supplementary Pro Forma Segment Revenues' section below for additional discussion of our 2016 results.\nIn May 2017, we completed an offering of $650 million of 3.600% senior notes due 2024. Net proceeds of $644 million were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nSupplementary Pro Forma Segment Revenues\nAdjusted operating income is defined as income from operations adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, significant litigation settlements, significant pension settlement and curtailment activity, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue and non-recurring items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results.\n\n \u2022 Pension settlement and curtailment gains and losses - Adjustment to remove significant pension settlement and curtailment gains and losses to better present how the Company is performing. \n k.

Consolidated Revenues\nPro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations\nRestructuring Costs\n \u2022 Gains and losses on disposals of operations - Adjustment to remove the gain or loss resulting from disposed operations. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, there was a $96 million benefit from income taxes, due primarily to a benefit from the release of a portion of our U.S. valuation allowances and shifts in the global mix of income as a result of the Merger. This shift creates additional deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates, which reduces the global effective tax rate. For the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015, there was a provision for income taxes of $70 million. Legacy Willis had a benefit from income taxes due to the release of a portion of U.S. valuation allowances in 2015 which was more than offset by the provision for income taxes for Legacy Towers Watson.\nIn April 2014, Legacy Willis announced a multi-year operational improvement program designed to strengthen its client service capabilities and deliver future cost savings. The main elements of the program, which was completed during 2017, included: moving more than 3,500 support roles from higher cost locations to facilities in lower cost locations; net workforce reductions in support positions; lease consolidation in real estate; and information technology systems simplification and rationalization.\nThe table below sets forth our summarized consolidated statements of comprehensive income and data as a percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nOther Expense/(Income), Net\nOur shares are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n(i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.\nThe Company believes that these measures are relevant and provide useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry to provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing our operating performance, and in the case of free cash flow, our liquidity results.\nAt December 31, 2017, our material mandatory debt repayments over the next twelve months consist of scheduled repayments of $85 million on our term loan maturing in 2019.\nCash flows from investing activities for 2016 were $195 million, largely driven by $476 million of cash acquired as a result of our Merger with Towers Watson, which was a non-cash transaction as it was consummated through the issuance of shares. Cash inflows were partially offset by $303 million of fixed assets and software for internal use and capitalized costs of developing software.\nAdjusted income before taxes is defined as income from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, significant litigation settlements, significant pension settlement and curtailment activity, the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue, (gain)/loss on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted income before taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate.\nIncome from Operations\nThe IRR segment uses a sophisticated approach to risk, which helps clients free up capital and manage investment complexity. The segment works closely with investors, reinsurers and insurers to manage the equation between risk and return. Blending advanced analytics with deep institutional knowledge, IRR identifies new opportunities to maximize performance. IRR provides investment consulting services and insurance specific services and solutions through reserves opinions, software, ratemaking, usage-based insurance, risk underwriting and reinsurance broking.\nOur revenues can be materially impacted by changes in currency conversions, which can fluctuate significantly over the course of a calendar year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, currency translation decreased our consolidated revenues by $27 million. The decrease was driven primarily by a weaker Pound sterling during the first half of the year, partially offset by increases in the Pound sterling, Euro, the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar in the second half of the year.\nDepreciation\nOur compensation program includes a discretionary bonus that is determined by management and has historically been paid once per fiscal year in the form of cash and/or deferred stock units after our annual operating results are finalized.\nTransaction and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $269 million, which consists of costs associated with our information technology and finance initiatives and rationalization, property consolidation, benefits harmonization and costs associated with the settlement of the Merger-related appraisal demand lawsuit (see Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Transaction and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $177 million. Approximately $162 million of these expenses were related to the Merger and $15 million were related to the acquisition of Gras Savoye. Transaction and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $84 million. Approximately $58 million of these expenses were related to the Merger, $15 million were related to the acquisition of Gras Savoye and $11 million were related to our acquisition of Miller.\nCorporate Risk and Broking\nThe following table presents the summarized consolidated cash flow information for the years ended:\nDescriptions of our U.S. and U.K. plans, which comprise 91% of our projected benefit obligations and 93% of our plan assets, are below:\n (i) Includes pro forma adjustments made in the Supplementary Pro Forma Financial Information section in this Form 10-K.  Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.6 billion, compared to pro forma $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $109 million. The increase in adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by our acquisition of Gras Savoye, the settlement with JLT of \u00a328 million ($41 million) related to the Fine Art, Jewellery and Specie team, and the performance of our Benefits Delivery and Administration segment.\nBenefit from Income Taxes\nDepreciation\n \u25e6 The Company has adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach on January 1, 2018, and has applied the new standard only to contracts that are not completed as of the transition date. \nCash Flows (Used In)/From Investing Activities\nWe offer clients a broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks, and to enhance business performance by improving their ability to attract, retain and engage a talented workforce. Our risk control services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial analysis), to a variety of due diligence services, to the provision of practical on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss control consulting), as well as analytical and advisory services (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies). We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they occur. These services include contingency planning, security audits and product tampering plans. We help our clients enhance their business performance by delivering consulting services, technology and solutions that help organizations anticipate, identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities in human capital management as well as investment advice to help our clients develop disciplined and efficient strategies to meet their investment goals.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\nAdjusted net income is defined as net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, significant litigation settlements, significant pension settlement and curtailment activity, the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue, loss/(gain) on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and the related tax effect of those adjustments, the tax effects of internal reorganizations and U.S. Tax Reform. This measure is used solely for the purpose of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share.\n \u25e6 The majority of our leases are currently considered operating leases and will be capitalized as a lease asset on our balance sheets with a related lease liability for the obligated lease payments when the ASU is adopted. The ASU becomes effective for the Company at the beginning of the 2019 fiscal year; early adoption is permitted. \nexpenses were related to the Merger and $15 million were related to the integration of Gras Savoye. For the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015, transaction expenses related to the Merger of $151 million have been eliminated as part of the pro forma adjustments. Of the remaining $30 million of transaction and integration expenses, approximately $15 million were related to Gras Savoye, $11 million were related to Miller, and $4 million were related to other miscellaneous M&A activity.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, the Company performed Step 1 of the two-step impairment test for all reporting units. Each of the reporting units' estimated fair values were in excess of their carrying values. To perform the test, we used valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit that fall under income or market approaches. Under the discounted cash flow method, an income approach, the business enterprise value is determined by discounting to present value the terminal value which is calculated using debt-free after-tax cash flows for a finite period of years. Key estimates in this approach were internal financial projection estimates prepared by management, business risk, and expected rates of return on capital. The guideline company method, a market approach, develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publicly traded companies. Key estimates and selection of valuation multiples rely on the selection of similar companies, obtaining estimates of forecast revenues and EBITDA estimates for the similar companies and selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics. Under the similar transactions method, a market approach, actual transaction prices and operating data from companies deemed reasonably similar to the reporting units is used to develop valuation multiples as an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for the business units.\nThe following table sets out the components of IRR revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the pro forma prior year.\nFunding is based on actuarially determined contributions and is limited to amounts that are currently deductible for tax purposes, or as agreed to with the plan trustees for the U.K. plans. Since funding calculations are based on different measurements than those used for accounting purposes, pension contributions are not equal to net periodic benefit cost.\n \u2022 Tax effect of U.S.Tax Reform - Relates to the (1) U.S. income tax adjustment of deferred taxes upon the change in the federal corporate tax rate, (2) the impact of the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits, and (3) the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liabilities associated with the U.S. tax on certain foreign earnings offset with a write-off of deferred tax assets that will no longer be realizable under U.S. Tax Reform. \nOther expense/(income), net, includes other gains and losses, including gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other expense/(income), net for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was expense of $61 million and $27 million, respectively, which were primarily foreign currency transaction losses. Other expense/(income), net for the year ended\nIn March 2017, we entered into a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility replacing our previous $800 million revolving credit facility. Borrowings against the $1.25 billion facility of $409 million and \u20ac45 million were used to repay all outstanding borrowings against the $800 million facility and the 7-year term loan due July 23, 2018.\nSupplementary Pro Forma Financial Information\nOther Operating Expenses\nDefinitions of Constant Currency Change and Organic Change are included in the section entitled \u2018Non-GAAP Financial Measures' in this Form 10-K.\nAdditionally, at December 31, 2017, $362 million was available to draw against our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility as compared to $557 million, which was available to draw against our previous $800 million revolving credit facility at December 31, 2016.\nCRB commissions and fees, and total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $2.6 billion, compared to $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. All regions contributed to the strong revenue growth led by International followed by Western Europe, North America and Great Britain. International's growth was fueled by excellent client retention and strong new business. Western Europe, North America and Great Britain experienced good client retention and solid new business growth.\nThe impact of acquisitions and divestitures did not have a significant impact on the change in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 since most of these transactions happened in the latter part of the year. Prospectively, our 2018 revenues will exclude a net $65 million related to the impact of various acquisitions and divestitures initiated or completed in 2017.\n\n(Benefit from)/Provision for Income Taxes\nCash flows from operating activities for 2015 was $244 million, which included net income of $384 million, adjusted for $38 million of non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to cash used in operating activities, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $178 million.\nTransaction and integration expenses\n \u2022 Uncertain Tax Positions - The table above does not include liabilities for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, Income Taxes. The settlement period for the $59 million liability, which excludes interest and penalties, cannot be reasonably estimated since it depends on the timing and possible outcomes of tax examinations with various tax authorities. \nThe following table sets out the total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the components of the change in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year:\n \u2022 Technology and Administration Solutions - Our Technology and Administration Solutions (\u2018TAS') business provides benefits outsourcing services to clients outside of the U.S.  The table below presents segment commissions and fees and segment interest and other income for HCB for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe table below presents segment commissions and fees and segment interest and other income for HCB for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\n____________________\nDividends\nOn April 20, 2016, the Willis Towers Watson board reconfirmed, reapproved and reauthorized the remaining portion of the Legacy Willis program to repurchase the Company's ordinary shares on the open market or by way of redemption or otherwise.\nConstant Currency Change and Organic Change\nTotal costs of providing services were $7.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $128 million, or 2%. Total costs of providing services were $7.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $3.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $3.9 billion. See the analysis below for further information.\nThe Company is expecting to deliver $325 million of annual cost savings beginning in 2018. To achieve these savings, it has incurred cumulative restructuring charges of $441 million for the program since it began in the second quarter of 2014.\nIf the Company was required to perform Step 2, we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit used in Step 1 to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including any recognized or unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then the implied fair value of goodwill would be compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine if goodwill is impaired. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not record any impairment losses of goodwill or intangibles.\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, except per share data)\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as U.S. Tax Reform. U.S. Tax Reform makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to: (1) requiring a one-time transition tax on certain unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that may be payable over eight years; (2) bonus depreciation that will allow for a full expensing of qualified property; (3) reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; (4) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (\u2018GILTI'), which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits (\u2018FTCs') and a deduction of up to 50% to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (5) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (6) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (7) limitations on the use of FTCs to reduce the U.S. income tax liability; (8) the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax (\u2018BEAT'), a new minimum tax; and (9) a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries.\nBeginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affect our segment results. These changes, which are detailed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017, include the realignment of certain businesses within our segments, as well as changes to certain allocation methodologies to better reflect the ongoing nature of our businesses. The prior period comparatives reflected in the tables below have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. See Note 4 - Segment Information within Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of these changes.\n \u25e6 continuing to modernize the way we run our business to better serve our clients, enable the skills of our staff, and lower our costs of doing business; \nThe determination of the Company's obligations and annual expense under the plans is based on a number of assumptions that, given the longevity of the plans, are long-term in focus. A change in one or a combination of these assumptions could have a material impact on our projected benefit obligation. However, certain of these changes, such as changes in the discount rates and other actuarial assumptions, are not recognized immediately in net income, but are instead recorded in other comprehensive income. The accumulated gains and losses not yet recognized in net income are amortized into net income as a component of the net periodic benefit cost/(credit) based on the average working life expectancy of each of the plan's active participants to the extent that the net gains or losses as of the beginning of the year exceed 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation.\nCRB total segment and commissions and fees revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $2.5 billion, compared to pro forma $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. The growth for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to the acquisition of Gras Savoye, which occurred on December 29, 2015. International organic revenue declined as a result of lower revenues in Asia and Australasia, partially offset by better performance in Latin America and CEEMEA. Offsetting the International decline was Great Britain's organic growth as a result of solid revenue increases across all lines of business. Western Europe contributed to organic growth with strong revenue gains in Iberia, partially offset by softness in Italy. North America was flat with strong retention offset by lower new business.\n(ii) We have not presented this measure on a comparative basis with 2015 because it is not practical to present the 2015 adjusted income tax rate on a pro forma basis, as making tax-effected non-GAAP adjustments on a proforma basis would be highly speculative in nature.\nOther operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, a decrease of $17 million. The decrease was due primarily to the Stanford litigation provision of $50 million in 2016, partially offset by reserves for the City of Houston and CalPERS litigations and increases in other litigation reserves and professional services in 2017. Other operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $1.6 billion and $718 million, respectively, an increase of $833 million. The increase was primarily driven by the Merger and our acquisition of Gras Savoye.\nPension Assumptions\nNet income attributable to Willis Towers Watson\n\nExecutive Summary\nCommitments, Contingencies and Accrued Liabilities\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nAt December 31, 2017, there are no material elements of U.S. Tax Reform for which the Company's accounting is complete. While the Company's accounting for the following elements of U.S. Tax Reform is incomplete, the Company was able to make reasonable estimates of certain effects. Accordingly, the Company recorded provisional adjustments for the following significant items:\nSee Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussions of risks that may affect our ability to compete.\n b. Conforming reclassifications and adjustments. Certain reclassifications have been made to amounts in the Towers Watson historical statement of operations to conform to Willis' presentation, including reclassifying certain contra revenue accounts and Towers Watson's professional and subcontracted services, occupancy and general and administrative expenses within the relevant Willis captions. \nThe Company is authorized to repurchase shares, by way of redemption, and will consider whether to do so from time to time, based on many factors, including market conditions.\nAmortization\nCash flows from operating activities were $862 million for 2017, compared to cash flows from operating activities of $933 million for 2016. The $862 million net cash from operating activities for 2017 included net income of $592 million, adjusted for $548 million of non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $278 million. The $548 million non-cash adjustments primarily include depreciation, amortization, and the benefit from deferred income taxes. The $71 million decrease in cash from operations in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily resulted from changes in working capital and higher discretionary compensation payments made in 2017 for the 2016 compensation cycle. These discretionary compensation payments were lower in 2016 because they included only a partial payment to Legacy Towers Watson colleagues due to the timing of the Merger.\nto measure deferred tax assets at the amount considered realizable in future periods if the Company's facts and assumptions change. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and the results of recent financial operations. We place more reliance on evidence that is objectively verifiable.\nInvestment, Risk and Reinsurance (\u2018IRR')\nAs Reported Segment Revenues\nContractual Obligations\nIn order to assist readers of our consolidated financial statements in understanding the core operating results that Willis Towers Watson's management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning purposes, we present the following non-GAAP measures and their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure:\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nA reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and a reconciliation of the reported change to the constant currency and organic changes for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the prior year is as follows:\n____________________\n____________________\nIndefinite reinvestment assertion - Beginning in 2018, U.S. Tax Reform provides a 100% deduction for dividends received from 10-percent owned foreign corporations by U.S. corporate shareholders, subject to a one-year holding period. Although dividend income is now exempt from U.S. federal tax for U.S. corporate shareholders, companies must still account for the tax consequences of outside basis differences and other tax impacts of their investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. As a result of U.S. Tax Reform we have analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a repatriation and have determined that we may repatriate up to $219 million, the majority of which was previously deemed indefinitely reinvested. For those investments from which we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of such repatriation, we have recorded a provisional estimate for foreign withholding and state income taxes of $1 million. In addition, we re-measured the existing deferred tax liability accrued on certain acquired Towers Watson subsidiaries and released the deferred tax liability relating to the outside basis difference. This resulted in an income tax benefit of $76 million as these foreign earnings were subject to the one-time transition tax which reduced the outside basis difference.\nIn applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, with the remainder recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of October 1, and whenever indicators of impairment arise. The fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of October 1, and whenever indicators of impairment arise.\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $738 million compared to $551 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $187 million, or 34%. This increase resulted primarily from additional revenue of $315 million driven by growth across all segments, partially offset by additional costs resulting primarily from our integration activities and additional salary and benefits costs. Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $551 million compared to $427 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $124 million or 29%. The growth in income from operations compared to that of 2015 was primarily driven by the Merger and our acquisition of Gras Savoye.\nAdjusted Revenues\n \u2022 Talent & Rewards - Our Talent & Rewards (\u2018T&R') business provides advice, data, software and products to address clients' total rewards and talent issues. \nThis discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u2018SEC'). We present such non-GAAP financial measures, specifically, adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Company's operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent under U.S. GAAP, and these provide a measure against which our businesses may be assessed in the future.\nLegacy Miller - The plan provides retirement benefits based on members' salaries at the point at which they ceased to accrue benefits under the scheme.\n e. Depreciation. Adjustment related to depreciation on internally developed software of $57 million partially offset by an increase of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in the estimated fair value for leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and computer hardware and software. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nA reconciliation of net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nSee \u2018Non-GAAP Financial Measures' below for further discussion of our adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures.\nIncome from Operations\nIncome Taxes\nThere are no expiration dates for these repurchase plans or programs. The following table presents specified information about the Company's repurchases of ordinary shares for the year ended December 31, 2017:\nNet cash from financing activities in 2015 was $640 million, primarily due to $469 million net drawings on the revolving credit facility, a $592 million term loan draw down to fund the acquisition of Gras Savoye, and the issuance of shares of $131 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $277 million and repurchase of shares of $82 million.\n____________________\n\n \u2022 Benefits Accounts (formerly Consumer-Directed Accounts) - This business uses its SaaS-based technology and related services to deliver consumer-driven healthcare and reimbursement accounts, including health savings accounts, health reimbursement arrangements and other consumer-directed accounts.

Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds.\nThe following table sets out the total revenues generated for the year ended December 31, 2016, pro forma revenues generated for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the components of the change for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the pro forma prior year.\nSee the \u2018Supplementary Pro Forma Segment Revenues' section below for additional discussion of our 2016 results.\nCash flows used in financing activities for 2017 were $479 million. The significant financing activities included the payment of $177 million related to the cancellation of Towers Watson shares in connection with the settlement of the Merger-related appraisal demand lawsuit (consisting of the portion of the settlement equal to the value of consideration that would have been\nTransaction and integration expenses were $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $147 million compared to $30 million for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately $162 million of these\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the following adjustments:\nmanagement and changed when appropriate. A discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved, whereas the expected long-term return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long term target asset allocations are revised. To calculate the discount rate, we use the granular approach to determining service cost and interest cost. We began using this method to calculate the discount rate in 2016. This was treated as a change in accounting estimate, and resulted in a credit of $51 million included in our total net periodic benefit income. The expected rate of return assumptions for all plans are supported by an analysis of the weighted-average yield expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments. Other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality, and the expected long-term rate of compensation and pension increases.\n\nIRR commissions and fees and total segment revenues for both years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $1.5 billion. Total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 included \u00a328 million ($41 million) received for a settlement related to the Fine Arts, Jewellery and Specie Team. Wholesale Insurance Broking, Investment, Insurance Consulting and Technology, Max Matthiessen and Willis Re all posted commissions and fees revenue growth, primarily as a result of strong sales and increased performance fees. Willis Towers Watson Securities growth was flat. The reduction in Portfolio and Underwriting Services commissions and fees was driven by a loss of profit commissions following the Atlantic hurricanes, the cancellation of a key contract, and the divestiture of small programs in the portfolio.\nSalaries and Benefits\n(i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.\n \u25e6 Revenue recognition for certain other revenue streams has changed from recognizing revenue at a point in time to recognizing revenue over time. Specifically, certain arrangements in our Health and Benefits broking business will now be recognized evenly over the year to reflect the nature of the ongoing obligations to our customers as well as receipt of the monthly commissions. These contracts are monthly or annual in nature and are considered complete as of the transition date. Therefore, no retained earnings adjustment is required. \nSalaries and Benefits\n i. Willis ordinary shares issuance. Approximately 184 million Willis ordinary shares (prior to the reverse stock split) were issued to Towers Watson stockholders as the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger, based on Towers Watson shares of common stock outstanding as of January 4, 2016, at a per share price of $47.18, which was the closing share price on that date, for a total value of approximately $8.7 billion. \nThe following table sets out the components of BDA revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the pro forma prior year.\nCash flows from operating activities were $933 million for 2016, compared to cash flows of from operating activities of $244 million for 2015. The $933 million net cash from operating activities for 2016 included net income of $438 million, adjusted for $590 million of non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $95 million. The $590 million of non-cash adjustments primarily include depreciation, amortization, net defined benefit pension credits, share-based compensation, and the benefit from deferred income taxes. The $689 million increase in cash from operations in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to cash from operations from Legacy Towers Watson and Gras Savoye.\nWillis Towers Watson sees that a unified approach to people and risk can be a path to growth for our clients.

As a result, and due to the global and diverse nature of our business, we view rates in the aggregate.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) adjusted for provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, significant litigation settlements, significant pension settlement and curtailment activity, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, loss/(gain) on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results.\n d. Rent. Adjustment to eliminate $5 million of historical rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 offset by $1 million amortization of our favorable and unfavorable lease agreements. \n (ii) We have not presented this measure on a comparative pro forma basis because it is not practical to present the 2015 adjusted income tax effects on a pro forma basis, as making tax-effected non-GAAP adjustments on a proforma basis would be highly speculative in nature.  Adjusted Income Before Taxes and Adjusted Income Taxes/Tax Rate\n\nIncluded within cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are amounts held for regulatory capital adequacy requirements, including $90 million and $87 million, respectively, held within our regulated U.K. entities.\nRestructuring Programs\n \u2022 Underpinning this growth through continuous operational improvement initiatives that help make us more effective and efficient and drive cost synergies. We do this by: \nHCB total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3.1 billion; commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $3.1 billion, compared with pro forma $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing an increase of $63 million to total segment revenues and an increase of $62 million to commissions and fees. Pro forma and constant currency revenue growth were driven by the acquisition of Gras Savoye, which occurred on December 29, 2015. In an effort to align resources and market demand, a significant restructuring across all lines of business took place during the second half of 2016, which caused disruption in our billable hours. Across the segment, performance was mixed, resulting in flat organic growth. Retirement revenues declined slightly as a result of reduced actuarial consulting, primarily in the fourth quarter. The Health and Benefits North America consulting business continued to see demand for plan design projects and increased product revenue. The Talent and Rewards advisory business was down period-over-period as the M&A market softened. The Technology and Administration Solutions Great Britain business had strong performance, led by increased project and administration activity along with new clients. Internationally, Global Wealth Solutions has been negatively impacted by adverse conditions in the Greater China market.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.9 billion, compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $130 million, or 7%. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was largely due to revenue growth across all segments partially offset by higher salary and benefits costs. The prior year also included settlement income of \u00a328 million ($41 million) related to the Fine Arts, Jewellery and Specie team.\nUnited States\n____________________\nNet income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $568 million, an increase of $148 million compared to $420 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by an improvement of $187 million in income from operations partially offset by a $34 million increase to expense in other expense/(income), net. Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $420 million, an increase of $47 million compared to $373 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The growth was primarily driven by an improvement of $124 million in income from operations and an increase of $63 million in the benefit from income taxes, partially offset by a $42 million increase in interest expense and an $82 million increase to expense in other expense/(income), net.\nWe are continuing our integration of Legacy Willis and Legacy Towers Watson, creating a unified platform for global growth, including positioning the Company to leverage our mutual distribution strength to enhance market penetration, expand our global footprint and create a strong platform for further innovation.\ntime transition tax liability for its foreign subsidiaries owned by U.S. corporate shareholders, resulting in an increase in U.S. federal income tax expense of $70 million and state income tax expense of $2 million. The Company has a significant number of foreign subsidiaries and therefore has not yet completed its calculation of the total post-1986 E&P as well as non-U.S. income taxes paid for these foreign subsidiaries. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets, including trade receivables based on estimates. The Company expects to revise its estimates of E&P, non-U.S. income taxes and cash balances throughout 2018 when actual results are available. In addition, guidance may be released which could also impact these estimates.\nAs an intermediary, we hold funds, generally in a fiduciary capacity, for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from, clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both Fiduciary assets and Fiduciary liabilities on our balance sheets.\nManagement has considered the U.K. referendum vote on June 23, 2016 to depart from the E.U., the triggering of Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon (providing the right to and procedures for a member to leave the E.U.) on March 29, 2017, the early general election held on June 8, 2017, and the uncertainties about the near-term and longer-term effects of Brexit on the Company. The terms of Brexit, and its impact, are highly uncertain. For a further discussion of the risks of Brexit to the Company, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 Benefits Outsourcing (formerly Technology and Administration Solutions) - Through our proprietary BenefitConnect technology, this business provides a broad suite of health and welfare outsourcing services as well as decision support and modeling tools for pension users within the U.S. \n \u2022 Health and Benefits - The Health & Benefits (\u2018H&B') business provides plan management consulting, broking and administration across the full spectrum of health and group benefit programs, including medical, dental, disability, life and other coverage. \n \u2022 Property and Casualty - Property and Casualty provides property and liability insurance brokerage services across a wide range of industries including construction, real estate, healthcare, and natural resources. \nThe organic change presented above includes the reduction to revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue made during purchase accounting for the Merger. If this revenue had not been reduced, the constant currency change would have been an increase of 9% and the organic change would have been an increase of 2%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIndebtedness\nOur cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 totaled $1.0 billion, compared to $870 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in cash from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the strengthening of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly the Pound sterling and Euro and less net debt payments made in the current year.\nIn addition to the shares reported in the table above, the Company canceled 1,415,199 Towers Watson common shares at issue in the settlement of the Merger-related appraisal demand lawsuit (see Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies located within Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information) and an equivalent number of ordinary shares represented in the Company's issued and outstanding share count up until the settlement date. As a result, the litigation settlement and related share cancellation had a similar impact to a share repurchase in that it reduced the number of outstanding shares of the Company. However, it did not impact the remaining authority under the share repurchase program.\nPro Forma Adjustments\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets - Impairment Review\n j. Earnings per share. The pro forma consolidated basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 are calculated as follows: \nThe following table details our top five markets based on percentage of consolidated revenues (in U.S. dollars) from the countries where work is performed for the year ended December 31, 2017. These figures do not represent the currency of the related revenue, which is presented in the table below.\nWe consider adjusted EBITDA to be an important financial measure, which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations, to benchmark our operating results against our competitors, and to evaluate and measure our performance-based compensation plans.\n \u2022 Gain on re-measurement of equity interests - The Company recognized a gain as a result of re-measuring its prior equity interest in Gras Savoye held before the business combination in 2015.  These non-GAAP measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the information contained within our consolidated financial statements.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.8 billion, compared to pro forma $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $89 million. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by our acquisition of Gras Savoye, the settlement with JLT of \u00a328 million ($41 million) related to the Fine Art, Jewellery and Specie team, and the performance of our Benefits Delivery and Administration segment.\nCRB total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $2.5 billion, compared to $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $198 million or 8%. The growth for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of Gras Savoye, which occurred on December 29, 2015. Great Britain led organic growth with solid revenue increases across all lines of business. Western Europe contributed to organic growth with strong growth in Iberia, partially offset by softness in Italy. North America was flat with strong retention offset by lower new business. International organic revenue declined as a result of lower revenues in Asia and Australasia, partially offset by better performance in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (\u2018CEEMEA').\nLegacy Towers Watson - Benefit accruals earned under the Legacy Watson Wyatt defined benefit plan (predominantly pension benefits) ceased on February 28, 2015, although benefits earned prior to January 1, 2008 retain a link to salary until the employee leaves the Company. Benefit accruals earned under the legacy Towers Perrin defined benefit plan (predominantly lump sum benefits) were frozen on March 31, 2008. All participants now accrue defined contribution benefits.\n (i) These percentages exclude certain expenses for significant items which will not be settled in cash, or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations. These items include Merger-related amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs, and transaction and integration expenses.  The following table sets forth the total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the components of the change in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year:\nThe HCB segment provides services through four business units:\n____________________\nA reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma 2015, and a reconciliation of the pro forma change to the constant currency and organic changes for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the prior year is as follows:\n\n\nPlease see the discussion in the \u2018As Reported Consolidated Financial Information' section above.\ndue to the shareholders at the closing of the Merger if they had exchanged their shares; see Part II, Item 8. Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings for additional information), share repurchases of $532 million and dividend payments of $277 million, which were partially offset by net borrowings of $580 million.\nOther expense/(income), net, includes other gains and losses, including gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other expense/(income), net, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $27 million of net expense, which was primarily foreign currency transaction losses. Other expense/(income), net for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015 was $112 million of net income, which was primarily due to $80 million of gains on disposals of operations and $59 million in the gain on the re-measurement of equity interests, partially offset by $30 million in foreign currency transaction losses in 2015.\n \u25e6 Additionally, the revenue recognition for proportional treaty broking commissions has moved from recognition upon the receipt of the monthly or quarterly statements, to the recognition of an estimate of expected commissions upon the policy effective date. Since the majority of revenue recognized historically based on these monthly or quarterly statements was received over a two-year period, we will reflect an adjustment to retained earnings at the adoption date for the portion of revenue that would otherwise have been recognized during our 2018 calendar year related to policies effective in 2017 or prior. \nAs Reported Consolidated Financial Information\nDiscretionary Compensation\n\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, diluted. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors.\n \u2022 Transition Tax - The table above excludes a $72 million provisional transition tax payable resulting from U.S. Tax Reform. The Company can and will elect to pay this one-time tax liability over an eight-year period without interest. The one-time transition tax cannot be reasonably estimated because the Company has a significant number of foreign subsidiaries and therefore has not yet completed its calculation of the total post-1986 E&P as well as non-U.S. income taxes paid for these foreign subsidiaries. The Company expects to revise its estimates throughout 2018 when actual results become available. Future guidance may be released which could also impact these estimates. \n(i) Includes pro forma adjustments made in the Supplementary Pro Forma Financial Information section in this Form 10-K.\n \u25e6 Certain revenue streams have accelerated revenue recognition timing. In particular, the revenue recognition for our Individual Marketplace (formerly Retiree & Access Exchanges) has moved from monthly ratable recognition over the policy period, to the recognition upon placement of the policy. Consequently, the Company will now recognize the majority of one calendar year of expected commissions during its fourth quarter of the preceding calendar year. Therefore, at the adoption date, we have reflected an adjustment to retained earnings for the portion of the revenue that would otherwise have been recognized during our 2018 calendar year since our earnings process was largely completed during the fourth quarter of 2017. \nGILTI - U.S. Tax Reform creates a new requirement that certain income (i.e., GILTI) earned by controlled foreign corporations (\u2018CFCs') must be included currently in the gross income of the CFCs' U.S. shareholder. GILTI is the excess of the shareholder's \u2018net CFC tested income' over the net deemed tangible income return, which is currently defined as the excess of (1) 10 percent of the aggregate of the U.S. shareholder's pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder over (2) the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net CFC-tested income. Because of the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, the Company is continuing to evaluate this provision of U.S. Tax Reform and the application of ASC 740. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the \u2018period cost method') or (2) factoring such amounts into a company's measurement of its deferred taxes (the \u2018deferred method'). The Company's selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new GILTI tax rules will depend, in part, on analyzing its global income of its CFCs to determine whether it expects to have future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI and, if so, what the impact is expected to be. Because whether the Company expects to have future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI depends on not only its current structure and estimated future results of global operations but also its intent and ability to modify its structure and/or its business, the Company is not yet able to reasonably estimate the effect of this provision of U.S. Tax Reform. Therefore, it has not made any adjustments related to potential GILTI tax in its consolidated financial statements and has not made a policy decision.\nSalaries and benefits for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were $4.7 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, an increase of $99 million. The increase was primarily a result of a $36 million pension settlement charge related to our U.K. pension plan as well as higher incentive accruals as compared to the prior year. Salaries and benefits for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $4.6 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, an increase of $2.3 billion. The increase in expenses was primarily driven by the Merger and our acquisition of Gras Savoye. As a percentage of revenues, salaries and benefits expenses represented 58%, 59% and 60% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nHuman Capital and Benefits\nWhile we are still in the process of analyzing the various Accounting Standards Updates (\u2018ASU') issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u2018FASB'), those which we believe will have a material impact to our financial statements are listed below. See Note 2 - Basis of Presentation, Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nNet Income Attributable to Willis Towers Watson\nInvestment, Risk and Reinsurance\nTotal debt, total equity, and the capitalization ratio at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were as follows:\n____________________\n \u2022 Financial Lines - Financial Lines specializes in brokerage services for financial, political and credit risks. \nAdministration, formerly Exchange Solutions, segments. See our segment revenues analysis for a further discussion of our segment results.\n\nBusiness Overview\nThe table below presents segment commissions and fees and segment interest and other income for CRB for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nLegacy Willis - This plan was frozen in 2009. Approximately one-quarter of the Legacy Willis employees in the United States have a frozen accrued benefit under this plan.\nThe following table sets out the components of CRB revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the pro forma prior year.\n\nOn January 4, 2016, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated June 29, 2015, as amended on November 19, 2015, between Willis, Towers Watson, and Citadel Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willis formed for the purpose of facilitating this transaction (\u2018Merger Sub'), Merger Sub merged with and into Towers Watson, with Towers Watson continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willis.\n\nOther operating expenses include occupancy, legal, marketing, licenses, royalties, supplies, technology, printing and telephone costs, as well as insurance, including premiums on excess insurance and losses on professional liability claims, non-client-reimbursed travel by colleagues, publications, professional subscriptions and development, recruitment, other professional fees and irrecoverable value added and sales taxes.\nThe following table sets out the components of HCB revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the pro forma prior year.\n____________________\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the clients' failure to pay for the services after the services have been rendered, including allowances when client disputes may exist. The related provision is recorded as a reduction to revenue. Our allowance policy is based on the aging of the billed and unbilled client receivables and has been developed based on the write-off history. Facts and circumstances such as the average length of time the receivables are past due, general market conditions, current economic trends and our clients' ability to pay may cause fluctuations in our valuation of billed and unbilled receivables.\nAmortization includes amortization of acquired intangible assets, including acquired internally developed software. Amortization was $591 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $56 million, or 10%, compared to $535 million for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in amortization in 2016 is primarily due to amortization of the intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions of Gras Savoye and Miller. We acquired approximately $231 million and $440 million in intangible assets in our acquisitions of Miller and Gras Savoye, respectively. These intangible assets are amortized over their expected lives which range from 4 to 25 years. See Note 3 - Merger, Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 8 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our intangible assets.\n c. Pension and post-retirement benefit amortization. Adjustments to remove the net periodic benefit costs of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 associated with the amortization of net actuarial losses and prior service credits/costs for Towers Watson's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. \nDefinitions of Constant Currency Change and Organic Change are included in the section entitled \u2018Non-GAAP Financial Measures' elsewhere within this Form 10-K.\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $8.2 billion, compared to $7.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $315 million or 4%. This growth in revenues was driven by strong performances in all segments.\n\n \u25e6 Although we are still finalizing the impact to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018, we expect the total range of adjustment, before the effect of taxes, to be an increase to retained earnings of $375 million to $475 million. \nWe operate in attractive markets - both growing and mature - with a diversified platform across geographies, industries, segments and lines of business. We aim to create and become the premier advisory, broking and solutions company of choice globally. We design and deliver solutions that manage risk, optimize benefits, cultivate talent, and expand the power of capital to protect and strengthen institutions and individuals. We also help organizations improve performance through effective people, risk and financial management by focusing on providing human capital and financial consulting services.\nWe consider adjusted operating income to be an important financial measure, which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors.\nCash flows used in investing activities for 2017 were $335 million, largely driven by $375 million of capital expenditures and capitalized software costs.\nDue to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, commission revenues may vary widely between accounting periods. A period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a \u2018soft' or \u2018softening' market, generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. A \u2018hard' or \u2018firming' market, during which premium rates rise, generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. Rates, however, vary by geography,\nAdditionally in March 2017, the Company repaid the 6.200% senior notes due 2017 totaling $407 million, including accrued interest.\nThe Merger affects the comparability of this data between 2015 and other periods presented. See \u2018Supplementary Pro Forma Financial Information' for additional analysis.\nFree Cash Flow\nAlso on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\u2018SAB 118'), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the U.S. Tax Reform. SAB 118 provides for a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the U.S. Tax Reform enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under Accounting Standards Codification (\u2018ASC') 740, Income Taxes (\u2018ASC 740'). In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of U.S. Tax Reform for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. Adjustments to incomplete and unknown amounts will be recorded and disclosed prospectively during the measurement period. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform.\n \u2022 Group Marketplace (formerly Active Exchanges) - This business is focused on delivering group benefit exchanges, serving the active employees of employers across the United States through our proprietary BenefitConnect or Bright Choices exchange platforms. \nBeginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affect our segment results. These changes, which are detailed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017, include the realignment of certain businesses within our segments, as well as changes to certain allocation methodologies to better reflect the ongoing nature of our businesses. The prior period comparatives reflected in the tables below have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. See Note 4 - Segment Information within Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of these changes.\n \u2022 Restructuring costs and transaction and integration expenses - Management believes it is appropriate to adjust for restructuring costs and transaction and integration expenses when they relate to a specific significant program with a defined set of activities and costs that are not expected to continue beyond a defined period of time, or one-time Merger-related transaction expenses. We believe the adjustment is necessary to present how the Company is performing, both now and in the future when these programs will have concluded. \nBDA total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $654 million, compared to pro forma $487 million for the year ended December 31, 2015; and commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $652 million, compared to pro forma $484 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Individual Marketplace commissions and fees increased by 41%, primarily as a result of the record 2016 annual enrollment season. The rest of the segment commissions and fees increased by 27%, primarily due to Benefits Outsourcing adding new clients and experiencing higher project activity.\nOne-time transition tax - The one-time transition tax is based on the Company's total post-1986 earnings and profits (\u2018E&P') that it previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The Company recorded a provisional amount for the one-\nMarket Conditions\n\nWe believe we can achieve this by:\nAdjusted income taxes/tax rate is defined as the provision for/(benefit from) income taxes adjusted for taxes on certain items of amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, significant litigation settlements, significant pension\n\n \u2022 Individual Marketplace (formerly Retiree & Access Exchanges) - This business provides solutions through a proprietary technology platform, OneExchange Retiree, which enables our employer clients to transition their retirees to individual, defined contribution health plans that provide individuals with a tax-free allowance or contribution to spend on healthcare services at an annual cost that the employer controls, as opposed to group-based, defined benefit health plans that provide groups of individuals with healthcare benefits at uncertain annual costs. \n(i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.\nApart from commitments, guarantees and contingencies, as disclosed herein and Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies located within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference, as of December 31, 2017, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\n a. Intercompany trading. Adjustments to eliminate trading between Legacy Willis and Legacy Towers Watson of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. \nAt the effective time of the Merger (the \u2018Effective Time'), each issued and outstanding share of Towers Watson common stock (the \u2018Towers Watson shares'), was converted into the right to receive 2.6490 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable ordinary shares of Willis (the \u2018Willis ordinary shares'), $0.000115 nominal value per share, other than any Towers Watson shares owned by Towers Watson, Willis or Merger Sub at the Effective Time and the Towers Watson shares held by stockholders who are entitled to, and who properly exercised, dissenter's rights under Delaware law.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nTransaction and integration expenses\nImmediately following the Merger, Willis effected (i) a consolidation (i.e., a reverse stock split under Irish law) of Willis ordinary shares whereby every 2.6490 Willis ordinary shares were consolidated into one Willis ordinary share ($0.000304635 nominal value per share) and (ii) an amendment to its constitution and other organizational documents to change its name from Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company to Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company.\n (i) Other includes salary and benefits, premises, and other expenses incurred to support the ongoing management and facilitation of the programs. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOur methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. These financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n____________________\n____________________\nMerger with Towers Watson\nUnited Kingdom\n\n \u25e6 making the necessary changes to our processes, our IT, our real estate and workforce locations; and \nWe derive the majority of our revenue from either commissions or fees for broking or consulting services. No single client represented a significant concentration of our consolidated revenues for any of the periods presented.\nThe Merger affects the comparability of this data between 2015 and other periods presented. See \u2018Supplementary Pro Forma Segment Revenues Analysis' for additional analysis.\nOther Expense/(Income), Net\n \u2022 Tax effects of internal reorganizations - Relates to the U.S. income tax expense resulting from the completion of internal reorganizations of the ownership of certain businesses that reduced the investments held by our U.S.-controlled subsidiaries. \nIRR total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1.5 billion, compared to $896 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $638 million or 71%. This growth in revenues was driven by the Merger and a full year of revenues from Miller, following our acquisition in May 2015. See the \u2018Supplementary Pro Forma Segment Revenues' section below for additional discussion of our 2016 results.\nManagement believes the adjusted income tax rate presents a rate that is more closely aligned to the rate we would incur if not for the reduction of pre-tax income for the adjusted items, the tax effects of our internal reorganizations and the tax effect of U.S. Tax Reform, which are not core to our current and future operations.\nPension Contributions - The Company has agreed with Trustees of certain plans in the U.K. to contribute deficit funding and minimum ongoing accrual of benefits funding and presented those obligations in the table above. These obligations exclude employee contributions and any potential funding level contributions, which are dependent on future funding level assessments. There are no contractual obligations for our U.S. pension plans. Our total expected contributions to all qualified pension plans, including amounts presented above, for the year ending December 31, 2018 are projected to be $150 million. Additionally, the Company expects to pay $54 million in benefits directly to participants for the year ended 2018.\nInterest Expense\nSalaries and benefits were $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $215 million, or 5%, compared to $4.4 billion for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily related to our acquisitions of Gras Savoye and Miller, which contributed approximately $291 million of the increase, partially offset by increased net periodic benefit credits from the adoption of the granular approach to calculating service and interest costs of $51 million.\nWillis Towers Watson considers several factors prior to the start of each fiscal year when determining the appropriate annual assumptions, including economic forecasts, relevant benchmarks, historical trends, portfolio composition and peer company comparisons. These assumptions, used to determine our pension liabilities and pension expense are reviewed annually by senior\nThese consolidated financial statements conform to U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. The areas that we believe are critical accounting policies include valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients, discretionary compensation, income taxes, commitments, contingencies and accrued liabilities, pension assumptions, and goodwill and intangible assets. The critical accounting policies discussed below involve making difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. These critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate or assumption. Different estimates that we could have used, or changes in estimates that are reasonably likely to occur, may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the Company expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner, such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments. Beginning in 2016, as a result of our plan to restructure or distribute accumulated earnings of certain acquired Towers Watson foreign operations, we accrued deferred taxes on the historical and current year earnings of those subsidiaries. The historical cumulative earnings of our other subsidiaries had been reinvested indefinitely and therefore we had not provided deferred tax liabilities on these amounts. As a result of U.S. Tax Reform we have analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a repatriation. For those investments from which we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of such repatriation, we have recorded a provisional estimate for foreign withholding and state income taxes. In addition, we re-measured the existing deferred tax liability accrued on certain acquired Towers Watson subsidiaries and released the deferred tax liability relating to the outside basis difference. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital, long-term investment requirements or additional guidance relating to U.S. Tax Reform necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for income and foreign withholding taxes, net of credits, may be necessary. Other potential sources of cash may be through the settlement of intercompany loans or return of capital distributions in a tax-efficient manner.\nHCB is the largest segment of the Company, generating approximately 39% of our segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. HCB is focused on addressing our clients' people and risk needs to help them take on the challenges of operating in a global marketplace. HCB is further strengthened with teams of international consultants that provide support through each of our business units to the global headquarters of multinational clients and their foreign subsidiaries.\nThe Company's material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 are as follows:\nConsolidated Revenues\nIn the second quarter of 2016, we began planning targeted staffing reductions in certain portions of the business due to a reduction in business demand or change in business focus (hereinafter referred to as the Business Restructure Program). The main element of the program included workforce reductions, and was completed in 2016.\nCorporate Risk and Broking (\u2018CRB')\nLegacy Willis - This plan covers approximately one third of the Legacy Willis employees in the United Kingdom. The plan is now closed to new entrants. New employees in the United Kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan.\nSegment revenues exclude amounts that were directly incurred on behalf of our clients and reimbursed by them (reimbursed expenses); however, these amounts are included in consolidated revenues.\nOn November 10, 2016, the Company announced the board of directors approved an increase to the existing share repurchase program of $1 billion. The $1 billion increase was in addition to the remaining authority on the Legacy Willis program discussed in the preceding paragraph. At December 31, 2017, approximately $601 million remained on the current repurchase authority. The maximum number of shares that could be repurchased based on the closing price of our ordinary shares on December 31, 2017 of $150.69 was 3,986,473.\nOur results can be materially impacted by changes in currency conversions, which can fluctuate significantly over the course of a calendar year. For the year ended December 31, 2016, currency translation decreased our consolidated revenues by $202 million on a constant currency basis from the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015. The primary currency driving the change was the Pound sterling which weakened against the U.S. dollar during 2016.\nImpact of U.S. Tax Reform\nOur adjusted income tax rates were 21.9% and 20.8% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The lower adjusted tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a prior year tax benefit resulting from an enacted statutory tax rate reduction in the U.K.\n (i) Other includes salary and benefits, premises, and other expenses incurred to support the ongoing management and facilitation of the programs.  Business Restructuring Program\n\nAmortization\n \u2022 Venezuelan currency devaluation - Foreign exchange losses incurred as a consequence of the Venezuelan government's enforced changes to exchange rate mechanisms. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nGuarantees, Acquisition Liabilities and Other Contractual Obligations - Information regarding guarantees and other contractual obligations and their impact on the financial statements is set forth in Item 8, Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 ASU No. 2014-09 \u2018Revenue From Contracts With Customers' \nDepreciation represents the expense incurred over the useful life of our tangible fixed assets and internally developed software. Depreciation was $178 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $19 million, or 12%, compared to $159 million for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily related to our acquisitions of Gras Savoye and Miller and our normal capital expenditures.\nCRB operates as an integrated global team comprising both functional and geographic leadership with three global offerings:\n (i) As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 increased by $13 million and $1 million, respectively, increasing free cash flow by the same amount. See Item 8, Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10-K report for a further discussion of this change.  The decrease in free cash flows in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily resulted from higher capital expenditures and higher discretionary compensation payments made in 2017 for the 2016 compensation cycle. These discretionary compensation payments were lower in 2016 because they included only a partial payment to Legacy Towers Watson colleagues due to the timing of the Merger.\nThe markets for our consulting, technology and solutions, and marketplace services are subject to changes as a result of economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, and increased competition from established and new competitors. We believe the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation, the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment, global scale, quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients' unique needs. With regard to the market for exchanges, we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients, a strong reputation for efficient execution and an innovative service delivery model and platform. Part of the employer sponsored insurance market has matured and become more fragmented while other segments remain in the entry phase. As these market segments continue to evolve, we may experience growth in intervals, with periods of accelerated expansion balanced by periods of modest growth.\nTotal costs of providing services were $7.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $6.7 billion for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $609 million or 9%. See the analysis below for further information.", "item_7_text": "Benefit Delivery and Administration (\u2018BDA')\n \u2022 Transport - Transport provides specialist expertise to the transportation, aerospace, marine and inspace industries.  The table below presents segment commissions and fees, and segment interest and other income for CRB for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nSee Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in Item 8 within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWithin the measures referred to as adjusted\u201d, we have adjusted for significant items which will not be settled in cash, or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations. These items include the following:\n \u2022 Deferred tax valuation allowance - Adjustment to remove the effects of a release of the valuation allowance against certain U.S. deferred tax assets. \n\nPro forma financial information is for illustrative purposes only, and is based on adjustments that are estimates based upon available information and certain assumptions that Willis Towers Watson management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, as described in \u2018Pro Forma Adjustments' below. The pro forma financial information has not been adjusted to give effect to certain expected financial benefits of the Merger, such as revenue synergies, tax savings and cost synergies, or the anticipated costs to achieve these benefits, including the cost of integration activities. The pro forma financial information does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations of Willis Towers Watson would have been had the Merger occurred on the date indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations. The actual results of operations will differ, potentially significantly, from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to a variety of factors, including access to additional information, changes in value not currently identified and changes in operating results following the date of the unaudited pro forma financial information.\nFiduciary Funds\nWe maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in several countries, with the most significant defined benefit plans offered in the U.S. and U.K. Our disclosures in Note 12 - Retirement Benefits contain additional information about our other less significant but material retirement plans. Within our critical accounting policy discussion, we have excluded analysis for plans outside of those noted in the description below, as any variance of recorded information based on management's estimates would be immaterial.\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from commissions from our brokerage businesses and fees for consulting services. Brokerage commissions and fees negotiated in lieu of commissions are recognized at the later of the policy inception date or when the policy placement is complete or as the fees are otherwise determined. Commissions on additional premiums and adjustments are recognized when approved by or agreed between the parties and collectability is reasonably assured. Consulting revenue is generally recognized as services are performed. No single client represented a significant concentration of our consolidated revenues for any of our three most recent fiscal years.\nBenefit from income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $100 million, $96 million and $33 million, respectively. The benefit in 2017 was primarily due to the impact of U.S. Tax Reform. The provisional net benefit of $204 million includes a $208 million net benefit due to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate and re-measurement of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities primarily related to acquisition-based intangibles. The benefit from income taxes in 2016 was primarily due to the release of a portion of U.S. valuation allowances and shifts in the global mix of income as a result of the Merger. This shift resulted in additional deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates, which reduced the global effective tax rate. The benefit from income taxes in 2015 was primarily due to an income tax benefit from the release of a portion of U.S. valuation allowances.\nThrough these strategies we aim to accelerate revenue, cash flow, EBITDA and earnings growth, and generate compelling returns for investors by delivering tangible growth in revenues and capitalizing on the identified cost synergies.\nA reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows:\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $7.9 billion, compared to $3.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $4.1 billion, or 106%. This growth in revenues was driven by our merger with Towers Watson and our acquisition of Gras Savoye.\nThe HCB segment provides an array of advice, broking, solutions and software for our clients.\nOn February 23, 2018, the board of directors approved an increase to the existing share repurchase program of $400 million. The $400 million increase is in addition to the remaining authority of $601 million as of December 31, 2017.\n(i) The tax effect was calculated using an effective tax rate for each item.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we (i) entered into a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility to replace our previous $800 million revolving credit facility. Borrowings against the $1.25 billion facility of $409 million and \u20ac45 million were used to repay all outstanding borrowings against the $800 million facility and the 7-year term loan due July 23, 2018; (ii) repaid our 6.200% senior notes due 2017 totaling $407 million, including accrued interest; and (iii) completed an offering of $650 million of 3.600% Senior Notes due 2024. Net proceeds of $644 million were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\n\n(i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.\nHuman Capital and Benefits (\u2018HCB')\nCosts of Providing Services\nCRB generated approximately 33% of Willis Towers Watson segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, and places more than $20 billion of premiums into the insurance markets, annually.\nIRR total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.5 billion. Included in total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 is a previously disclosed settlement with JLT of \u00a328 million ($41 million) related to the Fine Art, Jewellery and Specie team. Commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.5 billion, representing a decrease of $7 million. The organic decline was primarily related to the following factors: soft market conditions and renewal factors impacting our Willis Re and Portfolio and Underwriting Services businesses, particularly in North America; a decline in overall insurance industry M&A activity impacting our Willis Towers Watson Securities business after a record year in 2015; and a decline arising from lower demand in risk consulting projects.\nWe recorded a combined $113 million net periodic benefit income for our U.S. and U.K. plans for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the U.S. and U.K. plans, the following table presents our estimated net periodic benefit income for 2018 and the impact to both plans of a 0.25% increase and decrease to both the expected return on assets (\u2018EROA') and the discount rate assumptions, and the projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2017 and the impact of a 0.25% increase and decrease to the discount rates:\nAmortization includes amortization of acquired intangible assets, including acquired internally developed software. Amortization for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $581 million and $591 million, respectively, a decrease of $10 million. Our intangible amortization is more heavily weighted to the initial years of the useful lives of the related intangibles, and therefore amortization expense will decrease over time. Amortization for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $591 million and $76 million, respectively, an increase of $515 million. The primary driver of the increase in amortization was our acquisition of approximately $4.0 billion in intangible assets in our Merger with Towers Watson and our acquisition of $231 million and $440 million of intangible assets related to our acquisitions of Miller and Gras Savoye, respectively.\n f. Amortization. Historical amortization expense of $71 million was removed and amortization expense of $459 million has been recorded to reflect the estimated fair values of Towers Watson's identifiable intangible assets and related \nClaims, Lawsuits and Other Proceedings, including Stanford Financial Group Litigation - Information regarding claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, including the Stanford Financial Group litigation, and their impact on the consolidated financial statements is set forth in Item 8, Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCapital Commitments\nOPERATIONS\nNet income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $420 million, a decrease of $220 million compared to $640 million for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by increased transaction and integration expenses of $147 million and restructuring costs of $67 million in 2016 and gains on disposals of $80 million and re-measurement of equity interests of $59 million in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense of $166 million.\nBased on our balance sheets, combined cash flows, current market conditions and information available to us at this time, we believe that Willis Towers Watson has sufficient liquidity, which includes our undrawn revolving credit facilities, to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months, including investing in the business for growth, creating value through the integration of Willis, Towers Watson and Gras Savoye, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments, and contemplated share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors.\n \u2022 Willis Towers Watson Securities - Willis Towers Watson Securities, formerly Capital Markets & Advisory, provides investment banking services to companies involved in the insurance and reinsurance industries for a broad array of merger and acquisition transactions as well as capital markets products. \n \u25e6 targeting and delivering identified, highly achievable cost savings as a direct consequence of the Merger.  We care as much about how we work as we do about the impact that we make. This means commitment to shared values, a framework that guides how we run our business and serve clients.\nAt December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants.\n__________________________\nCash flows used in investing activities of $943 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily driven by $857 million used in the acquisitions of operations and $146 million for capital expenditures.\n\nRestructuring costs related to the Business Restructuring Program for the year ended December 31, 2016 by segment are as follows:\n (ii) Shares issued for Towers Watson based on approximately 69 million Towers Watson shares outstanding at January 4, 2016. \n____________________\n \u2022 ASU No. 2016-02 \u2018Leases' \nDecember 31, 2015 was income of $55 million, which included gains on disposals of operations of $25 million, and a gain on re-measurement of equity interests related to the Gras Savoye acquisition of $59 million, partially offset by the $30 million impact of the Venezuelan currency devaluation.\n \u2022 Fair value adjustment to deferred revenue - Adjustment in 2016 to normalize for the deferred revenue written down as part of the purchase accounting for the Merger. \nA reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\n \u25e6 Our accounting for deferred costs will change. First, for those portions of the business that previously deferred costs (related to system implementation activities), the length of time over which we amortize those costs will extend to a longer estimated contract term. For 2017 calendar year and prior, these costs were amortized over a typical period of 3-5 years in accordance with the initial stated terms of the customer agreements. Second, other types of arrangements with associated costs now meet the criteria for cost deferral under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This guidance will now apply to our broking arrangements and certain consulting engagements. We have calculated a retained earnings adjustment to reflect this cumulative change for contracts not complete as of the transition date. \n\n\nWe have established provisions against various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance and consulting services in the ordinary course of business. Such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported. These provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice. In certain cases, where a range of loss exists, we accrue the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.\nThis segment is our third largest segment and generated approximately 19% of segment revenues for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2017. With approximately 75% of the revenues for this segment split between North America and the U.K., this segment includes the following businesses and offerings:\nTotal cash dividends of $277 million were paid during the year ended December 31, 2017. In February 2018, the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.60 per share ($2.40 per share annualized rate), which will be paid on or about April 16, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 31, 2018.\nSummarized Consolidated Cash Flows\nReconciliations of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:\n \u2022 Willis Re - Willis Re provides reinsurance industry clients with an understanding of how risk affects capital and financial performance and advises on the best ways to manage related outcomes. \n(i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.\n \u2022 Organic Change - Excludes both the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as described above, as well as the period-over-period impact of acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that excluding transaction-related items from our U.S. GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to our investors, and it is important in illustrating what our core operating results would have been had we not incurred these transaction-related items, since the nature, size and number of these transaction-related items can vary from period to period.  The constant currency and organic change results, and a reconciliation from the reported results for consolidated revenues, are included in the Consolidated Revenues section within this Form 10-K. These measures are also reported by segment in the \u2018As Reported Segment Revenues' and \u2018Supplementary Pro Forma Segment Revenues' sections within this Form 10-K.\nWe evaluate our revenues on an as reported (U.S. GAAP), constant currency and organic basis. We believe providing constant currency and organic information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our comparable results, consistent with how we evaluate our performance internally.\n (i) The tax effect was calculated using the statutory tax rate applicable to the item being adjusted for in the jurisdiction from which each adjustment arises. \n (i) Other contractual obligations include capital lease commitments, put option obligations and investment fund capital call obligations, the timing of which are included at the earliest point they may fall due.  Debt obligations and facilities - The Company's material debt and related interest obligations at December 31, 2017 are shown in the above table. Mandatory repayments of debt over the next 12 months include the scheduled repayment of the current portion of the Company's 2019 term loan. The Company also has the right, at its option, to prepay indebtedness under the credit facility without further penalty and to redeem the senior notes by paying a \u2018make-whole' premium as provided under the applicable debt instrument.\n\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company adjusts valuation allowances\n____________________\nCash Flows (Used In)/From Financing Activities\n\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $188 million, $184 million and $142 million, respectively. Interest expense is primarily related to interest on our senior notes and term loans. Interest expense increased by $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which primarily resulted from additional levels of indebtedness. Interest expense increased by $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily related to additional debt acquired in the Merger and as part of the acquisition of Gras Savoye.\n____________________\nAdjusted Operating Income\nExecutive compensation - Starting with compensation paid in 2018, Section 162(m) will limit the Company from deducting compensation, including performance-based compensation, in excess of $1 million paid to anyone who, starting in 2018, serves as the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or who is among the three most highly compensated executive officers. The only exception to this rule is for compensation that is paid pursuant to a binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 that would have otherwise been deductible under the prior Section 162(m) rules. Accordingly, any compensation paid in the future pursuant to new compensation arrangements entered into after November 2, 2017, even if performance-based, will count towards the $1 million deduction limit if paid to a covered executive. The Company recorded a provisional income tax expense of $8 million relating to our compensation plans not qualifying for the binding contract exception. We are in the process of obtaining additional information needed to complete our analysis of the binding contract requirement on the various compensation plans to determine the full impact of the law change. In addition, guidance may be released which could also impact our estimates.\nMarket conditions in our broking industry are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world, insurance rate movements, and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDepreciation represents the expense incurred over the useful life of our tangible fixed assets and internally developed software. Depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $203 million and $178 million, respectively, an increase of $25 million. This increase was due primarily to a higher depreciable base of assets resulting from additional assets placed in service in 2016. Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $178 million and $95 million, respectively, an increase of $83 million. This increase was primarily driven by the Merger and our acquisition of Gras Savoye.\nThe Company's accounting for the following law changes of U.S. Tax Reform is incomplete, and it is not yet able to make reasonable estimates of the effects. Therefore, no provisional adjustment was recorded.\n (i) After taking into account the impact of the reverse stock split on January 4, 2016. \n____________________\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had fiduciary funds of $3.3 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.\nValuation allowances - The Company must assess whether valuation allowances assessments are affected by various aspects of U.S. Tax Reform (e.g., limitation on net interest expense in excess of 30% of adjusted taxable income). As of December 31, 2017, no changes to valuation allowances have been recorded as a result of U.S. Tax Reform.\nThe BDA segment, formerly Exchange Solutions, provides primary medical and ancillary benefit exchange and outsourcing services to active employees and retirees across both the group and individual markets. A significant portion of the revenues in this segment is recurring in nature, driven by either the commissions from the policies we sell, or from long-term service contracts with our clients that typically range from three to five years. Revenues across this segment may be seasonal, driven by the magnitude and timing of client transition activities, and we typically increase our membership levels significantly effective January 1, after calendar year-end benefits elections.\nFree cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash used to purchase fixed assets and software for internal use and is used to evaluate our liquidity.\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2016 was $775 million. The primary drivers during the period were debt issuance of $2.0 billion, debt repayments of $1.9 billion, net payments on the revolving credit facility of $237 million, dividend payments of $199 million, and share repurchases of $396 million. The debt issuance of $2.0 billion was primarily the issuance of $450 million of senior notes due 2021, $550 million of senior notes due 2026, \u20ac540 million ($609 million) of senior notes due 2022 and a $400 million drawdown on the 1-year term loan facility. The debt repayments of $1.9 billion were primarily $300 million repayment of senior notes due 2016, $400 million repayment of Legacy Towers Watson debt and repayments of $592 million and $400 million on the 1-year term loan facility.\nThe table below presents segment commissions and fees and segment interest and other income for IRR for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\n h. Income taxes. Adjustments to record the income tax impact of the pro forma adjustments, including the removal of the tax consequences of the repatriation of foreign earnings to partially fund the pre-Merger special dividend. The income tax expense was calculated based on the U.S. and foreign statutory rates applicable to adjustments made. Where applicable, a U.S. statutory rate of 40% was used. Pro forma adjustments for income tax purposes have been determined without regard to potential tax planning strategies that may result from the Merger of Towers Watson with Willis. Tax benefits from the Merger have not been considered in our pro forma adjustments. \nA reconciliation of income from operations to adjusted operating income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the foreign currency impact resulted from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against a number of currencies, most significantly the Euro and the Pound sterling.\nBenefit Delivery and Administration\nTypically, our business benefits from regulatory change, political risk or economic uncertainty. Insurance broking generally tracks the economy, but demand for both insurance broking and consulting services usually remains steady during times of uncertainty. We have some businesses, such as our health and benefits and administration businesses, which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change.\n (i) The tax effect was calculated using an effective tax rate for each item.  Our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to revenue growth across all segments partially offset by higher salary and benefits costs. The prior year also included settlement income of \u00a328 million ($41 million) related to the Fine Arts, Jewellery and Specie team.\n\nThe table below presents segment commissions and fees, and segment interest and other income for IRR for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nBonus Depreciation - While the Company has not completed its determination of all capital expenditures that qualify for immediate expensing, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provisional tax deduction of $40 million based on its current intent to fully expense all qualifying expenditures. The Company will analyze the dates all capital expenditures were placed in service or acquired and consider any future guidance within the next twelve months to finalize the deduction. This resulted in an increase of approximately $14 million to the Company's U.S. federal current income taxes receivable and a corresponding increase in its net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $14 million.\nIn 2016, we began managing our business across four integrated reportable operating segments: Human Capital and Benefits; Corporate Risk and Broking; Investment, Risk and Reinsurance; and Benefits Delivery and Administration, formerly Exchange Solutions.\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $7.9 billion, compared to $7.5 billion pro forma revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $395 million, or 5%. This growth was driven by a 7% increase due to our acquisitions of Gras Savoye and Miller and 1% organic revenue growth, partially offset by adverse foreign currency exchange movements of 3%. The primary drivers of our growth were within our Corporate Risk and Broking and Benefits Delivery and\nWillis Towers Watson is a global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth. With roots dating to 1828, Willis Towers Watson has more than 43,000 employees and services clients in more than 140 countries and territories. We design and deliver solutions that manage risk, optimize benefits, cultivate talent, and expand the power of capital to protect and strengthen institutions and individuals. We believe our unique perspective allows us to see the critical intersections between talent, assets and ideas - the dynamic formula that drives business performance.\n____________________\nCosts of Providing Services\nBDA generated approximately 9% of our segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. BDA provides services across four integrated or related offerings to customers primarily in the U.S. through four business units:\n \u2022 Insurance Consulting and Technology - Insurance Consulting and Technology, formerly Risk Consulting and Software, is a global business that provides advice and technology solutions to the insurance industry, as well as to corporate clients with respect to their insurance programs. Services include software and technology, risk and capital management, products and pricing, financial and regulatory reporting, financial and capital modeling, M&A, outsourcing and business management. \nGoodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, and the Company had nine reporting units as of October 1, 2017.\n \u2022 Max Matthiessen - Max Matthiessen is a leading advisor and broker within insurance, benefits, human resources and savings in the Nordic region. The business specializes in providing human capital and benefits administration together with providing market leading savings and insurance solutions. \nThe CRB segment provides a broad range of risk advice, insurance broking and consulting services to clients worldwide ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations. The segment delivers integrated global solutions tailored to client needs and underpinned by data and analytics.\nAdjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to $1.8 billion, from $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $147 million, or 9%. Income from operations increased by $187 million, largely due to revenue growth across all segments partially offset by higher salary and benefits costs. The prior year also included settlement income of \u00a328 million ($41 million) related to the Fine Arts, Jewellery and Specie team.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities or new debt offerings.\nA reconciliation of income from operations to adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows:\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe consider adjusted revenues to be an important financial measure, which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors.\n \u2022 Constant Currency Change - Represents the year over year change in revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. To calculate this impact, the prior year local currency results are first translated using the current year monthly average exchange rates. The change is calculated by comparing the prior year revenues, translated at the current year monthly average exchange rates, to the current year as reported revenues, for the same period. We believe constant currency measures provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to performance by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on period-over-period comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. \nRestructuring costs and Interest expense\n(i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.\nTo assist the reader in understanding our comparative analysis, we have included discussion and analysis of pro forma financial information for Willis Towers Watson as if the Towers Watson Merger had occurred on January 1, 2015.\n\nThe pro forma financial information for 2015 is only for Willis and Towers Watson and does not include Gras Savoye or other M&A activity on a pro forma basis.\nEvents that could change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include significant changes in operating results, potential future acquisitions or divestitures, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or regulatory matters, or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets.\nsettlement and curtailment activity, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, loss/(gain) on disposal of operations, tax effects of internal reorganizations and U.S. Tax Reform, and non-recurring items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results, divided by adjusted income before taxes. Adjusted income taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate.\n \u2022 Retirement - The Retirement business provides actuarial support, plan design, and administrative services for traditional pension and retirement savings plans. Our colleagues help our clients assess the costs and risks of retirement plans on cash flow, earnings and the balance sheet, the effects of changing workforce demographics on their retirement plans and retiree benefit adequacy and security. \nOperating Leases - We lease office space and furniture under operating lease agreements with terms typically ranging from three to twenty years. We have determined that there is not a large concentration of leases that will expire in any one fiscal year. Consequently, management anticipates that any increase in future rent expense on leases will be mainly market-driven. We also lease cars and selected computer equipment under operating lease agreements. For acquired operating leases, intangible assets or liabilities have been recognized for the difference between the contractual cash obligations and the estimated market rates at the time of acquisition. These intangibles are amortized to rent expense but do not affect our contractual cash obligations. See further discussion in Item 8, Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nValuation of Billed and Unbilled Receivables from Clients\nHCB commissions and fees, and total segment revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $3.2 billion, compared to $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Retirement revenues increased in Western Europe, International and Great Britain and were partially offset by a decline in North America. The decline in North America was expected as bulk lump sum projects declined year over year. Actuarial consulting projects in Great Britain were strong due to regulation changes. The growth in Talent & Rewards was flat. Healthcare consulting revenues in Health and Benefits were up significantly for all markets globally. North America grew due to increased consulting and product demand and Great Britain grew due to global benefits solutions implementations. Revenue in the Technology and Administration Solutions business in Great Britain experienced strong growth as a result of new administration clients and project activity.\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\n \u2022 Provision for Stanford and other significant litigation - The 2016 provision for the Stanford litigation matter, which we consider to be a non-ordinary course litigation matter. We will also include other litigation matters which we believe are not representative of our core business operations. \nBusiness Strategy\nRestructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $132 million, all of which related to the final year of the Operational Improvement Program (\u2018OIP'). Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $193 million, of which $145 million related to the OIP and $48 million related to the Business Restructuring Program. Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $126 million, all of which was related to the OIP. See our discussion in the Operational Improvement Program and Business Restructuring Program section herein and Note 5 - Restructuring Costs within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details about these expenses.\n_____________________\n\nExecutive Overview\nOther operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1.6 billion, compared to $1.4 billion for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $105 million or 7%. The increase was primarily related to our acquisitions of Gras Savoye and Miller, which contributed approximately $135 million of the increase. In 2016, we accrued $50 million for the Stanford litigation, which was $20 million less than the $70 million accrued in 2015.\n \u2022 Wholesale Insurance Broking - Wholesale Insurance Broking provides wholesale and specialist broking services to retail brokers. \nShare Repurchase Program\nReduction of the federal corporate tax rate - Beginning January 1, 2018, the Company's U.S. income will be taxed at a 21% federal corporate tax rate. Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recalculated as of the enactment date using current tax laws and rates expected to be in effect when the deferred tax items reverse in future periods, which is 21%. Consequently, the Company has recorded a provisional decrease in its net deferred tax liabilities of $208 million, with a corresponding deferred income tax benefit of $208 million. While the Company is able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, it may be affected by other analyses related to U.S. Tax Reform that could result in other adjustments to U.S. federal deferred tax balances, including analysis of tax amounts in other comprehensive income and any future guidance issued.\n\nOperational Improvement Program\nThis discussion includes forward-looking statements. See \u2018Disclaimer Regarding Forward-looking Statements' for certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and \u2018Risk Factors' in Item 1A for a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in those statements.\n \u2022 Leveraging our combined distribution strength and global footprint to enhance market penetration and provide a platform for further innovation; and \n \u2022 Investment - Investment provides advice to improve investment outcomes for asset owners using a broad and sophisticated framework for managing risk. \nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $551 million, compared to $765 million for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $214 million. The decrease was primarily due to increases in transaction and integration expenses of $147 million and restructuring costs of $67 million.\n\nTax Related Liabilities -\nWe have included the reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues in the table below, together with our reconciliation of the pro forma revenues change to the constant currency and organic changes.\nThe pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2015 combines: (i) the historical consolidated statement of operations of Willis Towers Watson for the year ended December 31, 2015 and (ii) the historical consolidated statement of operations of Towers Watson for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 less the historical consolidated statement of operations of Towers Watson for the six months ended December 31, 2014, plus the historical consolidated statement of operations of Towers Watson for the six months ended December 31, 2015.\n g. Interest Expense. Net adjustments to interest expense include additional interest and amortization of related deferred debt issuance costs. Approximately $13 million incremental interest expense was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to a borrowing under a $340 million term loan as part of the funding for the pre-Merger special dividend on December 29, 2015 and the portion of the senior notes issuance used to repay Towers Watson's existing debt at the time of the Merger. \nThe pro forma financial information is only for Willis and Towers Watson and does not include Gras Savoye or other merger or acquisition activity on a pro forma basis.\nWillis Towers Watson Plan - Substantially all U.S. employees are eligible to participate in this plan. Benefits are provided under a stable value pension plan design. The original stable value design came into effect on January 1, 2012. As of July 1, 2017, existing plan participants earn benefits without having to make employee contributions, and all newly eligible employees are required to contribute 2% of pay to participate in the plan.\nA reconciliation of net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\n\nAlthough approximately 22% of our revenues are generated in the U.K. on an annual basis, only about 13% of revenues are denominated in Pounds sterling as much of the insurance business is transacted in U.S. dollars. Approximately 19% of our expenses are denominated in Pounds sterling, thus we generally benefit from a weakening Pound sterling in our income from operations. However, we have a Company hedging strategy for this aspect of our business, which is designed to mitigate significant fluctuations in currency.\nBDA total segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $729 million and $654 million, respectively. Individual Marketplace revenues increased by 10%, and the rest of the segment grew by 14%, led by Group Marketplace and Benefits Outsourcing. Growth in the Individual and Group Marketplaces resulted from the additional 2017 enrollments, and Benefits Outsourcing's growth was a result of new client wins and special projects.\nAn estimated annual bonus amount is initially developed at the beginning of each fiscal year in conjunction with our budgeting process. Estimated annual operating performance is reviewed quarterly and the discretionary annual bonus amount is then adjusted, if necessary, by management to reflect changes in the forecast of pre-bonus profitability for the year.\nThe Company has no material commitments for capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures for fixed assets and software for internal use were $300 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Expected capital expenditures for fixed assets and software for internal use are approximately $285 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect cash from operations to adequately provide for these cash needs.\nAn analysis of cumulative restructuring costs recognized for the Operational Improvement Program from its commencement through the year ended December 31, 2017 by segment is as follows:\nOther operating expenses include occupancy, legal, marketing, licenses, royalties, supplies, technology, printing and telephone costs, as well as insurance, including premiums on excess insurance and losses on professional liability claims, non-client-reimbursed travel by colleagues, publications, professional subscriptions and development, recruitment, other professional fees and irrecoverable value added and sales taxes.\nThe table below details our revenues and expenses by transactional currency for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n \u2022 Delivering a powerful client proposition with an integrated global platform. Our combined offerings provide comprehensive advice, analytics, specialty capabilities and solutions covering benefits, benefits delivery solutions, brokerage and advisory, risk and capital management, and talent and rewards; \nAs an insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best means of managing risk and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network. We operate the largest private Medicare exchange in the U.S. Through this exchange and those for active employees, we help our clients move to a more sustainable economic model by capping and controlling the costs associated with healthcare benefits.\nEconomic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.\n____________________\nOther Operating Expenses\nWe are not an insurance company, and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account.\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nReconciliations of income from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates to adjusted income before taxes and provision for/(benefit from) income taxes to adjusted income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\namortization. See Item 8, Note 3 - Merger, Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 8 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\nAdjusted revenues is defined as total revenues adjusted for the fair value adjustment for deferred revenues that would otherwise have been recognized but for the purchase accounting treatment of these transactions. U.S. GAAP accounting requires the elimination of this revenue.\n\nHCB total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $3.1 billion, compared to $584 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $2.5 billion or 434%. This growth in revenues was driven by our Merger and our acquisition of Gras Savoye. See the \u2018Supplementary Pro Forma Segment Revenues' section below for additional discussion of our 2016 results.\nIn May 2017, we completed an offering of $650 million of 3.600% senior notes due 2024. Net proceeds of $644 million were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nSupplementary Pro Forma Segment Revenues\nAdjusted operating income is defined as income from operations adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, significant litigation settlements, significant pension settlement and curtailment activity, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue and non-recurring items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results.\n\n \u2022 Pension settlement and curtailment gains and losses - Adjustment to remove significant pension settlement and curtailment gains and losses to better present how the Company is performing. \n k. Transaction and integration expenses. Transaction and integration costs related to the Merger and have been eliminated.  Consolidated Revenues\nPro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations\nRestructuring Costs\n \u2022 Gains and losses on disposals of operations - Adjustment to remove the gain or loss resulting from disposed operations. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, there was a $96 million benefit from income taxes, due primarily to a benefit from the release of a portion of our U.S. valuation allowances and shifts in the global mix of income as a result of the Merger. This shift creates additional deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates, which reduces the global effective tax rate. For the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015, there was a provision for income taxes of $70 million. Legacy Willis had a benefit from income taxes due to the release of a portion of U.S. valuation allowances in 2015 which was more than offset by the provision for income taxes for Legacy Towers Watson.\nIn April 2014, Legacy Willis announced a multi-year operational improvement program designed to strengthen its client service capabilities and deliver future cost savings. The main elements of the program, which was completed during 2017, included: moving more than 3,500 support roles from higher cost locations to facilities in lower cost locations; net workforce reductions in support positions; lease consolidation in real estate; and information technology systems simplification and rationalization.\nThe table below sets forth our summarized consolidated statements of comprehensive income and data as a percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nOther Expense/(Income), Net\nOur shares are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n(i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.\nThe Company believes that these measures are relevant and provide useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry to provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing our operating performance, and in the case of free cash flow, our liquidity results.\nAt December 31, 2017, our material mandatory debt repayments over the next twelve months consist of scheduled repayments of $85 million on our term loan maturing in 2019.\nCash flows from investing activities for 2016 were $195 million, largely driven by $476 million of cash acquired as a result of our Merger with Towers Watson, which was a non-cash transaction as it was consummated through the issuance of shares. Cash inflows were partially offset by $303 million of fixed assets and software for internal use and capitalized costs of developing software.\nAdjusted income before taxes is defined as income from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, significant litigation settlements, significant pension settlement and curtailment activity, the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue, (gain)/loss on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted income before taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate.\nIncome from Operations\nThe IRR segment uses a sophisticated approach to risk, which helps clients free up capital and manage investment complexity. The segment works closely with investors, reinsurers and insurers to manage the equation between risk and return. Blending advanced analytics with deep institutional knowledge, IRR identifies new opportunities to maximize performance. IRR provides investment consulting services and insurance specific services and solutions through reserves opinions, software, ratemaking, usage-based insurance, risk underwriting and reinsurance broking.\nOur revenues can be materially impacted by changes in currency conversions, which can fluctuate significantly over the course of a calendar year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, currency translation decreased our consolidated revenues by $27 million. The decrease was driven primarily by a weaker Pound sterling during the first half of the year, partially offset by increases in the Pound sterling, Euro, the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar in the second half of the year.\nDepreciation\nOur compensation program includes a discretionary bonus that is determined by management and has historically been paid once per fiscal year in the form of cash and/or deferred stock units after our annual operating results are finalized.\nTransaction and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $269 million, which consists of costs associated with our information technology and finance initiatives and rationalization, property consolidation, benefits harmonization and costs associated with the settlement of the Merger-related appraisal demand lawsuit (see Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Transaction and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $177 million. Approximately $162 million of these expenses were related to the Merger and $15 million were related to the acquisition of Gras Savoye. Transaction and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $84 million. Approximately $58 million of these expenses were related to the Merger, $15 million were related to the acquisition of Gras Savoye and $11 million were related to our acquisition of Miller.\nCorporate Risk and Broking\nThe following table presents the summarized consolidated cash flow information for the years ended:\nDescriptions of our U.S. and U.K. plans, which comprise 91% of our projected benefit obligations and 93% of our plan assets, are below:\n (i) Includes pro forma adjustments made in the Supplementary Pro Forma Financial Information section in this Form 10-K.  Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.6 billion, compared to pro forma $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $109 million. The increase in adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by our acquisition of Gras Savoye, the settlement with JLT of \u00a328 million ($41 million) related to the Fine Art, Jewellery and Specie team, and the performance of our Benefits Delivery and Administration segment.\nBenefit from Income Taxes\nDepreciation\n \u25e6 The Company has adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach on January 1, 2018, and has applied the new standard only to contracts that are not completed as of the transition date. \nCash Flows (Used In)/From Investing Activities\nWe offer clients a broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks, and to enhance business performance by improving their ability to attract, retain and engage a talented workforce. Our risk control services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial analysis), to a variety of due diligence services, to the provision of practical on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss control consulting), as well as analytical and advisory services (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies). We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they occur. These services include contingency planning, security audits and product tampering plans. We help our clients enhance their business performance by delivering consulting services, technology and solutions that help organizations anticipate, identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities in human capital management as well as investment advice to help our clients develop disciplined and efficient strategies to meet their investment goals.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\nAdjusted net income is defined as net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, significant litigation settlements, significant pension settlement and curtailment activity, the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue, loss/(gain) on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and the related tax effect of those adjustments, the tax effects of internal reorganizations and U.S. Tax Reform. This measure is used solely for the purpose of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share.\n \u25e6 The majority of our leases are currently considered operating leases and will be capitalized as a lease asset on our balance sheets with a related lease liability for the obligated lease payments when the ASU is adopted. The ASU becomes effective for the Company at the beginning of the 2019 fiscal year; early adoption is permitted. \nexpenses were related to the Merger and $15 million were related to the integration of Gras Savoye. For the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015, transaction expenses related to the Merger of $151 million have been eliminated as part of the pro forma adjustments. Of the remaining $30 million of transaction and integration expenses, approximately $15 million were related to Gras Savoye, $11 million were related to Miller, and $4 million were related to other miscellaneous M&A activity.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, the Company performed Step 1 of the two-step impairment test for all reporting units. Each of the reporting units' estimated fair values were in excess of their carrying values. To perform the test, we used valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit that fall under income or market approaches. Under the discounted cash flow method, an income approach, the business enterprise value is determined by discounting to present value the terminal value which is calculated using debt-free after-tax cash flows for a finite period of years. Key estimates in this approach were internal financial projection estimates prepared by management, business risk, and expected rates of return on capital. The guideline company method, a market approach, develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publicly traded companies. Key estimates and selection of valuation multiples rely on the selection of similar companies, obtaining estimates of forecast revenues and EBITDA estimates for the similar companies and selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics. Under the similar transactions method, a market approach, actual transaction prices and operating data from companies deemed reasonably similar to the reporting units is used to develop valuation multiples as an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for the business units.\nThe following table sets out the components of IRR revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the pro forma prior year.\nFunding is based on actuarially determined contributions and is limited to amounts that are currently deductible for tax purposes, or as agreed to with the plan trustees for the U.K. plans. Since funding calculations are based on different measurements than those used for accounting purposes, pension contributions are not equal to net periodic benefit cost.\n \u2022 Tax effect of U.S.Tax Reform - Relates to the (1) U.S. income tax adjustment of deferred taxes upon the change in the federal corporate tax rate, (2) the impact of the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits, and (3) the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liabilities associated with the U.S. tax on certain foreign earnings offset with a write-off of deferred tax assets that will no longer be realizable under U.S. Tax Reform. \nOther expense/(income), net, includes other gains and losses, including gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other expense/(income), net for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was expense of $61 million and $27 million, respectively, which were primarily foreign currency transaction losses. Other expense/(income), net for the year ended\nIn March 2017, we entered into a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility replacing our previous $800 million revolving credit facility. Borrowings against the $1.25 billion facility of $409 million and \u20ac45 million were used to repay all outstanding borrowings against the $800 million facility and the 7-year term loan due July 23, 2018.\nSupplementary Pro Forma Financial Information\nOther Operating Expenses\nDefinitions of Constant Currency Change and Organic Change are included in the section entitled \u2018Non-GAAP Financial Measures' in this Form 10-K.\nAdditionally, at December 31, 2017, $362 million was available to draw against our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility as compared to $557 million, which was available to draw against our previous $800 million revolving credit facility at December 31, 2016.\nCRB commissions and fees, and total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $2.6 billion, compared to $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. All regions contributed to the strong revenue growth led by International followed by Western Europe, North America and Great Britain. International's growth was fueled by excellent client retention and strong new business. Western Europe, North America and Great Britain experienced good client retention and solid new business growth.\nThe impact of acquisitions and divestitures did not have a significant impact on the change in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 since most of these transactions happened in the latter part of the year. Prospectively, our 2018 revenues will exclude a net $65 million related to the impact of various acquisitions and divestitures initiated or completed in 2017.\n\n(Benefit from)/Provision for Income Taxes\nCash flows from operating activities for 2015 was $244 million, which included net income of $384 million, adjusted for $38 million of non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to cash used in operating activities, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $178 million.\nTransaction and integration expenses\n \u2022 Uncertain Tax Positions - The table above does not include liabilities for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, Income Taxes. The settlement period for the $59 million liability, which excludes interest and penalties, cannot be reasonably estimated since it depends on the timing and possible outcomes of tax examinations with various tax authorities. \nThe following table sets out the total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the components of the change in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year:\n \u2022 Technology and Administration Solutions - Our Technology and Administration Solutions (\u2018TAS') business provides benefits outsourcing services to clients outside of the U.S.  The table below presents segment commissions and fees and segment interest and other income for HCB for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe table below presents segment commissions and fees and segment interest and other income for HCB for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\n____________________\nDividends\nOn April 20, 2016, the Willis Towers Watson board reconfirmed, reapproved and reauthorized the remaining portion of the Legacy Willis program to repurchase the Company's ordinary shares on the open market or by way of redemption or otherwise.\nConstant Currency Change and Organic Change\nTotal costs of providing services were $7.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $128 million, or 2%. Total costs of providing services were $7.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $3.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $3.9 billion. See the analysis below for further information.\nThe Company is expecting to deliver $325 million of annual cost savings beginning in 2018. To achieve these savings, it has incurred cumulative restructuring charges of $441 million for the program since it began in the second quarter of 2014.\nIf the Company was required to perform Step 2, we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit used in Step 1 to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including any recognized or unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then the implied fair value of goodwill would be compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine if goodwill is impaired. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not record any impairment losses of goodwill or intangibles.\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, except per share data)\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as U.S. Tax Reform. U.S. Tax Reform makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to: (1) requiring a one-time transition tax on certain unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that may be payable over eight years; (2) bonus depreciation that will allow for a full expensing of qualified property; (3) reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; (4) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (\u2018GILTI'), which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits (\u2018FTCs') and a deduction of up to 50% to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (5) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (6) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (7) limitations on the use of FTCs to reduce the U.S. income tax liability; (8) the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax (\u2018BEAT'), a new minimum tax; and (9) a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries.\nBeginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affect our segment results. These changes, which are detailed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017, include the realignment of certain businesses within our segments, as well as changes to certain allocation methodologies to better reflect the ongoing nature of our businesses. The prior period comparatives reflected in the tables below have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. See Note 4 - Segment Information within Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of these changes.\n \u25e6 continuing to modernize the way we run our business to better serve our clients, enable the skills of our staff, and lower our costs of doing business; \nThe determination of the Company's obligations and annual expense under the plans is based on a number of assumptions that, given the longevity of the plans, are long-term in focus. A change in one or a combination of these assumptions could have a material impact on our projected benefit obligation. However, certain of these changes, such as changes in the discount rates and other actuarial assumptions, are not recognized immediately in net income, but are instead recorded in other comprehensive income. The accumulated gains and losses not yet recognized in net income are amortized into net income as a component of the net periodic benefit cost/(credit) based on the average working life expectancy of each of the plan's active participants to the extent that the net gains or losses as of the beginning of the year exceed 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation.\nCRB total segment and commissions and fees revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $2.5 billion, compared to pro forma $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. The growth for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to the acquisition of Gras Savoye, which occurred on December 29, 2015. International organic revenue declined as a result of lower revenues in Asia and Australasia, partially offset by better performance in Latin America and CEEMEA. Offsetting the International decline was Great Britain's organic growth as a result of solid revenue increases across all lines of business. Western Europe contributed to organic growth with strong revenue gains in Iberia, partially offset by softness in Italy. North America was flat with strong retention offset by lower new business.\n(ii) We have not presented this measure on a comparative basis with 2015 because it is not practical to present the 2015 adjusted income tax rate on a pro forma basis, as making tax-effected non-GAAP adjustments on a proforma basis would be highly speculative in nature.\nOther operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, a decrease of $17 million. The decrease was due primarily to the Stanford litigation provision of $50 million in 2016, partially offset by reserves for the City of Houston and CalPERS litigations and increases in other litigation reserves and professional services in 2017. Other operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $1.6 billion and $718 million, respectively, an increase of $833 million. The increase was primarily driven by the Merger and our acquisition of Gras Savoye.\nPension Assumptions\nNet income attributable to Willis Towers Watson\n\nExecutive Summary\nCommitments, Contingencies and Accrued Liabilities\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nAt December 31, 2017, there are no material elements of U.S. Tax Reform for which the Company's accounting is complete. While the Company's accounting for the following elements of U.S. Tax Reform is incomplete, the Company was able to make reasonable estimates of certain effects. Accordingly, the Company recorded provisional adjustments for the following significant items:\nSee Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussions of risks that may affect our ability to compete.\n b. Conforming reclassifications and adjustments. Certain reclassifications have been made to amounts in the Towers Watson historical statement of operations to conform to Willis' presentation, including reclassifying certain contra revenue accounts and Towers Watson's professional and subcontracted services, occupancy and general and administrative expenses within the relevant Willis captions. \nThe Company is authorized to repurchase shares, by way of redemption, and will consider whether to do so from time to time, based on many factors, including market conditions.\nAmortization\nCash flows from operating activities were $862 million for 2017, compared to cash flows from operating activities of $933 million for 2016. The $862 million net cash from operating activities for 2017 included net income of $592 million, adjusted for $548 million of non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $278 million. The $548 million non-cash adjustments primarily include depreciation, amortization, and the benefit from deferred income taxes. The $71 million decrease in cash from operations in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily resulted from changes in working capital and higher discretionary compensation payments made in 2017 for the 2016 compensation cycle. These discretionary compensation payments were lower in 2016 because they included only a partial payment to Legacy Towers Watson colleagues due to the timing of the Merger.\nto measure deferred tax assets at the amount considered realizable in future periods if the Company's facts and assumptions change. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and the results of recent financial operations. We place more reliance on evidence that is objectively verifiable.\nInvestment, Risk and Reinsurance (\u2018IRR')\nAs Reported Segment Revenues\nContractual Obligations\nIn order to assist readers of our consolidated financial statements in understanding the core operating results that Willis Towers Watson's management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning purposes, we present the following non-GAAP measures and their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure:\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nA reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and a reconciliation of the reported change to the constant currency and organic changes for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the prior year is as follows:\n____________________\n____________________\nIndefinite reinvestment assertion - Beginning in 2018, U.S. Tax Reform provides a 100% deduction for dividends received from 10-percent owned foreign corporations by U.S. corporate shareholders, subject to a one-year holding period. Although dividend income is now exempt from U.S. federal tax for U.S. corporate shareholders, companies must still account for the tax consequences of outside basis differences and other tax impacts of their investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. As a result of U.S. Tax Reform we have analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a repatriation and have determined that we may repatriate up to $219 million, the majority of which was previously deemed indefinitely reinvested. For those investments from which we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of such repatriation, we have recorded a provisional estimate for foreign withholding and state income taxes of $1 million. In addition, we re-measured the existing deferred tax liability accrued on certain acquired Towers Watson subsidiaries and released the deferred tax liability relating to the outside basis difference. This resulted in an income tax benefit of $76 million as these foreign earnings were subject to the one-time transition tax which reduced the outside basis difference.\nIn applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, with the remainder recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of October 1, and whenever indicators of impairment arise. The fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of October 1, and whenever indicators of impairment arise.\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $738 million compared to $551 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $187 million, or 34%. This increase resulted primarily from additional revenue of $315 million driven by growth across all segments, partially offset by additional costs resulting primarily from our integration activities and additional salary and benefits costs. Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $551 million compared to $427 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $124 million or 29%. The growth in income from operations compared to that of 2015 was primarily driven by the Merger and our acquisition of Gras Savoye.\nAdjusted Revenues\n \u2022 Talent & Rewards - Our Talent & Rewards (\u2018T&R') business provides advice, data, software and products to address clients' total rewards and talent issues. \nThis discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u2018SEC'). We present such non-GAAP financial measures, specifically, adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Company's operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent under U.S. GAAP, and these provide a measure against which our businesses may be assessed in the future.\nLegacy Miller - The plan provides retirement benefits based on members' salaries at the point at which they ceased to accrue benefits under the scheme.\n e. Depreciation. Adjustment related to depreciation on internally developed software of $57 million partially offset by an increase of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in the estimated fair value for leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and computer hardware and software. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nA reconciliation of net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nSee \u2018Non-GAAP Financial Measures' below for further discussion of our adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures.\nIncome from Operations\nIncome Taxes\nThere are no expiration dates for these repurchase plans or programs. The following table presents specified information about the Company's repurchases of ordinary shares for the year ended December 31, 2017:\nNet cash from financing activities in 2015 was $640 million, primarily due to $469 million net drawings on the revolving credit facility, a $592 million term loan draw down to fund the acquisition of Gras Savoye, and the issuance of shares of $131 million, partially offset by dividends paid of $277 million and repurchase of shares of $82 million.\n____________________\n\n \u2022 Benefits Accounts (formerly Consumer-Directed Accounts) - This business uses its SaaS-based technology and related services to deliver consumer-driven healthcare and reimbursement accounts, including health savings accounts, health reimbursement arrangements and other consumer-directed accounts.  The table below presents segment commissions and fees, and segment interest and other income for BDA for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n(i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.\n \u2022 Portfolio and Underwriting Services - Portfolio and Underwriting Services acts on behalf of our insurance carrier partners and self-insured entities in product marketing and distribution, risk underwriting and selection, claims management and other general administrative responsibilities. \nFiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity; such funds are not available to service the Company's debt or for other corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds.\nThe following table sets out the total revenues generated for the year ended December 31, 2016, pro forma revenues generated for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the components of the change for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the pro forma prior year.\nSee the \u2018Supplementary Pro Forma Segment Revenues' section below for additional discussion of our 2016 results.\nCash flows used in financing activities for 2017 were $479 million. The significant financing activities included the payment of $177 million related to the cancellation of Towers Watson shares in connection with the settlement of the Merger-related appraisal demand lawsuit (consisting of the portion of the settlement equal to the value of consideration that would have been\nTransaction and integration expenses were $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $147 million compared to $30 million for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in 2016 is primarily due to integration expenses incurred subsequent to the Merger. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately $162 million of these\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the following adjustments:\nmanagement and changed when appropriate. A discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved, whereas the expected long-term return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long term target asset allocations are revised. To calculate the discount rate, we use the granular approach to determining service cost and interest cost. We began using this method to calculate the discount rate in 2016. This was treated as a change in accounting estimate, and resulted in a credit of $51 million included in our total net periodic benefit income. The expected rate of return assumptions for all plans are supported by an analysis of the weighted-average yield expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments. Other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality, and the expected long-term rate of compensation and pension increases.\n\nIRR commissions and fees and total segment revenues for both years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $1.5 billion. Total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 included \u00a328 million ($41 million) received for a settlement related to the Fine Arts, Jewellery and Specie Team. Wholesale Insurance Broking, Investment, Insurance Consulting and Technology, Max Matthiessen and Willis Re all posted commissions and fees revenue growth, primarily as a result of strong sales and increased performance fees. Willis Towers Watson Securities growth was flat. The reduction in Portfolio and Underwriting Services commissions and fees was driven by a loss of profit commissions following the Atlantic hurricanes, the cancellation of a key contract, and the divestiture of small programs in the portfolio.\nSalaries and Benefits\n(i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.\n \u25e6 Revenue recognition for certain other revenue streams has changed from recognizing revenue at a point in time to recognizing revenue over time. Specifically, certain arrangements in our Health and Benefits broking business will now be recognized evenly over the year to reflect the nature of the ongoing obligations to our customers as well as receipt of the monthly commissions. These contracts are monthly or annual in nature and are considered complete as of the transition date. Therefore, no retained earnings adjustment is required. \nSalaries and Benefits\n i. Willis ordinary shares issuance. Approximately 184 million Willis ordinary shares (prior to the reverse stock split) were issued to Towers Watson stockholders as the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger, based on Towers Watson shares of common stock outstanding as of January 4, 2016, at a per share price of $47.18, which was the closing share price on that date, for a total value of approximately $8.7 billion. \nThe following table sets out the components of BDA revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the pro forma prior year.\nCash flows from operating activities were $933 million for 2016, compared to cash flows of from operating activities of $244 million for 2015. The $933 million net cash from operating activities for 2016 included net income of $438 million, adjusted for $590 million of non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $95 million. The $590 million of non-cash adjustments primarily include depreciation, amortization, net defined benefit pension credits, share-based compensation, and the benefit from deferred income taxes. The $689 million increase in cash from operations in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to cash from operations from Legacy Towers Watson and Gras Savoye.\nWillis Towers Watson sees that a unified approach to people and risk can be a path to growth for our clients.

As a result, and due to the global and diverse nature of our business, we view rates in the aggregate.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) adjusted for provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, significant litigation settlements, significant pension settlement and curtailment activity, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, loss/(gain) on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results.\n d. Rent. Adjustment to eliminate $5 million of historical rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 offset by $1 million amortization of our favorable and unfavorable lease agreements. \n (ii) We have not presented this measure on a comparative pro forma basis because it is not practical to present the 2015 adjusted income tax effects on a pro forma basis, as making tax-effected non-GAAP adjustments on a proforma basis would be highly speculative in nature.  Adjusted Income Before Taxes and Adjusted Income Taxes/Tax Rate\n\nIncluded within cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are amounts held for regulatory capital adequacy requirements, including $90 million and $87 million, respectively, held within our regulated U.K. entities.\nRestructuring Programs\n \u2022 Underpinning this growth through continuous operational improvement initiatives that help make us more effective and efficient and drive cost synergies. We do this by: \nHCB total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3.1 billion; commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $3.1 billion, compared with pro forma $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing an increase of $63 million to total segment revenues and an increase of $62 million to commissions and fees. Pro forma and constant currency revenue growth were driven by the acquisition of Gras Savoye, which occurred on December 29, 2015. In an effort to align resources and market demand, a significant restructuring across all lines of business took place during the second half of 2016, which caused disruption in our billable hours. Across the segment, performance was mixed, resulting in flat organic growth. Retirement revenues declined slightly as a result of reduced actuarial consulting, primarily in the fourth quarter. The Health and Benefits North America consulting business continued to see demand for plan design projects and increased product revenue. The Talent and Rewards advisory business was down period-over-period as the M&A market softened. The Technology and Administration Solutions Great Britain business had strong performance, led by increased project and administration activity along with new clients. Internationally, Global Wealth Solutions has been negatively impacted by adverse conditions in the Greater China market.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.9 billion, compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $130 million, or 7%. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was largely due to revenue growth across all segments partially offset by higher salary and benefits costs. The prior year also included settlement income of \u00a328 million ($41 million) related to the Fine Arts, Jewellery and Specie team.\nUnited States\n____________________\nNet income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $568 million, an increase of $148 million compared to $420 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by an improvement of $187 million in income from operations partially offset by a $34 million increase to expense in other expense/(income), net. Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $420 million, an increase of $47 million compared to $373 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The growth was primarily driven by an improvement of $124 million in income from operations and an increase of $63 million in the benefit from income taxes, partially offset by a $42 million increase in interest expense and an $82 million increase to expense in other expense/(income), net.\nWe are continuing our integration of Legacy Willis and Legacy Towers Watson, creating a unified platform for global growth, including positioning the Company to leverage our mutual distribution strength to enhance market penetration, expand our global footprint and create a strong platform for further innovation.\ntime transition tax liability for its foreign subsidiaries owned by U.S. corporate shareholders, resulting in an increase in U.S. federal income tax expense of $70 million and state income tax expense of $2 million. The Company has a significant number of foreign subsidiaries and therefore has not yet completed its calculation of the total post-1986 E&P as well as non-U.S. income taxes paid for these foreign subsidiaries. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets, including trade receivables based on estimates. The Company expects to revise its estimates of E&P, non-U.S. income taxes and cash balances throughout 2018 when actual results are available. In addition, guidance may be released which could also impact these estimates.\nAs an intermediary, we hold funds, generally in a fiduciary capacity, for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from, clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both Fiduciary assets and Fiduciary liabilities on our balance sheets.\nManagement has considered the U.K. referendum vote on June 23, 2016 to depart from the E.U., the triggering of Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon (providing the right to and procedures for a member to leave the E.U.) on March 29, 2017, the early general election held on June 8, 2017, and the uncertainties about the near-term and longer-term effects of Brexit on the Company. The terms of Brexit, and its impact, are highly uncertain. For a further discussion of the risks of Brexit to the Company, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 Benefits Outsourcing (formerly Technology and Administration Solutions) - Through our proprietary BenefitConnect technology, this business provides a broad suite of health and welfare outsourcing services as well as decision support and modeling tools for pension users within the U.S. \n \u2022 Health and Benefits - The Health & Benefits (\u2018H&B') business provides plan management consulting, broking and administration across the full spectrum of health and group benefit programs, including medical, dental, disability, life and other coverage. \n \u2022 Property and Casualty - Property and Casualty provides property and liability insurance brokerage services across a wide range of industries including construction, real estate, healthcare, and natural resources. \nThe organic change presented above includes the reduction to revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue made during purchase accounting for the Merger. If this revenue had not been reduced, the constant currency change would have been an increase of 9% and the organic change would have been an increase of 2%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIndebtedness\nOur cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 totaled $1.0 billion, compared to $870 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in cash from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the strengthening of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly the Pound sterling and Euro and less net debt payments made in the current year.\nIn addition to the shares reported in the table above, the Company canceled 1,415,199 Towers Watson common shares at issue in the settlement of the Merger-related appraisal demand lawsuit (see Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies located within Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information) and an equivalent number of ordinary shares represented in the Company's issued and outstanding share count up until the settlement date. As a result, the litigation settlement and related share cancellation had a similar impact to a share repurchase in that it reduced the number of outstanding shares of the Company. However, it did not impact the remaining authority under the share repurchase program.\nPro Forma Adjustments\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets - Impairment Review\n j. Earnings per share. The pro forma consolidated basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 are calculated as follows: \nThe following table details our top five markets based on percentage of consolidated revenues (in U.S. dollars) from the countries where work is performed for the year ended December 31, 2017. These figures do not represent the currency of the related revenue, which is presented in the table below.\nWe consider adjusted EBITDA to be an important financial measure, which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations, to benchmark our operating results against our competitors, and to evaluate and measure our performance-based compensation plans.\n \u2022 Gain on re-measurement of equity interests - The Company recognized a gain as a result of re-measuring its prior equity interest in Gras Savoye held before the business combination in 2015.  These non-GAAP measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the information contained within our consolidated financial statements.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.8 billion, compared to pro forma $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $89 million. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by our acquisition of Gras Savoye, the settlement with JLT of \u00a328 million ($41 million) related to the Fine Art, Jewellery and Specie team, and the performance of our Benefits Delivery and Administration segment.\nCRB total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $2.5 billion, compared to $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $198 million or 8%. The growth for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of Gras Savoye, which occurred on December 29, 2015. Great Britain led organic growth with solid revenue increases across all lines of business. Western Europe contributed to organic growth with strong growth in Iberia, partially offset by softness in Italy. North America was flat with strong retention offset by lower new business. International organic revenue declined as a result of lower revenues in Asia and Australasia, partially offset by better performance in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (\u2018CEEMEA').\nLegacy Towers Watson - Benefit accruals earned under the Legacy Watson Wyatt defined benefit plan (predominantly pension benefits) ceased on February 28, 2015, although benefits earned prior to January 1, 2008 retain a link to salary until the employee leaves the Company. Benefit accruals earned under the legacy Towers Perrin defined benefit plan (predominantly lump sum benefits) were frozen on March 31, 2008. All participants now accrue defined contribution benefits.\n (i) These percentages exclude certain expenses for significant items which will not be settled in cash, or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations. These items include Merger-related amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs, and transaction and integration expenses.  The following table sets forth the total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the components of the change in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year:\nThe HCB segment provides services through four business units:\n____________________\nA reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma 2015, and a reconciliation of the pro forma change to the constant currency and organic changes for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the prior year is as follows:\n\n\nPlease see the discussion in the \u2018As Reported Consolidated Financial Information' section above.\ndue to the shareholders at the closing of the Merger if they had exchanged their shares; see Part II, Item 8. Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings for additional information), share repurchases of $532 million and dividend payments of $277 million, which were partially offset by net borrowings of $580 million.\nOther expense/(income), net, includes other gains and losses, including gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other expense/(income), net, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $27 million of net expense, which was primarily foreign currency transaction losses. Other expense/(income), net for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015 was $112 million of net income, which was primarily due to $80 million of gains on disposals of operations and $59 million in the gain on the re-measurement of equity interests, partially offset by $30 million in foreign currency transaction losses in 2015.\n \u25e6 Additionally, the revenue recognition for proportional treaty broking commissions has moved from recognition upon the receipt of the monthly or quarterly statements, to the recognition of an estimate of expected commissions upon the policy effective date. Since the majority of revenue recognized historically based on these monthly or quarterly statements was received over a two-year period, we will reflect an adjustment to retained earnings at the adoption date for the portion of revenue that would otherwise have been recognized during our 2018 calendar year related to policies effective in 2017 or prior. \nAs Reported Consolidated Financial Information\nDiscretionary Compensation\n\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, diluted. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors.\n \u2022 Transition Tax - The table above excludes a $72 million provisional transition tax payable resulting from U.S. Tax Reform. The Company can and will elect to pay this one-time tax liability over an eight-year period without interest. The one-time transition tax cannot be reasonably estimated because the Company has a significant number of foreign subsidiaries and therefore has not yet completed its calculation of the total post-1986 E&P as well as non-U.S. income taxes paid for these foreign subsidiaries. The Company expects to revise its estimates throughout 2018 when actual results become available. Future guidance may be released which could also impact these estimates. \n(i) Includes pro forma adjustments made in the Supplementary Pro Forma Financial Information section in this Form 10-K.\n \u25e6 Certain revenue streams have accelerated revenue recognition timing. In particular, the revenue recognition for our Individual Marketplace (formerly Retiree & Access Exchanges) has moved from monthly ratable recognition over the policy period, to the recognition upon placement of the policy. Consequently, the Company will now recognize the majority of one calendar year of expected commissions during its fourth quarter of the preceding calendar year. Therefore, at the adoption date, we have reflected an adjustment to retained earnings for the portion of the revenue that would otherwise have been recognized during our 2018 calendar year since our earnings process was largely completed during the fourth quarter of 2017. \nGILTI - U.S. Tax Reform creates a new requirement that certain income (i.e., GILTI) earned by controlled foreign corporations (\u2018CFCs') must be included currently in the gross income of the CFCs' U.S. shareholder. GILTI is the excess of the shareholder's \u2018net CFC tested income' over the net deemed tangible income return, which is currently defined as the excess of (1) 10 percent of the aggregate of the U.S. shareholder's pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder over (2) the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net CFC-tested income. Because of the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, the Company is continuing to evaluate this provision of U.S. Tax Reform and the application of ASC 740. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the \u2018period cost method') or (2) factoring such amounts into a company's measurement of its deferred taxes (the \u2018deferred method'). The Company's selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new GILTI tax rules will depend, in part, on analyzing its global income of its CFCs to determine whether it expects to have future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI and, if so, what the impact is expected to be. Because whether the Company expects to have future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI depends on not only its current structure and estimated future results of global operations but also its intent and ability to modify its structure and/or its business, the Company is not yet able to reasonably estimate the effect of this provision of U.S. Tax Reform. Therefore, it has not made any adjustments related to potential GILTI tax in its consolidated financial statements and has not made a policy decision.\nSalaries and benefits for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were $4.7 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, an increase of $99 million. The increase was primarily a result of a $36 million pension settlement charge related to our U.K. pension plan as well as higher incentive accruals as compared to the prior year. Salaries and benefits for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $4.6 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, an increase of $2.3 billion. The increase in expenses was primarily driven by the Merger and our acquisition of Gras Savoye. As a percentage of revenues, salaries and benefits expenses represented 58%, 59% and 60% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nHuman Capital and Benefits\nWhile we are still in the process of analyzing the various Accounting Standards Updates (\u2018ASU') issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u2018FASB'), those which we believe will have a material impact to our financial statements are listed below. See Note 2 - Basis of Presentation, Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nNet Income Attributable to Willis Towers Watson\nInvestment, Risk and Reinsurance\nTotal debt, total equity, and the capitalization ratio at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were as follows:\n____________________\n \u2022 Financial Lines - Financial Lines specializes in brokerage services for financial, political and credit risks. \nAdministration, formerly Exchange Solutions, segments. See our segment revenues analysis for a further discussion of our segment results.\n\nBusiness Overview\nThe table below presents segment commissions and fees and segment interest and other income for CRB for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nLegacy Willis - This plan was frozen in 2009. Approximately one-quarter of the Legacy Willis employees in the United States have a frozen accrued benefit under this plan.\nThe following table sets out the components of CRB revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the pro forma prior year.\n\nOn January 4, 2016, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated June 29, 2015, as amended on November 19, 2015, between Willis, Towers Watson, and Citadel Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willis formed for the purpose of facilitating this transaction (\u2018Merger Sub'), Merger Sub merged with and into Towers Watson, with Towers Watson continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willis.\n\nOther operating expenses include occupancy, legal, marketing, licenses, royalties, supplies, technology, printing and telephone costs, as well as insurance, including premiums on excess insurance and losses on professional liability claims, non-client-reimbursed travel by colleagues, publications, professional subscriptions and development, recruitment, other professional fees and irrecoverable value added and sales taxes.\nThe following table sets out the components of HCB revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pro forma revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the pro forma prior year.\n____________________\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the clients' failure to pay for the services after the services have been rendered, including allowances when client disputes may exist. The related provision is recorded as a reduction to revenue. Our allowance policy is based on the aging of the billed and unbilled client receivables and has been developed based on the write-off history. Facts and circumstances such as the average length of time the receivables are past due, general market conditions, current economic trends and our clients' ability to pay may cause fluctuations in our valuation of billed and unbilled receivables.\nAmortization includes amortization of acquired intangible assets, including acquired internally developed software. Amortization was $591 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $56 million, or 10%, compared to $535 million for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in amortization in 2016 is primarily due to amortization of the intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions of Gras Savoye and Miller. We acquired approximately $231 million and $440 million in intangible assets in our acquisitions of Miller and Gras Savoye, respectively. These intangible assets are amortized over their expected lives which range from 4 to 25 years. See Note 3 - Merger, Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 8 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our intangible assets.\n c. Pension and post-retirement benefit amortization. Adjustments to remove the net periodic benefit costs of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 associated with the amortization of net actuarial losses and prior service credits/costs for Towers Watson's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. \nDefinitions of Constant Currency Change and Organic Change are included in the section entitled \u2018Non-GAAP Financial Measures' elsewhere within this Form 10-K.\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $8.2 billion, compared to $7.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $315 million or 4%. This growth in revenues was driven by strong performances in all segments.\n\n \u25e6 Although we are still finalizing the impact to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018, we expect the total range of adjustment, before the effect of taxes, to be an increase to retained earnings of $375 million to $475 million. \nWe operate in attractive markets - both growing and mature - with a diversified platform across geographies, industries, segments and lines of business. We aim to create and become the premier advisory, broking and solutions company of choice globally. We design and deliver solutions that manage risk, optimize benefits, cultivate talent, and expand the power of capital to protect and strengthen institutions and individuals. We also help organizations improve performance through effective people, risk and financial management by focusing on providing human capital and financial consulting services.\nWe consider adjusted operating income to be an important financial measure, which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors.\nCash flows used in investing activities for 2017 were $335 million, largely driven by $375 million of capital expenditures and capitalized software costs.\nDue to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, commission revenues may vary widely between accounting periods. A period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a \u2018soft' or \u2018softening' market, generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. A \u2018hard' or \u2018firming' market, during which premium rates rise, generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. Rates, however, vary by geography,\nAdditionally in March 2017, the Company repaid the 6.200% senior notes due 2017 totaling $407 million, including accrued interest.\nThe Merger affects the comparability of this data between 2015 and other periods presented. See \u2018Supplementary Pro Forma Financial Information' for additional analysis.\nFree Cash Flow\nAlso on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\u2018SAB 118'), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the U.S. Tax Reform. SAB 118 provides for a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the U.S. Tax Reform enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under Accounting Standards Codification (\u2018ASC') 740, Income Taxes (\u2018ASC 740'). In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of U.S. Tax Reform for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. Adjustments to incomplete and unknown amounts will be recorded and disclosed prospectively during the measurement period. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform.\n \u2022 Group Marketplace (formerly Active Exchanges) - This business is focused on delivering group benefit exchanges, serving the active employees of employers across the United States through our proprietary BenefitConnect or Bright Choices exchange platforms. \nBeginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affect our segment results. These changes, which are detailed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017, include the realignment of certain businesses within our segments, as well as changes to certain allocation methodologies to better reflect the ongoing nature of our businesses. The prior period comparatives reflected in the tables below have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. See Note 4 - Segment Information within Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of these changes.\n \u2022 Restructuring costs and transaction and integration expenses - Management believes it is appropriate to adjust for restructuring costs and transaction and integration expenses when they relate to a specific significant program with a defined set of activities and costs that are not expected to continue beyond a defined period of time, or one-time Merger-related transaction expenses. We believe the adjustment is necessary to present how the Company is performing, both now and in the future when these programs will have concluded. \nBDA total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $654 million, compared to pro forma $487 million for the year ended December 31, 2015; and commissions and fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $652 million, compared to pro forma $484 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Individual Marketplace commissions and fees increased by 41%, primarily as a result of the record 2016 annual enrollment season. The rest of the segment commissions and fees increased by 27%, primarily due to Benefits Outsourcing adding new clients and experiencing higher project activity.\nOne-time transition tax - The one-time transition tax is based on the Company's total post-1986 earnings and profits (\u2018E&P') that it previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The Company recorded a provisional amount for the one-\nMarket Conditions\n\nWe believe we can achieve this by:\nAdjusted income taxes/tax rate is defined as the provision for/(benefit from) income taxes adjusted for taxes on certain items of amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, significant litigation settlements, significant pension\n\n \u2022 Individual Marketplace (formerly Retiree & Access Exchanges) - This business provides solutions through a proprietary technology platform, OneExchange Retiree, which enables our employer clients to transition their retirees to individual, defined contribution health plans that provide individuals with a tax-free allowance or contribution to spend on healthcare services at an annual cost that the employer controls, as opposed to group-based, defined benefit health plans that provide groups of individuals with healthcare benefits at uncertain annual costs. \n(i) Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.\nApart from commitments, guarantees and contingencies, as disclosed herein and Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies located within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference, as of December 31, 2017, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\n a. Intercompany trading. Adjustments to eliminate trading between Legacy Willis and Legacy Towers Watson of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. \nAt the effective time of the Merger (the \u2018Effective Time'), each issued and outstanding share of Towers Watson common stock (the \u2018Towers Watson shares'), was converted into the right to receive 2.6490 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable ordinary shares of Willis (the \u2018Willis ordinary shares'), $0.000115 nominal value per share, other than any Towers Watson shares owned by Towers Watson, Willis or Merger Sub at the Effective Time and the Towers Watson shares held by stockholders who are entitled to, and who properly exercised, dissenter's rights under Delaware law.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nTransaction and integration expenses\nImmediately following the Merger, Willis effected (i) a consolidation (i.e., a reverse stock split under Irish law) of Willis ordinary shares whereby every 2.6490 Willis ordinary shares were consolidated into one Willis ordinary share ($0.000304635 nominal value per share) and (ii) an amendment to its constitution and other organizational documents to change its name from Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company to Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company.\n (i) Other includes salary and benefits, premises, and other expenses incurred to support the ongoing management and facilitation of the programs. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOur methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. These financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n____________________\n____________________\nMerger with Towers Watson\nUnited Kingdom\n\n \u25e6 making the necessary changes to our processes, our IT, our real estate and workforce locations; and \nWe derive the majority of our revenue from either commissions or fees for broking or consulting services. No single client represented a significant concentration of our consolidated revenues for any of the periods presented.\nThe Merger affects the comparability of this data between 2015 and other periods presented. See \u2018Supplementary Pro Forma Segment Revenues Analysis' for additional analysis.\nOther Expense/(Income), Net\n \u2022 Tax effects of internal reorganizations - Relates to the U.S. income tax expense resulting from the completion of internal reorganizations of the ownership of certain businesses that reduced the investments held by our U.S.-controlled subsidiaries. \nIRR total segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1.5 billion, compared to $896 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $638 million or 71%. This growth in revenues was driven by the Merger and a full year of revenues from Miller, following our acquisition in May 2015. See the \u2018Supplementary Pro Forma Segment Revenues' section below for additional discussion of our 2016 results.\nManagement believes the adjusted income tax rate presents a rate that is more closely aligned to the rate we would incur if not for the reduction of pre-tax income for the adjusted items, the tax effects of our internal reorganizations and the tax effect of U.S. Tax Reform, which are not core to our current and future operations.\nPension Contributions - The Company has agreed with Trustees of certain plans in the U.K. to contribute deficit funding and minimum ongoing accrual of benefits funding and presented those obligations in the table above. These obligations exclude employee contributions and any potential funding level contributions, which are dependent on future funding level assessments. There are no contractual obligations for our U.S. pension plans. Our total expected contributions to all qualified pension plans, including amounts presented above, for the year ending December 31, 2018 are projected to be $150 million. Additionally, the Company expects to pay $54 million in benefits directly to participants for the year ended 2018.\nInterest Expense\nSalaries and benefits were $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $215 million, or 5%, compared to $4.4 billion for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily related to our acquisitions of Gras Savoye and Miller, which contributed approximately $291 million of the increase, partially offset by increased net periodic benefit credits from the adoption of the granular approach to calculating service and interest costs of $51 million.\nWillis Towers Watson considers several factors prior to the start of each fiscal year when determining the appropriate annual assumptions, including economic forecasts, relevant benchmarks, historical trends, portfolio composition and peer company comparisons. These assumptions, used to determine our pension liabilities and pension expense are reviewed annually by senior\nThese consolidated financial statements conform to U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. The areas that we believe are critical accounting policies include valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients, discretionary compensation, income taxes, commitments, contingencies and accrued liabilities, pension assumptions, and goodwill and intangible assets. The critical accounting policies discussed below involve making difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. These critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate or assumption. Different estimates that we could have used, or changes in estimates that are reasonably likely to occur, may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the Company expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner, such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments. Beginning in 2016, as a result of our plan to restructure or distribute accumulated earnings of certain acquired Towers Watson foreign operations, we accrued deferred taxes on the historical and current year earnings of those subsidiaries. The historical cumulative earnings of our other subsidiaries had been reinvested indefinitely and therefore we had not provided deferred tax liabilities on these amounts. As a result of U.S. Tax Reform we have analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a repatriation. For those investments from which we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of such repatriation, we have recorded a provisional estimate for foreign withholding and state income taxes. In addition, we re-measured the existing deferred tax liability accrued on certain acquired Towers Watson subsidiaries and released the deferred tax liability relating to the outside basis difference. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital, long-term investment requirements or additional guidance relating to U.S. Tax Reform necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for income and foreign withholding taxes, net of credits, may be necessary. Other potential sources of cash may be through the settlement of intercompany loans or return of capital distributions in a tax-efficient manner.\nHCB is the largest segment of the Company, generating approximately 39% of our segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. HCB is focused on addressing our clients' people and risk needs to help them take on the challenges of operating in a global marketplace. HCB is further strengthened with teams of international consultants that provide support through each of our business units to the global headquarters of multinational clients and their foreign subsidiaries.\nThe Company's material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 are as follows:\nConsolidated Revenues\nIn the second quarter of 2016, we began planning targeted staffing reductions in certain portions of the business due to a reduction in business demand or change in business focus (hereinafter referred to as the Business Restructure Program). The main element of the program included workforce reductions, and was completed in 2016.\nCorporate Risk and Broking (\u2018CRB')\nLegacy Willis - This plan covers approximately one third of the Legacy Willis employees in the United Kingdom. The plan is now closed to new entrants. New employees in the United Kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan.\nSegment revenues exclude amounts that were directly incurred on behalf of our clients and reimbursed by them (reimbursed expenses); however, these amounts are included in consolidated revenues.\nOn November 10, 2016, the Company announced the board of directors approved an increase to the existing share repurchase program of $1 billion. The $1 billion increase was in addition to the remaining authority on the Legacy Willis program discussed in the preceding paragraph. At December 31, 2017, approximately $601 million remained on the current repurchase authority. The maximum number of shares that could be repurchased based on the closing price of our ordinary shares on December 31, 2017 of $150.69 was 3,986,473.\nOur results can be materially impacted by changes in currency conversions, which can fluctuate significantly over the course of a calendar year. For the year ended December 31, 2016, currency translation decreased our consolidated revenues by $202 million on a constant currency basis from the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015. The primary currency driving the change was the Pound sterling which weakened against the U.S. dollar during 2016.\nImpact of U.S. Tax Reform\nOur adjusted income tax rates were 21.9% and 20.8% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The lower adjusted tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a prior year tax benefit resulting from an enacted statutory tax rate reduction in the U.K.\n (i) Other includes salary and benefits, premises, and other expenses incurred to support the ongoing management and facilitation of the programs.  Business Restructuring Program\n\nAmortization\n \u2022 Venezuelan currency devaluation - Foreign exchange losses incurred as a consequence of the Venezuelan government's enforced changes to exchange rate mechanisms. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nGuarantees, Acquisition Liabilities and Other Contractual Obligations - Information regarding guarantees and other contractual obligations and their impact on the financial statements is set forth in Item 8, Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 ASU No. 2014-09 \u2018Revenue From Contracts With Customers' \nDepreciation represents the expense incurred over the useful life of our tangible fixed assets and internally developed software. Depreciation was $178 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $19 million, or 12%, compared to $159 million for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily related to our acquisitions of Gras Savoye and Miller and our normal capital expenditures.\nCRB operates as an integrated global team comprising both functional and geographic leadership with three global offerings:\n (i) As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 increased by $13 million and $1 million, respectively, increasing free cash flow by the same amount. See Item 8, Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of this Form 10-K report for a further discussion of this change.  The decrease in free cash flows in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily resulted from higher capital expenditures and higher discretionary compensation payments made in 2017 for the 2016 compensation cycle. These discretionary compensation payments were lower in 2016 because they included only a partial payment to Legacy Towers Watson colleagues due to the timing of the Merger.\nThe markets for our consulting, technology and solutions, and marketplace services are subject to changes as a result of economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, and increased competition from established and new competitors. We believe the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation, the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment, global scale, quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients' unique needs. With regard to the market for exchanges, we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients, a strong reputation for efficient execution and an innovative service delivery model and platform. Part of the employer sponsored insurance market has matured and become more fragmented while other segments remain in the entry phase. As these market segments continue to evolve, we may experience growth in intervals, with periods of accelerated expansion balanced by periods of modest growth.\nTotal costs of providing services were $7.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $6.7 billion for the pro forma year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $609 million or 9%.
