The real estate operations market involves real estate rental operations, leasing, secured financing of real estate and services provided for asset management, property management, property acquisitions, dispositions and development. Our current strategy is to invest in infill and central business district office properties in the United States sunbelt and mountain west regions as well as select opportunistic markets. We believe that the United States sunbelt and mountain west regions have macro-economic drivers that have the potential to increase occupancies and rents. We seek value-oriented investments with an eye towards long-term growth and appreciation, as well as current income.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 7.8 million square feet, or approximately 78% of our total owned portfolio, was located in Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Houston and Minneapolis. From time-to-time we may dispose of our smaller, suburban office assets and replace them with larger urban infill and central business district office assets. As we execute this strategy, short term operating results could be adversely impacted. However, we believe that the transformed portfolio has the potential to provide higher profit and asset value growth over a longer period of time.\nThe main factor that affects our real estate operations is the broad economic market conditions in the United States. These market conditions affect the occupancy levels and the rent levels on both a national and local level. We have no influence on broader economic/market conditions. We look to acquire and/or develop quality properties in good locations in order to lessen the impact of downturns in the market and to take advantage of upturns when they occur.\nTrends and Uncertainties\nEconomic Conditions\nThe economy in the United States is continuing to experience a period of economic growth, which directly affects the demand for office space, our primary income producing asset. The broad economic market conditions in the United States are affected by numerous factors, including but not limited to, inflation and employment levels, energy prices, the pace of economic growth and/or recessionary concerns, uncertainty about government fiscal, monetary, trade and tax policies, changes in currency exchange rates, geopolitical events, the regulatory environment, the availability of credit and interest rates. Any increase in interest rates could result in increased borrowing costs to us. However, we could also benefit from any further improved economic fundamentals and increasing levels of employment. We believe\nthat the economy is improving in many markets and appears to be in a broad-based upswing. However, future economic factors may negatively affect real estate values, occupancy levels and property income.\nReal Estate Operations\nLeasing\nAs of December 31, 2019, our real estate portfolio was comprised of 32 operating properties, which we refer to as our operating properties, and 3 redevelopment properties, which we refer to as our redevelopment properties, that are in the process of being redeveloped, or are completed but not yet stabilized. We collectively refer to our operating and our redevelopment properties as our owned portfolio. Our 32 operating properties were approximately 87.6% leased as of December 31, 2019, a decrease from 89.0% as of December 31, 2018. The 1.4% decrease in leased space was a result of the impact of lease expirations and terminations, which exceeded leasing completed during the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,175,000 square feet of vacancy in our operating properties compared to approximately 1,046,000 square feet of vacancy at December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we leased approximately 1,417,000 square feet of office space, of which approximately 883,000 square feet were with existing tenants, at a weighted average term of 8.3 years. On average, tenant improvements for such leases were $34.44 per square foot, lease commissions were $13.51 per square foot and rent concessions were approximately three months of free rent. Average GAAP base rents under such leases were $31.78 per square foot, or 10.9% higher than average rents in the respective properties as applicable compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our three redevelopment properties included an approximately 130,000 square foot redevelopment property known as 801 Marquette in Minneapolis, Minnesota, an approximately 213,000 square foot property known as Blue Lagoon in Miami, Florida and an approximately 62,000 square foot property known as Forest Park in Charlotte, North Carolina. Given the length of the redevelopment and lease-up process, these properties are not placed in service until, in some cases, years after we commence the project.\nThe redevelopment at 801 Marquette was substantially completed at the end of the second quarter of 2017 and is in the process of being leased up; however, it is not stabilized. As of December 31, 2019, we had leases signed and tenants occupying approximately 37.0% of the rentable square feet of the property. We expect to incur redevelopment and lease-up costs of $28.8 million, of which we had incurred approximately $23.0 million as of December 31, 2019.\nThe redevelopment of Blue Lagoon commenced in December 2018 following the maturity of a lease with a major tenant that occupied 100% of the property. On September 13, 2019, we entered into a lease agreement with a new tenant with an initial term of 16 years for approximately 156,000 square feet, or 73.1% of the property's rentable square feet. We expect to incur total restoration, redevelopment and lease-up costs of $38.9 million, which include work on the roof of the building, costs to make the space suitable for multiple tenants and to increase parking at the property. As of December 31, 2019, we had incurred approximately $8.7 million in total redevelopment costs. We anticipate completing the redevelopment by the end of 2020.\nThe redevelopment of Forest Park commenced in January 2019 following the maturity of a lease with a tenant that occupied 100% of the property through December 31, 2018. We expect to incur total redevelopment and lease-up costs of $4.4 million, which include interior work to make the space suitable for multiple tenants. As of December 31, 2019, we had incurred approximately $0.7 million in redevelopment costs. We anticipate completing the redevelopment by June 30, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2019, leases for approximately 7.7% and 8.1% of the square footage in our owned portfolio are scheduled to expire during 2020 and 2021, respectively. As the first quarter of 2020 begins, we believe that our operating properties are well stabilized, with a balanced lease expiration schedule, and that existing vacancy is being actively marketed to numerous potential tenants. We believe that most of our largest property markets are now experiencing generally steady or improving rental conditions. We are seeing increased potential leasing activity in the energy influenced market of Denver compared to the last several years. We anticipate positive leasing activity within our operating properties throughout 2020.\nWhile we cannot generally predict when an existing vacancy in our owned portfolio will be leased or if existing tenants with expiring leases will renew their leases or what the terms and conditions of the lease renewals will be, we expect to renew or sign new leases at then-current market rates for locations in which the buildings are located, which could be above or below the expiring rates. Also, we believe the potential for any of our tenants to default on its lease or to seek the protection of bankruptcy exists. If any of our tenants defaults on its lease, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment. In addition, at any time, a tenant of one of our properties may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws, which could result in the rejection and termination of such tenant's lease and thereby cause a reduction in cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nReal Estate Acquisition and Investment Activity\nDuring 2019:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>during the year ended December 31, 2019, we received approximately $1.1 million as full repayment of a Sponsored REIT Loan with FSP Satellite Place Corp.

The property was expected to sell within one year at a loss, which was\nrecorded as a provision for loss on a property held for sale of $20.5 million and was classified as an asset held for sale of $31.9 million at June 30, 2017. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we increased the provision for loss by $0.3 million to $20.7 million and the property was classified as an asset held for sale in the amount of $31.6 million at September 30, 2017. We sold the property on October 20, 2017 for net proceeds of $31.6 million resulting in a total loss of $20.8 million.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2016, we reached an agreement to sell an office property located in Milpitas, California. The property was classified as an asset held for sale at December 31, 2016 and was sold on January 6, 2017 at a $2.3 million gain.\nThe disposal of these properties did not represent a strategic shift that has a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. Accordingly, the properties remained classified within continuing operations for all periods presented.\nWe will continue to evaluate our portfolio, and in the future may decide to dispose of additional properties from time-to-time in the ordinary course of business. As an important part of our total return strategy, we intend to be active in property dispositions when we believe that we have maximized value and that market conditions warrant such activity and, as a consequence, we continuously review and evaluate our portfolio of properties for potentially advantageous dispositions.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe have certain critical accounting policies that are subject to judgments and estimates by our management and uncertainties of outcome that affect the application of these policies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. The accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations, and that require significant management estimates and judgments, are discussed below. Significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts, purchase price allocations, useful lives of fixed assets, impairment considerations and the valuation of derivatives.\nCritical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. We believe that our judgments and estimates are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations. Our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in Sponsored REITs and our investments in real property. These policies affect our:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>allocation of purchase price; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>allowance for doubtful accounts; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>assessment of the carrying values and impairments of long lived assets; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>useful lives of fixed assets and intangibles; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>valuation of derivatives; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>classification of leases; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>ownership of stock in a Sponsored REIT and related interests. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese policies involve significant judgments made based upon our experience, including judgments about current valuations, ultimate realizable value, estimated useful lives, salvage or residual value, the ability of our tenants to perform their obligations to us, current and future economic conditions and competitive factors in the markets in which our properties are located. Competition, economic conditions and other factors may cause occupancy declines in the future. In the future we may need to revise our carrying value assessments to incorporate information which is not now known and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own, result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets.\nAllocation of Purchase Price\nWe allocate the value of real estate acquired among land, buildings, improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities, which may consist of the value of above market and below market leases, the value of in-place leases, and the value of tenant relationships. Purchase price allocations and the determination of the useful lives are based on management's estimates. Under some circumstances we may rely upon studies commissioned from independent real estate appraisal firms in determining the purchase price allocations.\nPurchase price allocated to land and building and improvements is based on management's determination of the relative fair values of these assets assuming the property was vacant. Management determines the fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers. Purchase price allocated to above or below market leases is based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases including consideration of potential lease renewals and (ii) our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. This aggregate value is allocated between in-place lease values and tenant relationships based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease; however, the value of tenant relationships has not been separated from in-place lease value because such value and its consequence to amortization expense is immaterial for acquisitions reflected in our financial statements. Factors considered by us in performing these analyses include (i) an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, including real estate taxes, insurance and other operating income and expenses, and (ii) costs to execute similar leases in current market conditions, such as leasing commissions, legal and other related costs. If future acquisitions result in our allocating material amounts to the value of tenant relationships, those amounts would be separately allocated and amortized over the estimated life of the relationships.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on collectability. Lessors recognize the effect of a change in their assessment of whether the collectability of operating lease receivables are probable as an adjustment to lease income rather than bad debt expense.\nImpairment\nWe periodically evaluate our real estate properties for impairment indicators. These indicators may include declining tenant occupancy, weak or declining tenant profitability, cash flow or liquidity, our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or legislative, economic or market changes that permanently reduce the value of our investments. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the property by comparing it to its expected future undiscounted cash flows. If the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value, we reduce the net carrying value of the property to the present value of these expected future cash flows. This analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows. If we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future tenant profitability, market or industry factors differ from our expectations, we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate or fail to record a charge when we should have done so, or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nWe compute depreciation expense using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of up to 39 years for buildings and improvements, and up to 15 years for personal property. Costs incurred in connection with leasing (primarily tenant improvements and leasing commissions) are capitalized and amortized over the lease period. The allocated cost of land is not depreciated. The value of above or below-market leases is amortized over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases as an adjustment to rental income. The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is also amortized over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease are written off. Inappropriate allocation of acquisition costs, or incorrect estimates of useful lives, could result\nin depreciation and amortization expenses which do not appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods, as is required by generally accepted accounting principles.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe recognize derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that do not qualify, or are not designated as hedge relationships, must be adjusted to fair value through income. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability. To the extent hedges are effective, a corresponding amount, adjusted for swap payments, is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity. Amounts are then reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the derivatives' fair value is recognized directly into earnings as Other\u201d in our income statement. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. We currently have no fair value hedges outstanding. Fair values of derivatives are subject to significant variability based on changes in interest rates and counterparty credit risk. To the extent we enter into fair value hedges in the future, the results of such variability could be a significant increase or decrease in our derivative assets, derivative liabilities, book equity, and/or earnings.\nLease Classification\nSome of our real estate properties are leased on a triple net basis, pursuant to non-cancelable, fixed term, operating leases. Each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate whether it is appropriately classified as a capital lease or as an operating lease. The classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property, as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue. These evaluations require us to make estimates of, among other things, the remaining useful life and market value of a property, discount rates and future cash flows. Incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases.\nOwnership of Stock in a Sponsored REIT and Related Interests\nWe held preferred stock interests in two Sponsored REITs, both of which were liquidated during 2018. As a result of our common and preferred stock interests in these two Sponsored REITs, we exercised influence over, but did not control these entities. These preferred stock interests were accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting our cost basis was adjusted by our share of the Sponsored REITs' operations and distributions received. We also agreed to vote our preferred shares (i) with respect to any merger in the same manner that a majority of the other stockholders of the Sponsored REIT vote for or against the merger and (ii) with respect to any other matter presented to a vote by the stockholders of these Sponsored REITs in the same proportion as shares voted by other stockholders of that Sponsored REIT.\nThe equity investments in Sponsored REITS were reviewed for impairment each reporting period. The Company recorded impairment charges when events or circumstances indicate a decline in the fair value below the carrying value of the investment has occurred and such decline is other than temporary.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table shows financial results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 78: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 265,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 263,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related party revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management fees and interest income from loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,544)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 269,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 268,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 195\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate taxes and insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 94,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,321)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,617)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 262,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 262,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before taxes on income and equity in\nincome of non-consolidated REITs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax expense on income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (91)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in income of non-consolidated REITs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,793)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 13,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (6,594)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018\nRevenues\nTotal revenues increased by $0.2 million to $269.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.

The equity in income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of equity in income from our preferred stock investment in East Wacker of $7.2 million, which sold its property on September 24, 2018, and was partially offset by equity in loss from our preferred stock investment in Grand Boulevard of $0.1 million, which sold its property on July 19, 2018. In addition, during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, we recognized an impairment charge of $0.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, which represented the other-than-temporary decline in the fair value below the carrying value of the Company's investments in non-consolidated REITs.\nGains (loss) on sale of properties\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2016, we reached an agreement to sell an office property located in Milpitas, California. The property was classified as an asset held for sale at December 31, 2016 and was sold on January 6, 2017 at a $2.3 million gain. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we reached a decision to classify our office property located in Baltimore, Maryland as an asset held for sale. The property was expected to sell within one year at a loss, which was recorded as a provision for loss on a property held for sale of $20.5 million and the property was classified as an asset held for sale of $31.9 million at June 30, 2017. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we increased the provision for loss by $0.3 million to $20.7 million and the property was classified as an asset held for sale in the amount of $31.6 million at September 30, 2017. We sold the property on October 20, 2017 for net proceeds of $31.6 million resulting in a total loss of $20.8 million.\nOther\nOther expense of $1.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 was attributable to hedge ineffectiveness from our derivatives' fair value prior to October 18, 2017. The ineffective portion of the derivatives' fair value was recognized directly into earnings each quarter as hedge ineffectiveness.\nTaxes on income\nIncluded in income taxes is the Revised Texas Franchise Tax, a tax on revenues from Texas properties, which decreased $36,000 and federal and other income taxes decreased $4,000 for year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\nNet income (loss)\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $13.1 million compared to a net loss of $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, for the reasons described above.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFunds From Operations\nThe Company evaluates performance based on Funds From Operations, which we refer to as FFO, as management believes that FFO represents the most accurate measure of activity and is the basis for distributions paid to equity holders. The Company defines FFO as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, hedge ineffectiveness, acquisition costs of newly acquired properties that are not capitalized and lease acquisition costs that are not capitalized plus depreciation and amortization, including amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and impairment charges on properties or investments in non-consolidated REITs, and after adjustments to exclude equity in income or losses from, and, to include the proportionate share of FFO from, non-consolidated REITs.\nFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs.\nOther real estate companies and the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT may define this term in a different manner. We have included the NAREIT FFO definition as of May 17, 2016 in the table and note that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do.\nWe believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the results of the Company, FFO should be examined in connection with net income and cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe calculations of FFO are shown in the following table:\nTable 93: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 13,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (15,944)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Gain) loss on sale of properties and properties held for sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in income of non-consolidated REITs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,793)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO from non-consolidated REITs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAREIT FFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease Acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds From Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 97,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 102,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 111,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Operating Income (NOI)\nThe Company provides property performance based on NOI. Management believes that investors are interested in this information. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as net income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) plus general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, including amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and impairment charges, interest expense, less equity in earnings of nonconsolidated REITs, interest income, management fee income, hedge ineffectiveness, gains or losses on the sale of assets and excludes non-property specific income and expenses. The information presented includes footnotes and the data is shown by region with properties owned in both periods, which we call Same Store. The Comparative Same Store results include properties held for the periods presented and exclude properties that are non-operating, being developed or redeveloped, dispositions and significant nonrecurring income such as bankruptcy settlements and lease termination fees. NOI, as defined by the Company, may not be comparable to NOI reported by\nother REITs that define NOI differently. NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of the Company's liquidity or its ability to make distributions. The calculations of NOI are shown in the following table:\nTable 94: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

31, 2018, respectively. The decrease of $1.4 million is attributable to $81.9 million provided by operating activities, less $19.6 million used by investing activities and $63.7 million used in financing activities. Management believes that existing cash, cash anticipated to be generated internally by operations and our existing debt financing will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Although there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the funds necessary for our future growth, we anticipate generating funds from continuing real estate operations. We believe that we have adequate funds to cover unusual expenses and capital improvements, in addition to normal operating expenses. Our ability to maintain or increase our level of dividends to stockholders, however, depends in significant part upon the level of rental income from our real properties and our interest costs.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by our operating activities of $81.9 million is primarily attributable to net income of $6.5 million plus the add-back of $84.8 million of non-cash expenses, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $4.3 million, an increase in tenant security deposits of $3.0 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.3 million and a decrease in tenant rent receivables of $0.1 million. These increases were partially offset by a $15.1 million increase in payments of deferred leasing commissions and a $4.0 million increase in lease acquisition costs.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $19.6 million is primarily attributable to purchases of other real estate assets and office equipment investments of approximately $70.7 million and an investment in a related party mortgage receivable of $2.4 million. These uses were partially offset by repayments received from two related party mortgage receivables of $52.0 million and proceeds received from a liquidating trust of $1.5 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $63.7 million is primarily attributable to distributions paid to stockholders of $38.6 million, net repayments on the BAML Revolver (as defined below) of $25.0 million and an increase to deferred financing costs of $0.1 million.\nJPM Term Loan\nOn August 2, 2018, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and lender ( JPMorgan\u201d), and the other lending institutions party thereto (the JPM Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides a single unsecured bridge loan in the aggregate principal amount of $150 million (the JPM Term Loan\u201d) that remains fully advanced and outstanding. The JPM Term Loan matures on November 30, 2021. The JPM Term Loan was previously evidenced by a Credit Agreement, dated November 30, 2016, among the Company, JPMorgan, as administrative agent and lender, and the other lending institutions party thereto, as amended by a First Amendment, dated October 18, 2017.\nThe JPM Term Loan bears interest at either (i) a number of basis points over a LIBOR-based rate depending on the Company's credit rating (125.0 basis points over a LIBOR-based rate at December 31, 2019) or (ii) a number of basis points over the base rate depending on the Company's credit rating (25.0 basis points over the base rate at December 31, 2019).\nThe margin over the LIBOR-based rate or base rate is determined based on the Company's credit rating pursuant to the following grid:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR-BASED\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CREDIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RATE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BASE RATE\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LEVEL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RATING\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MARGIN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MARGIN\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>I\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>/\n</td> <td>A3 (or higher)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85.0\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>/\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90.0\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>III\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB\n</td> <td>/\n</td> <td>Baa2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>/\n</td> <td>Baa3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 125.0\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> <td> 25.0\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>V\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td><BBB-\n</td> <td>/\n</td> <td>Baa3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 165.0\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> <td> 65.0\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor purposes of the JPM Term Loan, base rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the greatest of: (i) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s prime rate in effect on such day, (ii) the greater of the Federal Funds Rate or the overnight bank funding rate in effect on such day, plus 0.50% (but no less than zero), and (iii) the one month Adjusted LIBOR based rate for a such day plus 1.00%. For purposes of the JPM Term Loan, the LIBOR-based rate means, for any interest period, the LIBOR rate for a period equal in length to the applicable interest period multiplied by the statutory reserve rate. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's credit rating from Moody's Investors Service was Baa3.\nAlthough the interest rate on the JPM Term Loan is variable under the JPM Credit Agreement, the Company fixed the LIBOR-based rate on a portion of the JPM Term Loan by entering into interest rate swap transactions. On March 7, 2019, the Company entered into ISDA Master Agreements with various financial institutions to hedge a $100 million portion of the future LIBOR-based rate risk under the JPM Credit Agreement. Effective March 29, 2019, the Company fixed the LIBOR-based rate at 2.44% per annum on a $100 million portion of the JPM Term Loan until November 30, 2021. Accordingly, based upon the Company's credit rating, as of December 31, 2019, the effective interest rate on a $100 million portion of the JPM Term Loan was 3.69% per annum.\nBased upon the Company's credit rating, as of December 31, 2019, the effective interest rate on the unhedged $50 million portion of the JPM Term Loan was 3.06% per annum. The weighted average interest rate on the unhedged $50 million portion of the JPM Term Loan during the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 3.54% per annum. The weighted average interest rate on the JPM Term Loan during the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 3.33% per annum.\nThe JPM Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers and acquisitions, disposition of assets, changes in business, certain restricted payments, the requirement to have subsidiaries provide a guaranty in the event that they incur recourse indebtedness and transactions with affiliates. The JPM Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio, and minimum unsecured interest coverage. The JPM Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, certain cross defaults and a change in control of the Company (as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement). In the event of a default by the Company, the administrative agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of lenders shall, declare all obligations under the JPM Credit Agreement immediately due and payable, and enforce any and all rights of the lenders or administrative agent under the JPM Credit Agreement and related documents. For certain events of default related to bankruptcy, insolvency, and receivership, all outstanding obligations of the Company will become immediately due and payable. We were in compliance with the JPM Term Loan financial covenants as of December 31, 2019.\nBMO Term Loan\nOn September 27, 2018, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement among the Company, the lending institutions party thereto and Bank of Montreal, as administrative agent (the BMO Credit Agreement\u201d). The BMO Credit Agreement provides for a single, unsecured term loan borrowing in the amount of $220 million (the BMO Term Loan\u201d) that remains fully advanced and outstanding. The BMO Term Loan consists of a $55\nmillion tranche A term loan and a $165 million tranche B term loan. The tranche A term loan matures on November 30, 2021 and the tranche B term loan matures on January 31, 2024. The BMO Credit Agreement also includes an accordion feature that allows up to $100 million of additional loans, subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of certain customary conditions.\nThe BMO Term Loan bears interest at either (i) a number of basis points over LIBOR depending on the Company's credit rating (125 basis points over LIBOR at December 31, 2019) or (ii) a number of basis points over the base rate depending on the Company's credit rating (25 basis points over the base rate at December 31, 2019).\nThe margin over LIBOR rate or base rate is determined based on the Company's credit rating pursuant to the following grid:\nTable 99: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CREDIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR RATE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BASE RATE\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LEVEL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RATING\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MARGIN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MARGIN\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>I\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A-\n</td> <td>/\n</td> <td>A3\n</td> <td> (or higher)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85.0\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB+\n</td> <td>/\n</td> <td>Baa1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 90.0\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>III\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB\n</td> <td>/\n</td> <td>Baa2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>/\n</td> <td>Baa3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 125.0\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> <td> 25.0\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>V\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td><BBB-\n</td> <td>/\n</td> <td>Baa3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 165.0\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> <td> 65.0\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor purposes of the BMO Term Loan, base rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of: (i) the bank's prime rate for such day, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate for such day, plus 0.50%, and (iii) the one month LIBOR based rate for such day plus 1.00%. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's credit rating from Moody's Investors Service was Baa3.\nAlthough the interest rate on the BMO Term Loan is variable under the BMO Credit Agreement, the Company fixed the base LIBOR interest rate by entering into interest rate swap transactions. On August 26, 2013, the Company entered into an ISDA Master Agreement with Bank of Montreal that fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BMO Term Loan at 2.32% per annum until August 26, 2020.

For certain events of default related to bankruptcy, insolvency, and receivership, the commitments of lenders will be automatically terminated and all outstanding obligations of the Company will become immediately due and payable. We were in compliance with the BMO Term Loan financial covenants as of December 31, 2019.\nBAML Credit Facility\nOn July 21, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment (the BAML First Amendment\u201d), and on October 18, 2017, the Company entered into a Second Amendment (the BAML Second Amendment\u201d), to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated October 29, 2014 among the Company, the lending institutions party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender (as amended by the BAML First Amendment and the BAML Second Amendment, the BAML Credit Facility\u201d) that continued an existing unsecured revolving line of credit (the BAML Revolver\u201d) and an existing term loan (the BAML Term Loan\u201d).\nBAML Revolver Highlights\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>The BAML Revolver is for borrowings, at the Company's election, of up to $600 million.

The BAML Credit Facility also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio, and minimum unsecured interest coverage. The BAML Credit Facility provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, certain cross defaults and a change in control of the Company (as defined in the BAML Credit Facility). In the event of a default by the Company, the administrative agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of lenders shall, declare all obligations under the BAML Credit Facility immediately due and payable, terminate the lenders' commitments to make loans under the BAML Credit Facility, and enforce any and all rights of the lenders or administrative agent under the BAML Credit Facility and related documents. For certain events of default related to bankruptcy, insolvency, and receivership, the commitments of lenders will be automatically terminated and all outstanding obligations of the Company will become immediately due and payable. We were in compliance with the BAML Credit Facility financial covenants as of December 31, 2019.\nThe Company may use the proceeds of the loans under the BAML Credit Facility to finance the acquisition of real properties and for other permitted investments; to finance investments associated with Sponsored REITs, to\nrefinance or retire indebtedness and for working capital and other general business purposes, in each case to the extent permitted under the BAML Credit Facility.\nSenior Notes\nOn October 24, 2017, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) with the various purchasers named therein (the Purchasers\u201d) in connection with a private placement of senior unsecured notes. Under the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to sell to the Purchasers an aggregate principal amount of $200,000,000 of senior unsecured notes consisting of (i) 3.99% Series A Senior Notes due December 20, 2024 in an aggregate principal amount of $116 million (the Series A Notes\u201d) and (ii) 4.26% Series B Senior Notes due December 20, 2027 in an aggregate principal amount of $84 million (the Series B Notes,\u201d and, together with the Series A Notes, the Senior Notes\u201d). On December 20, 2017, the Senior Notes were funded and proceeds were used to reduce the outstanding balance of the BAML Revolver.\nThe Note Purchase Agreement contains customary financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio. The Note Purchase Agreement also contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to enter into transactions with affiliates, merge, consolidate, create liens, make certain restricted payments, enter into certain agreements or prepay certain indebtedness. Such financial and restrictive covenants are substantially similar to the corresponding covenants contained in the BAML Credit Facility, the BMO Credit Agreement and the JPM Credit Agreement. The Senior Notes financial covenants require, among other things, the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50; a maximum leverage ratio and an unsecured leverage ratio of no more than 60% (65% if there were a significant acquisition for a short period of time). In addition, the Note Purchase Agreement provides that the Note Purchase Agreement will automatically incorporate additional financial and other specified covenants (such as limitations on investments and distributions) that are effective from time to time under the existing credit agreements, other material indebtedness or certain other private placements of debt of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, cross defaults with certain other indebtedness, breaches of covenants and bankruptcy events. In the case of an event of default, the Purchasers may, among other remedies, accelerate the payment of all obligations. We were in compliance with the Senior Notes financial covenants as of December 31, 2019.\nEquity Offering\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of our debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares. From time to time, we expect to issue debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares under our existing automatic shelf registration statements or a different registration statement to fund the acquisition of additional properties, to pay down any existing debt financing and for other corporate purposes.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, we may provide financing to Sponsored REITs in the form of a construction loan and/or a revolving line of credit secured by a mortgage. As of December 31, 2019, we had one loan outstanding for $21 million principal amount with one Sponsored REIT under such arrangements for the purpose of funding construction costs, capital expenditures, leasing costs or for other purposes. We anticipate that advances made under these facilities will be repaid at their maturity date or earlier from refinancing, long term financings of the underlying properties, cash flows from the underlying properties or another other capital event.\nWe may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Although occasional adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur, we believe that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe intend to draw on the BAML Credit Facility in the future for a variety of corporate purposes, including the acquisition of properties that we acquire directly for our portfolio and for Sponsored REIT Loans as described below.\nLoans to Sponsored REITs\nSponsored REIT Loans\nFrom time to time we may make secured loans ( Sponsored REIT Loans\u201d) to Sponsored REITs in the form of mortgage loans or revolving lines of credit to fund construction costs, capital expenditures, leasing costs and for other purposes. We anticipate that advances made under these facilities will be repaid at their maturity date or earlier from refinancing, long term financings of the underlying properties, cash flows from the underlying properties or another capital event. Each Sponsored REIT Loan is secured by a mortgage on the underlying property and has a term of approximately two to three years.\nOur Sponsored REIT Loans subject us to credit risk. However, we believe that our position as asset manager of each of the Sponsored REITs helps mitigate that risk by providing us with unique insight and the ability to rely on qualitative analysis of the Sponsored REITs. Before making a Sponsored REIT Loan, we consider a variety of subjective factors, including the quality of the underlying real estate, leasing, the financial condition of the applicable Sponsored REIT and local and national market conditions. These factors are subject to change and we do not apply a formula or assign relative weights to the factors. Instead, we make a subjective determination after considering such factors collectively.\nAdditional information about our Sponsored REIT Loans outstanding as of December 31, 2019, including a summary table of our Sponsored REIT Loans, is incorporated herein by reference to Note 3, Related Party Transactions and Investments in Non-Consolidated Entities - Management fees and interest income from loans\u201d, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nOther Considerations\nWe generally pay the ordinary annual operating expenses of our properties from the rental revenue generated by the properties. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, the rental income exceeded the expenses for each individual property, with the exception of one property located in Minneapolis, Minnesota for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and one property located in Houston, Texas for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOur property located at 801 Marquette Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota ( 801 Marquette Avenue\u201d) had approximately 170,000 square feet of rentable space and became vacant in January 2016. On June 30, 2016, we commenced a redevelopment plan for the property and substantially completed the redevelopment in the second quarter of 2017. Redevelopment of 801 Marquette Avenue resulted in approximately 129,800 of net rentable square feet for the property. As of December 31, 2019, we have signed leases with two tenants that now occupy 48,000 square feet, or 37% of rentable square feet at the property. As a result, we had rental income of $278,000 and operating expenses of $319,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2019. We had rental income of $750,000 and operating expenses of $1,158,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. We had rental income of $71,000 and had operating expenses of $302,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe property located in Houston, Texas has approximately 157,000 square feet of rentable space and became substantially vacant on April 30, 2017 when two tenants vacated 155,000 square feet of space. The property signed leases that commenced in 2019 for approximately 105,000 square feet, or 66.9% of the square feet of the property. We had rental income of $156,000 and had operating expenses of $1,484,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRental Income Commitments\nOur commercial real estate operations include the leasing of office buildings subject to leases with terms greater than one year. The leases thereon expire at various dates through 2036. Approximate undiscounted cash flows of rental income from non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2019 is:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

The amended lease expires on September 30, 2024 and has one five year renewal option. The lease includes a base annual rent and additional rent for our share of taxes and operating costs.\nIn addition to the amounts in the table above, from time to time, we may provide Sponsored REIT Loans to our Sponsored REITs. As of December 31, 2019, we had one Sponsored REIT Loan with $21 million principal amount outstanding. Additional information about our Sponsored REIT Loan outstanding as of December 31, 2019, including a summary table of our Sponsored REIT Loan, is incorporated herein by reference to Note 3, Related Party Transactions and Investments in Non-Consolidated Entities - Management fees and interest income from loans\u201d, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nInvestments in Sponsored REITs\nPreviously we operated in the investment banking segment, and in December 2011, we discontinued those activities. The investment banking segment involved the structuring of real estate investments and broker/dealer services that included the organization of Sponsored REITs, the acquisition and development of real estate on behalf of Sponsored REITs and the raising of capital to equitize the Sponsored REITs through sale of preferred stock in private placements. On December 15, 2011, we announced that our broker/dealer subsidiary, FSP Investments LLC, would no longer sponsor the syndication of shares of preferred stock in newly-formed Sponsored REITs. On July 15, 2014, FSP Investments LLC withdrew its registration as a broker/dealer with FINRA.\nThe Sponsored REITs own real estate, purchases of which were financed through the private placement of equity in those entities, typically through syndication. These Sponsored REITs are operated in a manner intended to qualify as real estate investment trusts. We earned fees related to the sale of preferred stock in the Sponsored REITs in these syndications. The Sponsored REITs issued both common stock and preferred stock. The common stock is owned by FSP Corp. Generally the preferred stock is owned by unaffiliated investors, however, we held an interest in preferred shares of two Sponsored REITs, which were liquidated during 2018. In addition, directors and officers of FSP Corp., have from time to time invested in Sponsored REITs. Following consummation of the offerings, the preferred stockholders in each of the Sponsored REITs were entitled to 100% of the Sponsored REIT's cash distributions. Subsequent to the completion of the offering of preferred shares, except for the preferred stock we previously owned, we do not share in any of the Sponsored REIT's earnings, or any related dividend, and the common stock ownership interests have virtually no economic benefit or risk.\nAs a common stockholder, we have no rights to the Sponsored REIT's earnings or any related cash distributions. However, upon liquidation of a Sponsored REIT, we are entitled to our percentage interest as a common stockholder in any proceeds remaining after the preferred stockholders have recovered their investment. Our common stock percentage interest in each Sponsored REIT is less than 1%. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Sponsored REIT's preferred stockholders is required for any actions involving merger, sale of property, amendment to charter or issuance of additional capital stock. In addition, all of the Sponsored REITs allow the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding preferred shares to remove (without cause) and replace one or more members of that Sponsored REIT's board of directors.\nWe previously acquired a preferred stock interest in three Sponsored REITs, including one that sold the property owned by it on September 24, 2018, one that sold the property owned by it on July 19, 2018 and one that sold the property owned by it on December 20, 2012 and each made a liquidating distribution to us; and one we acquired on May 15, 2008 by cash merger and another we acquired on April 30, 2006 by merger. As a result of our common stock interest and during the period we owned our preferred stock interests in the remaining two Sponsored REITs, we exercised influence over, but do not control these entities. These preferred share investments were accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting our cost basis was adjusted by our share of the Sponsored REITs' operations and distributions received. We also agreed to vote our preferred shares in any matter presented to a vote by the stockholders of these Sponsored REITs in the same proportion as shares voted by other stockholders of the Sponsored REITs.\nAt December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we held a common stock interest in 2, 3 and 6 Sponsored REITs, respectively, all of which were fully syndicated and in which we no longer share economic benefit or risk.\nFrom time to time, we may provide Sponsored REIT Loans to our Sponsored REITs. As of December 31, 2019, we had one Sponsored REIT Loan with $21 million principal amount outstanding. Additional information about our Sponsored REIT Loan outstanding as of December 31, 2019, including a summary table of our Sponsored REIT Loan, is incorporated herein by reference to Note 3, Related Party Transactions and Investments in Non-Consolidated Entities - Management fees and interest income from loans\u201d, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.", "item_7_truncated": "On August 2, 2018, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and lender ( JPMorgan\u201d), and the other lending institutions party thereto (the JPM Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides a single unsecured bridge loan in the aggregate principal amount of $150 million (the JPM Term Loan\u201d) that remains fully advanced and outstanding.

The JPM Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio, and minimum unsecured interest coverage. The JPM Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, certain cross defaults and a change in control of the Company (as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement).

Derivatives that do not qualify, or are not designated as hedge relationships, must be adjusted to fair value through income. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability. To the extent hedges are effective, a corresponding amount, adjusted for swap payments, is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity. Amounts are then reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the derivatives' fair value is recognized directly into earnings as Other\u201d in our income statement. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. We currently have no fair value hedges outstanding. Fair values of derivatives are subject to significant variability based on changes in interest rates and counterparty credit risk. To the extent we enter into fair value hedges in the future, the results of such variability could be a significant increase or decrease in our derivative assets, derivative liabilities, book equity, and/or earnings.\nThe disposal of these properties did not represent a strategic shift that has a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. Accordingly, the properties remained classified within continuing operations for all periods presented.\nRevenues\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOther expense of $1.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 was attributable to hedge ineffectiveness from our derivatives' fair value prior to October 18, 2017. The ineffective portion of the derivatives' fair value was recognized directly into earnings each quarter as hedge ineffectiveness.\nEquity in income of non-consolidated REITs\nWe compute depreciation expense using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of up to 39 years for buildings and improvements, and up to 15 years for personal property. Costs incurred in connection with leasing (primarily tenant improvements and leasing commissions) are capitalized and amortized over the lease period. The allocated cost of land is not depreciated. The value of above or below-market leases is amortized over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases as an adjustment to rental income. The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is also amortized over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease are written off. Inappropriate allocation of acquisition costs, or incorrect estimates of useful lives, could result\n \u25cf An increase in rental revenue of approximately $1.7 million arising primarily from increased termination fees for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, and rental income earned from leases commencing in 2019 and 2018, which was offset by the loss of rental income from leases that expired in 2019 and 2018.

and financing activities in the consolidated financial statements.\n \u25cf A decrease in real estate operating expenses of $0.5 million. \nNet Operating Income (NOI)\nThe BMO Term Loan bears interest at either (i) a number of basis points over LIBOR depending on the Company's credit rating (125 basis points over LIBOR at December 31, 2019) or (ii) a number of basis points over the base rate depending on the Company's credit rating (25 basis points over the base rate at December 31, 2019).\nFrom time to time we may make secured loans ( Sponsored REIT Loans\u201d) to Sponsored REITs in the form of mortgage loans or revolving lines of credit to fund construction costs, capital expenditures, leasing costs and for other purposes. We anticipate that advances made under these facilities will be repaid at their maturity date or earlier from refinancing, long term financings of the underlying properties, cash flows from the underlying properties or another capital event. Each Sponsored REIT Loan is secured by a mortgage on the underlying property and has a term of approximately two to three years.\nCritical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. We believe that our judgments and estimates are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations. Our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in Sponsored REITs and our investments in real property. These policies affect our:\nPurchase price allocated to land and building and improvements is based on management's determination of the relative fair values of these assets assuming the property was vacant. Management determines the fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers. Purchase price allocated to above or below market leases is based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases including consideration of potential lease renewals and (ii) our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. This aggregate value is allocated between in-place lease values and tenant relationships based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease; however, the value of tenant relationships has not been separated from in-place lease value because such value and its consequence to amortization expense is immaterial for acquisitions reflected in our financial statements. Factors considered by us in performing these analyses include (i) an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, including real estate taxes, insurance and other operating income and expenses, and (ii) costs to execute similar leases in current market conditions, such as leasing commissions, legal and other related costs. If future acquisitions result in our allocating material amounts to the value of tenant relationships, those amounts would be separately allocated and amortized over the estimated life of the relationships.\nWe previously acquired a preferred stock interest in three Sponsored REITs, including one that sold the property owned by it on September 24, 2018, one that sold the property owned by it on July 19, 2018 and one that sold the property owned by it on December 20, 2012 and each made a liquidating distribution to us; and one we acquired on May 15, 2008 by cash merger and another we acquired on April 30, 2006 by merger. As a result of our common stock interest and during the period we owned our preferred stock interests in the remaining two Sponsored REITs, we exercised influence over, but do not control these entities. These preferred share investments were accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting our cost basis was adjusted by our share of the Sponsored REITs' operations and distributions received. We also agreed to vote our preferred shares in any matter presented to a vote by the stockholders of these Sponsored REITs in the same proportion as shares voted by other stockholders of the Sponsored REITs.\nReal Estate Acquisition and Investment Activity\n\nRevenues\nCash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $19.6 million is primarily attributable to purchases of other real estate assets and office equipment investments of approximately $70.7 million and an investment in a related party mortgage receivable of $2.4 million. These uses were partially offset by repayments received from two related party mortgage receivables of $52.0 million and proceeds received from a liquidating trust of $1.5 million.\nWe held preferred stock interests in two Sponsored REITs, both of which were liquidated during 2018. As a result of our common and preferred stock interests in these two Sponsored REITs, we exercised influence over, but did not control these entities. These preferred stock interests were accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting our cost basis was adjusted by our share of the Sponsored REITs' operations and distributions received. We also agreed to vote our preferred shares (i) with respect to any merger in the same manner that a majority of the other stockholders of the Sponsored REIT vote for or against the merger and (ii) with respect to any other matter presented to a vote by the stockholders of these Sponsored REITs in the same proportion as shares voted by other stockholders of that Sponsored REIT.\nFSP Corp., or we or the Company, operates in a single reportable segment: real estate operations. The real estate operations market involves real estate rental operations, leasing, secured financing of real estate and services provided for asset management, property management, property acquisitions, dispositions and development. Our current strategy is to invest in infill and central business district office properties in the United States sunbelt and mountain west regions as well as select opportunistic markets. We believe that the United States sunbelt and mountain west regions have macro-economic drivers that have the potential to increase occupancies and rents. We seek value-oriented investments with an eye towards long-term growth and appreciation, as well as current income.\nAllocation of Purchase Price\nAs of December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding under the BAML Revolver. The BAML Revolver bears interest at either (i) a margin over LIBOR depending on the Company's credit rating (1.20% over LIBOR at December 31, 2019) or (ii) a margin over the base rate depending on the Company's credit rating (0.20% over the base rate at December 31, 2019). The BAML Credit Facility also obligates the Company to pay an annual facility fee in an amount that is also based on the Company's credit rating. The facility fee is assessed against the total amount of the BAML Revolver, or $600 million (0.25% at December 31, 2019). The amount of any applicable facility fee, and the margin over LIBOR rate or base rate is determined based on the Company's credit rating pursuant to the following grid.\n \u25cf on January 6, we received approximately $6.2 million in proceeds from the sale of a property located in Milpitas, California; \n \u25cf An increase in interest expense of approximately $6.0 million to $38.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to interest accruing on the Senior Notes (as defined below), which were issued on December 20, 2017 at a weighted average rate of approximately 4.10%, and used to reduce the outstanding balance on the BAML Revolver, a 0.19% increase in the average interest rate on the BAML Term Loan, higher short-term interest rates on the BAML Revolver and JPM Term Loan, and an increase in amortization of deferred financing costs during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017. \nthat the economy is improving in many markets and appears to be in a broad-based upswing. However, future economic factors may negatively affect real estate values, occupancy levels and property income.\nNet income (loss)\nThe margin over LIBOR rate or base rate is determined based on the Company's credit rating pursuant to the following grid:\nIncluded in income taxes is the Revised Texas Franchise Tax, a tax on revenues from Texas properties, which decreased $36,000 and federal and other income taxes decreased $4,000 for year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\n \u25cf An increase in real estate operating expenses and real estate taxes and insurance of approximately $3.6 million. \nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2017, we reached a decision to classify our office property located in Baltimore, Maryland as an asset held for sale. The property was expected to sell within one year at a loss, which was\nThese increases were partially offset by:\nRental Income Commitments\nOur Sponsored REIT Loans subject us to credit risk. However, we believe that our position as asset manager of each of the Sponsored REITs helps mitigate that risk by providing us with unique insight and the ability to rely on qualitative analysis of the Sponsored REITs. Before making a Sponsored REIT Loan, we consider a variety of subjective factors, including the quality of the underlying real estate, leasing, the financial condition of the applicable Sponsored REIT and local and national market conditions. These factors are subject to change and we do not apply a formula or assign relative weights to the factors. Instead, we make a subjective determination after considering such factors collectively.\nFor purposes of the BMO Term Loan, base rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of: (i) the bank's prime rate for such day, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate for such day, plus 0.50%, and (iii) the one month LIBOR based rate for such day plus 1.00%. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's credit rating from Moody's Investors Service was Baa3.\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of our debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares. From time to time, we expect to issue debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares under our existing automatic shelf registration statements or a different registration statement to fund the acquisition of additional properties, to pay down any existing debt financing and for other corporate purposes.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nItem 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn addition to the amounts in the table above, from time to time, we may provide Sponsored REIT Loans to our Sponsored REITs. As of December 31, 2019, we had one Sponsored REIT Loan with $21 million principal amount outstanding. Additional information about our Sponsored REIT Loan outstanding as of December 31, 2019, including a summary table of our Sponsored REIT Loan, is incorporated herein by reference to Note 3, Related Party Transactions and Investments in Non-Consolidated Entities - Management fees and interest income from loans\u201d, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nExpenses\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2016, we reached an agreement to sell an office property located in Milpitas, California. The property was classified as an asset held for sale at December 31, 2016 and was sold on January 6, 2017 at a $2.3 million gain. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we reached a decision to classify our office property located in Baltimore, Maryland as an asset held for sale. The property was expected to sell within one year at a loss, which was recorded as a provision for loss on a property held for sale of $20.5 million and the property was classified as an asset held for sale of $31.9 million at June 30, 2017. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we increased the provision for loss by $0.3 million to $20.7 million and the property was classified as an asset held for sale in the amount of $31.6 million at September 30, 2017. We sold the property on October 20, 2017 for net proceeds of $31.6 million resulting in a total loss of $20.8 million.\n (a) Nonrecurring Items in NOI include proceeds from bankruptcies, lease termination fees or other significant nonrecurring income or expenses, which may affect comparability. \nBAML Credit Facility General Information\n \u25cf The BAML Credit Facility includes an accordion feature that allows for an aggregate amount of up to $500 million of additional borrowing capacity applicable to the BAML Revolver and/or the BAML Term Loan, subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of certain customary conditions. \nAs of December 31, 2019, our three redevelopment properties included an approximately 130,000 square foot redevelopment property known as 801 Marquette in Minneapolis, Minnesota, an approximately 213,000 square foot property known as Blue Lagoon in Miami, Florida and an approximately 62,000 square foot property known as Forest Park in Charlotte, North Carolina. Given the length of the redevelopment and lease-up process, these properties are not placed in service until, in some cases, years after we commence the project.\n\n \u25cf A decrease in interest expense of approximately $1.6 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower debt outstanding, which was partially offset by higher interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. \nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated financial statements, including trends which might appear, should not be taken as necessarily indicative of future operations. The following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K may also contain forward-looking statements based on current judgments and current knowledge of management, which are subject to certain risks, trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that our forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty, including without limitation, economic conditions in the United States, changes in interest rates as a result of economic conditions or a downgrade in our credit rating, disruptions in the debt markets, economic conditions in the markets in which we own properties, risks of a lessening of demand for the types of real estate owned by us, uncertainties relating to fiscal policy, changes in government regulations and regulatory uncertainty, changes in energy prices, geopolitical events, and expenditures that cannot be anticipated such as utility rate and usage increases, unanticipated repairs, additional staffing, insurance increases and real estate tax valuation reassessments. See Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We may not update any of the forward-looking statements after the date this Annual Report on Form 10-K is filed to conform them to actual results or to changes in our expectations that occur after such date, other than as required by law.\nPreviously we operated in the investment banking segment, and in December 2011, we discontinued those activities. The investment banking segment involved the structuring of real estate investments and broker/dealer services that included the organization of Sponsored REITs, the acquisition and development of real estate on behalf of Sponsored REITs and the raising of capital to equitize the Sponsored REITs through sale of preferred stock in private placements. On December 15, 2011, we announced that our broker/dealer subsidiary, FSP Investments LLC, would no longer sponsor the syndication of shares of preferred stock in newly-formed Sponsored REITs. On July 15, 2014, FSP Investments LLC withdrew its registration as a broker/dealer with FINRA.\nCash and cash equivalents were $9.8 million and $11.2 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The decrease of $1.4 million is attributable to $81.9 million provided by operating activities, less $19.6 million used by investing activities and $63.7 million used in financing activities. Management believes that existing cash, cash anticipated to be generated internally by operations and our existing debt financing will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Although there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the funds necessary for our future growth, we anticipate generating funds from continuing real estate operations. We believe that we have adequate funds to cover unusual expenses and capital improvements, in addition to normal operating expenses. Our ability to maintain or increase our level of dividends to stockholders, however, depends in significant part upon the level of rental income from our real properties and our interest costs.\nWe intend to draw on the BAML Credit Facility in the future for a variety of corporate purposes, including the acquisition of properties that we acquire directly for our portfolio and for Sponsored REIT Loans as described below.\nThe BAML Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers and acquisitions, disposition of assets, changes in business, certain restricted payments, the requirement to have subsidiaries provide a guaranty in the event that they incur recourse indebtedness and transactions with affiliates. The BAML Credit Facility also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio, and minimum unsecured interest coverage. The BAML Credit Facility provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, certain cross defaults and a change in control of the Company (as defined in the BAML Credit Facility). In the event of a default by the Company, the administrative agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of lenders shall, declare all obligations under the BAML Credit Facility immediately due and payable, terminate the lenders' commitments to make loans under the BAML Credit Facility, and enforce any and all rights of the lenders or administrative agent under the BAML Credit Facility and related documents. For certain events of default related to bankruptcy, insolvency, and receivership, the commitments of lenders will be automatically terminated and all outstanding obligations of the Company will become immediately due and payable. We were in compliance with the BAML Credit Facility financial covenants as of December 31, 2019.\n \u25cf A decrease in rental revenue of approximately $3.5 million arising primarily from the loss of rental income from leases that expired in 2018 and 2017 and from the loss of revenue from properties that we sold on January 6, 2017 and October 20, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by rental income earned from leases commencing in 2018 and 2017. Our leased space in our operating properties decreased 0.7% to 89.0% at December 31, 2018 compared to 89.7% at December 31, 2017, lease expirations exceeding new leases signed and partially as a result of classification of two properties as redevelopment properties. \n\n (3) Amounts include prinicipal and interest payments. \n (4) Interest payments were estimated based on an interest rate swap with an effective interest rate of 3.69% per annum on $100 million as of December 31, 2019, and the variable rate in effect as of December 31, 2019, which was at an annual rate of 3.06% on $50 million as of December 31, 2019. \nThe JPM Term Loan bears interest at either (i) a number of basis points over a LIBOR-based rate depending on the Company's credit rating (125.0 basis points over a LIBOR-based rate at December 31, 2019) or (ii) a number of basis points over the base rate depending on the Company's credit rating (25.0 basis points over the base rate at December 31, 2019).\nDuring 2018:\nOur commercial real estate operations include the leasing of office buildings subject to leases with terms greater than one year. The leases thereon expire at various dates through 2036. Approximate undiscounted cash flows of rental income from non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2019 is:\nBAML Term Loan Highlights\nThe increase was partially offset by:\n\nThe following table shows financial results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nThe calculations of FFO are shown in the following table:\nLease Classification\nTaxes on income\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2016, we reached an agreement to sell an office property located in Milpitas, California. The property was classified as an asset held for sale at December 31, 2016 and was sold on January 6, 2017 at a $2.3 million gain.\nWe allocate the value of real estate acquired among land, buildings, improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities, which may consist of the value of above market and below market leases, the value of in-place leases, and the value of tenant relationships. Purchase price allocations and the determination of the useful lives are based on management's estimates. Under some circumstances we may rely upon studies commissioned from independent real estate appraisal firms in determining the purchase price allocations.\nLeasing\n \u25cf A decrease in interest income from Sponsored REIT loans of approximately $1.5 million primarily as a result of repayment of an outstanding loan by a Sponsored REIT of approximately $51 million in June 2019. \nBAML Credit Facility\nOther\nOn July 21, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment (the BAML First Amendment\u201d), and on October 18, 2017, the Company entered into a Second Amendment (the BAML Second Amendment\u201d), to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated October 29, 2014 among the Company, the lending institutions party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender (as amended by the BAML First Amendment and the BAML Second Amendment, the BAML Credit Facility\u201d) that continued an existing unsecured revolving line of credit (the BAML Revolver\u201d) and an existing term loan (the BAML Term Loan\u201d).\nWe will continue to evaluate our portfolio, and in the future may decide to dispose of additional properties from time-to-time in the ordinary course of business. As an important part of our total return strategy, we intend to be active in property dispositions when we believe that we have maximized value and that market conditions warrant such activity and, as a consequence, we continuously review and evaluate our portfolio of properties for potentially advantageous dispositions.\n \u25cf useful lives of fixed assets and intangibles; \nThe redevelopment of Blue Lagoon commenced in December 2018 following the maturity of a lease with a major tenant that occupied 100% of the property. On September 13, 2019, we entered into a lease agreement with a new tenant with an initial term of 16 years for approximately 156,000 square feet, or 73.1% of the property's rentable square feet. We expect to incur total restoration, redevelopment and lease-up costs of $38.9 million, which include work on the roof of the building, costs to make the space suitable for multiple tenants and to increase parking at the property. As of December 31, 2019, we had incurred approximately $8.7 million in total redevelopment costs. We anticipate completing the redevelopment by the end of 2020.\n (1) No principal was outstanding on the BAML Revolver as of December 31, 2019. \nOur property located at 801 Marquette Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota ( 801 Marquette Avenue\u201d) had approximately 170,000 square feet of rentable space and became vacant in January 2016. On June 30, 2016, we commenced a redevelopment plan for the property and substantially completed the redevelopment in the second quarter of 2017. Redevelopment of 801 Marquette Avenue resulted in approximately 129,800 of net rentable square feet for the property. As of December 31, 2019, we have signed leases with two tenants that now occupy 48,000 square feet, or 37% of rentable square feet at the property. As a result, we had rental income of $278,000 and operating expenses of $319,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2019. We had rental income of $750,000 and operating expenses of $1,158,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. We had rental income of $71,000 and had operating expenses of $302,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nWhile we cannot generally predict when an existing vacancy in our owned portfolio will be leased or if existing tenants with expiring leases will renew their leases or what the terms and conditions of the lease renewals will be, we expect to renew or sign new leases at then-current market rates for locations in which the buildings are located, which could be above or below the expiring rates. Also, we believe the potential for any of our tenants to default on its lease or to seek the protection of bankruptcy exists. If any of our tenants defaults on its lease, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment. In addition, at any time, a tenant of one of our properties may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws, which could result in the rejection and termination of such tenant's lease and thereby cause a reduction in cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nThe equity investments in Sponsored REITS were reviewed for impairment each reporting period. The Company recorded impairment charges when events or circumstances indicate a decline in the fair value below the carrying value of the investment has occurred and such decline is other than temporary.\nThe economy in the United States is continuing to experience a period of economic growth, which directly affects the demand for office space, our primary income producing asset. The broad economic market conditions in the United States are affected by numerous factors, including but not limited to, inflation and employment levels, energy prices, the pace of economic growth and/or recessionary concerns, uncertainty about government fiscal, monetary, trade and tax policies, changes in currency exchange rates, geopolitical events, the regulatory environment, the availability of credit and interest rates. Any increase in interest rates could result in increased borrowing costs to us. However, we could also benefit from any further improved economic fundamentals and increasing levels of employment. We believe\nFunds From Operations\n \u25cf valuation of derivatives; \nBMO Term Loan\n \u25cf A decrease in general and administrative expenses of $0.4 million as a result of decreases in personnel expenses. We had 38 employees as of February 7, 2019 and December 31, 2018, and 39 employees as of December 31, 2017. \nProperty Dispositions and Assets Held for Sale\n \u25cf A decrease in depreciation and amortization of approximately $7.0 million, which were primarily attributable to the disposition of two properties during 2017. \nThe BMO Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers and acquisitions, disposition of assets, changes in business, certain restricted payments, the requirement to have subsidiaries provide a guaranty in the event that they incur recourse indebtedness and transactions with affiliates. The BMO Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio, and minimum unsecured interest coverage. The BMO Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, certain cross defaults and a change in control of the Company (as defined in the BMO Credit Agreement). In the event of a default by the Company, the administrative agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of lenders shall, declare all obligations under the BMO Credit Agreement immediately due and payable, terminate the lenders' commitments to make loans under the BMO Credit Agreement, and enforce any and all rights of the lenders or administrative agent under the BMO Credit Agreement and related documents. For certain events of default related to bankruptcy, insolvency, and receivership, the commitments of lenders will be automatically terminated and all outstanding obligations of the Company will become immediately due and payable. We were in compliance with the BMO Term Loan financial covenants as of December 31, 2019.\n \u25cf during the year ended December 31, we received approximately $1.1 million in cash from Satellite Place, as partial prepayment of a Sponsored REIT Loan; and \n \u25cf allowance for doubtful accounts; \n \u25cf we received approximately $1.1 million in cash from Satellite Place, as partial prepayment of a Sponsored REIT Loan; \nEquity in income from non-consolidated REITs was $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. All of our investments in non-consolidated REITs were liquidated during 2018. The equity in income during the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of equity in income from our preferred stock investment in East Wacker of $7.2 million, which sold its property on September 24, 2018, and was partially offset by equity in loss from our preferred stock investment in Grand Boulevard of $0.1 million, which sold its property on July 19, 2018. In addition, for the three months ended June 30, 2018, we recognized an impairment charge of $0.3 million, which represented the other-than-temporary decline in the fair value below the carrying value of the Company's investments in non-consolidated REITs.\n \u25cf ownership of stock in a Sponsored REIT and related interests. \nOn October 24, 2017, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) with the various purchasers named therein (the Purchasers\u201d) in connection with a private placement of senior unsecured notes. Under the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to sell to the Purchasers an aggregate principal amount of $200,000,000 of senior unsecured notes consisting of (i) 3.99% Series A Senior Notes due December 20, 2024 in an aggregate principal amount of $116 million (the Series A Notes\u201d) and (ii) 4.26% Series B Senior Notes due December 20, 2027 in an aggregate principal amount of $84 million (the Series B Notes,\u201d and, together with the Series A Notes, the Senior Notes\u201d). On December 20, 2017, the Senior Notes were funded and proceeds were used to reduce the outstanding balance of the BAML Revolver.\nAs of December 31, 2019, leases for approximately 7.7% and 8.1% of the square footage in our owned portfolio are scheduled to expire during 2020 and 2021, respectively. As the first quarter of 2020 begins, we believe that our operating properties are well stabilized, with a balanced lease expiration schedule, and that existing vacancy is being actively marketed to numerous potential tenants. We believe that most of our largest property markets are now experiencing generally steady or improving rental conditions. We are seeing increased potential leasing activity in the energy influenced market of Denver compared to the last several years. We anticipate positive leasing activity within our operating properties throughout 2020.\nAlthough the interest rate on the BMO Term Loan is variable under the BMO Credit Agreement, the Company fixed the base LIBOR interest rate by entering into interest rate swap transactions. On August 26, 2013, the Company entered into an ISDA Master Agreement with Bank of Montreal that fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BMO Term Loan at 2.32% per annum until August 26, 2020. On February 20, 2019, the Company entered into ISDA Master Agreements with a group of banks that fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BMO Term Loan at 2.39% per annum for the period beginning on August 26, 2020 and ending January 31, 2024. Accordingly, based upon the Company's credit rating, as of December 31, 2019, the effective interest rate on the BMO Term Loan was 3.57% per annum.\nOverview\nFor purposes of the BAML Credit Facility, base rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of: (i) the bank's prime rate for such day, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate for such day, plus 0.50%, and (iii) the one month LIBOR based rate for such day plus 1.00%. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's credit rating from Moody's Investors Service was Baa3.\nEconomic Conditions\n \u25cf on July 19, 2018, an office property owned by a Sponsored REIT, FSP Grand Boulevard Corp. (Grand Boulevard) was sold to a third party. We held an equity investment in Grand Boulevard and received a liquidating distribution of its investment of $6.2 million on July 20, 2018. The Company received an initial cash distribution of $5.9 million from the liquidating trust of Grand Boulevard on August 17, 2018; and \nrefinance or retire indebtedness and for working capital and other general business purposes, in each case to the extent permitted under the BAML Credit Facility.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nmillion tranche A term loan and a $165 million tranche B term loan. The tranche A term loan matures on November 30, 2021 and the tranche B term loan matures on January 31, 2024. The BMO Credit Agreement also includes an accordion feature that allows up to $100 million of additional loans, subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of certain customary conditions.\nExpenses\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nContingencies\nrecorded as a provision for loss on a property held for sale of $20.5 million and was classified as an asset held for sale of $31.9 million at June 30, 2017. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we increased the provision for loss by $0.3 million to $20.7 million and the property was classified as an asset held for sale in the amount of $31.6 million at September 30, 2017. We sold the property on October 20, 2017 for net proceeds of $31.6 million resulting in a total loss of $20.8 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 7.8 million square feet, or approximately 78% of our total owned portfolio, was located in Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Houston and Minneapolis. From time-to-time we may dispose of our smaller, suburban office assets and replace them with larger urban infill and central business district office assets. As we execute this strategy, short term operating results could be adversely impacted. However, we believe that the transformed portfolio has the potential to provide higher profit and asset value growth over a longer period of time.\nResults of Operations\n \u25cf classification of leases; and \nCash provided by our operating activities of $81.9 million is primarily attributable to net income of $6.5 million plus the add-back of $84.8 million of non-cash expenses, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $4.3 million, an increase in tenant security deposits of $3.0 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.3 million and a decrease in tenant rent receivables of $0.1 million. These increases were partially offset by a $15.1 million increase in payments of deferred leasing commissions and a $4.0 million increase in lease acquisition costs.\n \u25cf On September 27, 2012, the Company drew down the entire $400 million under the BAML Term Loan and such amount remains fully advanced and outstanding under the BAML Term Loan. \nOwnership of Stock in a Sponsored REIT and Related Interests\nIncluded in income taxes is the Revised Texas Franchise Tax, which is a tax on revenues from Texas properties, which increased $75,000, and federal and other income taxes, which decreased by $166,000, during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of a refund arising due to the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nWe periodically evaluate our real estate properties for impairment indicators. These indicators may include declining tenant occupancy, weak or declining tenant profitability, cash flow or liquidity, our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or legislative, economic or market changes that permanently reduce the value of our investments. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the property by comparing it to its expected future undiscounted cash flows. If the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value, we reduce the net carrying value of the property to the present value of these expected future cash flows. This analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows. If we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future tenant profitability, market or industry factors differ from our expectations, we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate or fail to record a charge when we should have done so, or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate.\nFor purposes of the BAML Credit Facility, base rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of: (i) the bank's prime rate for such day, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate for such day, plus 0.50%, and (iii) the one month LIBOR based rate for such day plus 1.00%. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's credit rating from Moody's Investors Service was Baa3.\n\nBAML Revolver Highlights\nTotal revenues decreased by approximately $3.7 million to $268.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily a result of:\n \u25cf The BAML Term Loan matures on January 12, 2023. \nThe property located in Houston, Texas has approximately 157,000 square feet of rentable space and became substantially vacant on April 30, 2017 when two tenants vacated 155,000 square feet of space. The property signed leases that commenced in 2019 for approximately 105,000 square feet, or 66.9% of the square feet of the property. We had rental income of $156,000 and had operating expenses of $1,484,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nEquity in income from non-consolidated REITs is $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to equity in loss of $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The equity in income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of equity in income from our preferred stock investment in East Wacker of $7.2 million, which sold its property on September 24, 2018, and was partially offset by equity in loss from our preferred stock investment in Grand Boulevard of $0.1 million, which sold its property on July 19, 2018. In addition, during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, we recognized an impairment charge of $0.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, which represented the other-than-temporary decline in the fair value below the carrying value of the Company's investments in non-consolidated REITs.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $13.1 million compared to a net loss of $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, for the reasons described above.\n \u25cf Borrowings made pursuant to the BAML Revolver may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time until the maturity date of January12, 2022. The Company has the right to extend the maturity date of the BAML Revolver by two additional 6 month periods, or until January 12, 2023, upon payment of a fee and satisfaction of certain customary conditions. \nDuring 2019:\nSenior Notes\n \u25cf An increase in general and administrative expenses of $1.4 million, which was primarily attributable to personnel related expenses and lease acquisition costs. \nWe provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on collectability. Lessors recognize the effect of a change in their assessment of whether the collectability of operating lease receivables are probable as an adjustment to lease income rather than bad debt expense.\nTotal expenses decreased by $1.9 million to $262.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily a result of:\nAlthough the interest rate on the JPM Term Loan is variable under the JPM Credit Agreement, the Company fixed the LIBOR-based rate on a portion of the JPM Term Loan by entering into interest rate swap transactions. On March 7, 2019, the Company entered into ISDA Master Agreements with various financial institutions to hedge a $100 million portion of the future LIBOR-based rate risk under the JPM Credit Agreement. Effective March 29, 2019, the Company fixed the LIBOR-based rate at 2.44% per annum on a $100 million portion of the JPM Term Loan until November 30, 2021. Accordingly, based upon the Company's credit rating, as of December 31, 2019, the effective interest rate on a $100 million portion of the JPM Term Loan was 3.69% per annum.\nContractual Obligations\n (2) Amounts reflect a facility fee calculated as 0.0025% of the $600 million available to be drawn. \nThe main factor that affects our real estate operations is the broad economic market conditions in the United States. These market conditions affect the occupancy levels and the rent levels on both a national and local level. We have no influence on broader economic/market conditions. We look to acquire and/or develop quality properties in good locations in order to lessen the impact of downturns in the market and to take advantage of upturns when they occur.\n (5) The BAML Term Loan has an interest rate swap with an effective interest rate of 2.47% per annum as of December 31, 2019, which was used for estimating interest. The swap expires on September 27, 2021. Interest payments between September 27, 2021 and maturity were estimated based on the variable rate in effect as of December 31, 2019, which was at an annual rate of 3.11%. \nThese policies involve significant judgments made based upon our experience, including judgments about current valuations, ultimate realizable value, estimated useful lives, salvage or residual value, the ability of our tenants to perform their obligations to us, current and future economic conditions and competitive factors in the markets in which our properties are located. Competition, economic conditions and other factors may cause occupancy declines in the future. In the future we may need to revise our carrying value assessments to incorporate information which is not now known and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own, result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets.\nTax expense on income\nThe operating lease in the table above consists of our lease of corporate office space, which commenced September 1, 2010, and was amended on October 25, 2016. The amended lease expires on September 30, 2024 and has one five year renewal option. The lease includes a base annual rent and additional rent for our share of taxes and operating costs.\nLoans to Sponsored REITs\n \u25cf A decrease in depreciation and amortization of approximately $3.3 million. \nTotal expenses increased by $0.1 million to $262.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily a result of:\nImpairment\n \u25cf during the year ended December 31, 2019, we received approximately $1.1 million as full repayment of a Sponsored REIT Loan with FSP Satellite Place Corp. ( Satellite Place\u201d) and we received approximately $51 million as full repayment of a Sponsored REIT Loan with FSP Energy Tower I Corp.; \nAt December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we held a common stock interest in 2, 3 and 6 Sponsored REITs, respectively, all of which were fully syndicated and in which we no longer share economic benefit or risk.\nBased upon the Company's credit rating, as of December 31, 2019, the effective interest rate on the unhedged $50 million portion of the JPM Term Loan was 3.06% per annum. The weighted average interest rate on the unhedged $50 million portion of the JPM Term Loan during the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 3.54% per annum. The weighted average interest rate on the JPM Term Loan during the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 3.33% per annum.\n \u25cf The BAML Credit Facility includes an accordion feature that allows for an aggregate amount of up to $500 million of additional borrowing capacity to the BAML Revolver and/or the BAML Term Loan, subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of certain customary conditions. \nin depreciation and amortization expenses which do not appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods, as is required by generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe Note Purchase Agreement contains customary financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio. The Note Purchase Agreement also contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to enter into transactions with affiliates, merge, consolidate, create liens, make certain restricted payments, enter into certain agreements or prepay certain indebtedness. Such financial and restrictive covenants are substantially similar to the corresponding covenants contained in the BAML Credit Facility, the BMO Credit Agreement and the JPM Credit Agreement. The Senior Notes financial covenants require, among other things, the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50; a maximum leverage ratio and an unsecured leverage ratio of no more than 60% (65% if there were a significant acquisition for a short period of time). In addition, the Note Purchase Agreement provides that the Note Purchase Agreement will automatically incorporate additional financial and other specified covenants (such as limitations on investments and distributions) that are effective from time to time under the existing credit agreements, other material indebtedness or certain other private placements of debt of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, cross defaults with certain other indebtedness, breaches of covenants and bankruptcy events. In the case of an event of default, the Purchasers may, among other remedies, accelerate the payment of all obligations. We were in compliance with the Senior Notes financial covenants as of December 31, 2019.\nFrom time to time, we may provide financing to Sponsored REITs in the form of a construction loan and/or a revolving line of credit secured by a mortgage. As of December 31, 2019, we had one loan outstanding for $21 million principal amount with one Sponsored REIT under such arrangements for the purpose of funding construction costs, capital expenditures, leasing costs or for other purposes. We anticipate that advances made under these facilities will be repaid at their maturity date or earlier from refinancing, long term financings of the underlying properties, cash flows from the underlying properties or another other capital event.\n * Excludes NOI from investments in and interest income from secured loans to non-consolidated REITs. \n\n (6) The BMO Term Loan has an interest rate swap with an effective interest rate of 3.57% per annum as of December 31, 2019, which was used for estimating interest. The swap expires on August 26, 2020. Interest payments between August 26, 2020 and maturity have an interest swap with an effective interest rate of 3.64% per annum as of December 31, 2019, which was used for estimating interest. \nFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs.\nThe Sponsored REITs own real estate, purchases of which were financed through the private placement of equity in those entities, typically through syndication. These Sponsored REITs are operated in a manner intended to qualify as real estate investment trusts. We earned fees related to the sale of preferred stock in the Sponsored REITs in these syndications. The Sponsored REITs issued both common stock and preferred stock. The common stock is owned by FSP Corp. Generally the preferred stock is owned by unaffiliated investors, however, we held an interest in preferred shares of two Sponsored REITs, which were liquidated during 2018. In addition, directors and officers of FSP Corp., have from time to time invested in Sponsored REITs. Following consummation of the offerings, the preferred stockholders in each of the Sponsored REITs were entitled to 100% of the Sponsored REIT's cash distributions. Subsequent to the completion of the offering of preferred shares, except for the preferred stock we previously owned, we do not share in any of the Sponsored REIT's earnings, or any related dividend, and the common stock ownership interests have virtually no economic benefit or risk.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $6.5 million compared to net income of $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the reasons described above.\nOther Considerations\nFinancing Activities\nAdditional information about our Sponsored REIT Loans outstanding as of December 31, 2019, including a summary table of our Sponsored REIT Loans, is incorporated herein by reference to Note 3, Related Party Transactions and Investments in Non-Consolidated Entities - Management fees and interest income from loans\u201d, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\n \u25cf A decrease in interest income from loans to Sponsored REITs of approximately $0.1 million as a result of repayments of Sponsored REIT Loans, which was partially offset by higher interest rates in 2018 compared to 2017. \nThe Company may use the proceeds of the loans under the BAML Credit Facility to finance the acquisition of real properties and for other permitted investments; to finance investments associated with Sponsored REITs, to\n \u25cf assessment of the carrying values and impairments of long lived assets; \nGains (loss) on sale of properties\n\nWe have certain critical accounting policies that are subject to judgments and estimates by our management and uncertainties of outcome that affect the application of these policies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. The accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations, and that require significant management estimates and judgments, are discussed below. Significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts, purchase price allocations, useful lives of fixed assets, impairment considerations and the valuation of derivatives.\n \u25cf on June 7, we received approximately $9.0 million in cash from FSP 1441 Main Street Corp. as repayment in full of a Sponsored REIT Loan; \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\nother REITs that define NOI differently. NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of the Company's liquidity or its ability to make distributions. The calculations of NOI are shown in the following table:\nSome of our real estate properties are leased on a triple net basis, pursuant to non-cancelable, fixed term, operating leases. Each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate whether it is appropriately classified as a capital lease or as an operating lease. The classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property, as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue. These evaluations require us to make estimates of, among other things, the remaining useful life and market value of a property, discount rates and future cash flows. Incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases.\n \u25cf on October 20, we received approximately $31.6 million in proceeds from the sale of a property located in Baltimore, Maryland. \nThe Company evaluates performance based on Funds From Operations, which we refer to as FFO, as management believes that FFO represents the most accurate measure of activity and is the basis for distributions paid to equity holders. The Company defines FFO as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, hedge ineffectiveness, acquisition costs of newly acquired properties that are not capitalized and lease acquisition costs that are not capitalized plus depreciation and amortization, including amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and impairment charges on properties or investments in non-consolidated REITs, and after adjustments to exclude equity in income or losses from, and, to include the proportionate share of FFO from, non-consolidated REITs.\nSponsored REIT Loans\n \u25cf on February 2, 2019, we received a cash distribution of approximately $0.2 million from the liquidating trust of Grand Boulevard (defined below) and anticipate receiving additional liquidating distributions of approximately $0.1 million in the aggregate as the trust is liquidated; \nNet income\n \u25cf allocation of purchase price; \nAs of December 31, 2019, our real estate portfolio was comprised of 32 operating properties, which we refer to as our operating properties, and 3 redevelopment properties, which we refer to as our redevelopment properties, that are in the process of being redeveloped, or are completed but not yet stabilized. We collectively refer to our operating and our redevelopment properties as our owned portfolio. Our 32 operating properties were approximately 87.6% leased as of December 31, 2019, a decrease from 89.0% as of December 31, 2018. The 1.4% decrease in leased space was a result of the impact of lease expirations and terminations, which exceeded leasing completed during the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,175,000 square feet of vacancy in our operating properties compared to approximately 1,046,000 square feet of vacancy at December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we leased approximately 1,417,000 square feet of office space, of which approximately 883,000 square feet were with existing tenants, at a weighted average term of 8.3 years. On average, tenant improvements for such leases were $34.44 per square foot, lease commissions were $13.51 per square foot and rent concessions were approximately three months of free rent. Average GAAP base rents under such leases were $31.78 per square foot, or 10.9% higher than average rents in the respective properties as applicable compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe following table shows financial results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nEquity in income (loss) of non-consolidated REITs\n \u25cf A decrease in management fee income of approximately $0.1 million primarily as a result of the liquidation of three Sponsored REITs during 2018 and one Sponsored REIT during 2017. \nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018\nThe redevelopment at 801 Marquette was substantially completed at the end of the second quarter of 2017 and is in the process of being leased up; however, it is not stabilized. As of December 31, 2019, we had leases signed and tenants occupying approximately 37.0% of the rentable square feet of the property. We expect to incur redevelopment and lease-up costs of $28.8 million, of which we had incurred approximately $23.0 million as of December 31, 2019.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017\nThe Company provides property performance based on NOI. Management believes that investors are interested in this information. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as net income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) plus general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, including amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and impairment charges, interest expense, less equity in earnings of nonconsolidated REITs, interest income, management fee income, hedge ineffectiveness, gains or losses on the sale of assets and excludes non-property specific income and expenses. The information presented includes footnotes and the data is shown by region with properties owned in both periods, which we call Same Store. The Comparative Same Store results include properties held for the periods presented and exclude properties that are non-operating, being developed or redeveloped, dispositions and significant nonrecurring income such as bankruptcy settlements and lease termination fees. NOI, as defined by the Company, may not be comparable to NOI reported by\n \u25cf we have continued to actively explore additional potential real estate investment opportunities and anticipate further real estate investments in the future. \n \u25cf on September 24, 2018, an office property owned by a Sponsored REIT, FSP 303 East Wacker Drive Corp (East Wacker) was sold to a third party. We held an equity investment in East Wacker and received a liquidating distribution of its investment of $70.0 million on September 25, 2018. We received an initial cash distribution of $69.0 million from the liquidating trust of East Wacker on September 27, 2018. \nInvestments in Sponsored REITs\n\n \u25cf The BAML Revolver is for borrowings, at the Company's election, of up to $600 million. Borrowings made pursuant to the BAML Revolver may be revolving loans, swing line loans or letters of credit, the combined sum of which may not exceed $600 million outstanding at any time. \nThe redevelopment of Forest Park commenced in January 2019 following the maturity of a lease with a tenant that occupied 100% of the property through December 31, 2018. We expect to incur total redevelopment and lease-up costs of $4.4 million, which include interior work to make the space suitable for multiple tenants. As of December 31, 2019, we had incurred approximately $0.7 million in redevelopment costs. We anticipate completing the redevelopment by June 30, 2020.\n \u25cf on April 3, 2019 we received a cash distribution of approximately $1.0 million from the liquidating trust of East Wacker (defined below); and \nBased upon the Company's credit rating, as of December 31, 2019, the interest rate on the BAML Revolver was 2.96% per annum. The weighted average interest rate on all amounts outstanding on the BAML Revolver during the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 3.67% per annum. As of December 31, 2018, there were borrowings of $25 million outstanding under the BAML Revolver at an interest rate of 3.63% per annum. The weighted average interest rate on all amounts outstanding on the BAML Revolver during the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 3.09% per annum.\nAlthough the interest rate on the BAML Credit Facility is variable, the Company fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BAML Term Loan by entering into interest rate swap transactions. On July 22, 2016, the Company entered into ISDA Master Agreements with a group of banks that fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BAML Term Loan at 1.12% per annum for the period beginning on September 27, 2017 and ending on September 27, 2021. Accordingly, based upon the Company's credit rating, as of December 31, 2019, the effective interest rate on the BAML Term Loan was 2.47% per annum.\nAs a common stockholder, we have no rights to the Sponsored REIT's earnings or any related cash distributions. However, upon liquidation of a Sponsored REIT, we are entitled to our percentage interest as a common stockholder in any proceeds remaining after the preferred stockholders have recovered their investment. Our common stock percentage interest in each Sponsored REIT is less than 1%. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Sponsored REIT's preferred stockholders is required for any actions involving merger, sale of property, amendment to charter or issuance of additional capital stock. In addition, all of the Sponsored REITs allow the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding preferred shares to remove (without cause) and replace one or more members of that Sponsored REIT's board of directors.\nFrom time to time, we may provide Sponsored REIT Loans to our Sponsored REITs. As of December 31, 2019, we had one Sponsored REIT Loan with $21 million principal amount outstanding. Additional information about our Sponsored REIT Loan outstanding as of December 31, 2019, including a summary table of our Sponsored REIT Loan, is incorporated herein by reference to Note 3, Related Party Transactions and Investments in Non-Consolidated Entities - Management fees and interest income from loans\u201d, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.", "item_7_text": "On August 2, 2018, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and lender ( JPMorgan\u201d), and the other lending institutions party thereto (the JPM Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides a single unsecured bridge loan in the aggregate principal amount of $150 million (the JPM Term Loan\u201d) that remains fully advanced and outstanding. The JPM Term Loan matures on November 30, 2021. The JPM Term Loan was previously evidenced by a Credit Agreement, dated November 30, 2016, among the Company, JPMorgan, as administrative agent and lender, and the other lending institutions party thereto, as amended by a First Amendment, dated October 18, 2017.\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $63.7 million is primarily attributable to distributions paid to stockholders of $38.6 million, net repayments on the BAML Revolver (as defined below) of $25.0 million and an increase to deferred financing costs of $0.1 million.\nThe JPM Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers and acquisitions, disposition of assets, changes in business, certain restricted payments, the requirement to have subsidiaries provide a guaranty in the event that they incur recourse indebtedness and transactions with affiliates. The JPM Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio, and minimum unsecured interest coverage. The JPM Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, certain cross defaults and a change in control of the Company (as defined in the JPM Credit Agreement). In the event of a default by the Company, the administrative agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of lenders shall, declare all obligations under the JPM Credit Agreement immediately due and payable, and enforce any and all rights of the lenders or administrative agent under the JPM Credit Agreement and related documents. For certain events of default related to bankruptcy, insolvency, and receivership, all outstanding obligations of the Company will become immediately due and payable. We were in compliance with the JPM Term Loan financial covenants as of December 31, 2019.\n\nReal Estate Operations\nWe may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Although occasional adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur, we believe that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nOn September 27, 2018, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement among the Company, the lending institutions party thereto and Bank of Montreal, as administrative agent (the BMO Credit Agreement\u201d). The BMO Credit Agreement provides for a single, unsecured term loan borrowing in the amount of $220 million (the BMO Term Loan\u201d) that remains fully advanced and outstanding. The BMO Term Loan consists of a $55\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe generally pay the ordinary annual operating expenses of our properties from the rental revenue generated by the properties. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, the rental income exceeded the expenses for each individual property, with the exception of one property located in Minneapolis, Minnesota for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and one property located in Houston, Texas for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDerivative Instruments\nDuring 2017:\nFor purposes of the JPM Term Loan, base rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the greatest of: (i) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s prime rate in effect on such day, (ii) the greater of the Federal Funds Rate or the overnight bank funding rate in effect on such day, plus 0.50% (but no less than zero), and (iii) the one month Adjusted LIBOR based rate for a such day plus 1.00%. For purposes of the JPM Term Loan, the LIBOR-based rate means, for any interest period, the LIBOR rate for a period equal in length to the applicable interest period multiplied by the statutory reserve rate. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's credit rating from Moody's Investors Service was Baa3.\nTotal revenues increased by $0.2 million to $269.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily a result of:\nThe BAML Term Loan bears interest at either (i) a margin over LIBOR depending on the Company's credit rating (1.35% over LIBOR at December 31, 2019) or (ii) a margin over the base rate depending on the Company's credit rating (0.35% over the base rate at December 31, 2019). The margin over LIBOR rate or base rate is determined based on the Company's credit rating pursuant to the following grid:\nOther real estate companies and the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT may define this term in a different manner. We have included the NAREIT FFO definition as of May 17, 2016 in the table and note that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do.\n \u25cf The BAML Term Loan is for $400 million. \nWe recognize derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that do not qualify, or are not designated as hedge relationships, must be adjusted to fair value through income. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability. To the extent hedges are effective, a corresponding amount, adjusted for swap payments, is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity. Amounts are then reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the derivatives' fair value is recognized directly into earnings as Other\u201d in our income statement. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. We currently have no fair value hedges outstanding. Fair values of derivatives are subject to significant variability based on changes in interest rates and counterparty credit risk. To the extent we enter into fair value hedges in the future, the results of such variability could be a significant increase or decrease in our derivative assets, derivative liabilities, book equity, and/or earnings.\nThe disposal of these properties did not represent a strategic shift that has a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. Accordingly, the properties remained classified within continuing operations for all periods presented.\nRevenues\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOther expense of $1.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 was attributable to hedge ineffectiveness from our derivatives' fair value prior to October 18, 2017. The ineffective portion of the derivatives' fair value was recognized directly into earnings each quarter as hedge ineffectiveness.\nEquity in income of non-consolidated REITs\nWe compute depreciation expense using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of up to 39 years for buildings and improvements, and up to 15 years for personal property. Costs incurred in connection with leasing (primarily tenant improvements and leasing commissions) are capitalized and amortized over the lease period. The allocated cost of land is not depreciated. The value of above or below-market leases is amortized over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases as an adjustment to rental income. The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is also amortized over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease are written off. Inappropriate allocation of acquisition costs, or incorrect estimates of useful lives, could result\n \u25cf An increase in rental revenue of approximately $1.7 million arising primarily from increased termination fees for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, and rental income earned from leases commencing in 2019 and 2018, which was offset by the loss of rental income from leases that expired in 2019 and 2018. Our leased space in our operating properties was 87.6% at December 31, 2019 and 89.0% at December 31, 2018. \nEquity Offering\nJPM Term Loan\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nOperating Activities\nThe margin over the LIBOR-based rate or base rate is determined based on the Company's credit rating pursuant to the following grid:\nTrends and Uncertainties\nWe believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the results of the Company, FFO should be examined in connection with net income and cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities in the consolidated financial statements.\n \u25cf A decrease in real estate operating expenses of $0.5 million. \nNet Operating Income (NOI)\nThe BMO Term Loan bears interest at either (i) a number of basis points over LIBOR depending on the Company's credit rating (125 basis points over LIBOR at December 31, 2019) or (ii) a number of basis points over the base rate depending on the Company's credit rating (25 basis points over the base rate at December 31, 2019).\nFrom time to time we may make secured loans ( Sponsored REIT Loans\u201d) to Sponsored REITs in the form of mortgage loans or revolving lines of credit to fund construction costs, capital expenditures, leasing costs and for other purposes. We anticipate that advances made under these facilities will be repaid at their maturity date or earlier from refinancing, long term financings of the underlying properties, cash flows from the underlying properties or another capital event. Each Sponsored REIT Loan is secured by a mortgage on the underlying property and has a term of approximately two to three years.\nCritical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. We believe that our judgments and estimates are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations. Our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in Sponsored REITs and our investments in real property. These policies affect our:\nPurchase price allocated to land and building and improvements is based on management's determination of the relative fair values of these assets assuming the property was vacant. Management determines the fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers. Purchase price allocated to above or below market leases is based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases including consideration of potential lease renewals and (ii) our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. This aggregate value is allocated between in-place lease values and tenant relationships based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease; however, the value of tenant relationships has not been separated from in-place lease value because such value and its consequence to amortization expense is immaterial for acquisitions reflected in our financial statements. Factors considered by us in performing these analyses include (i) an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, including real estate taxes, insurance and other operating income and expenses, and (ii) costs to execute similar leases in current market conditions, such as leasing commissions, legal and other related costs. If future acquisitions result in our allocating material amounts to the value of tenant relationships, those amounts would be separately allocated and amortized over the estimated life of the relationships.\nWe previously acquired a preferred stock interest in three Sponsored REITs, including one that sold the property owned by it on September 24, 2018, one that sold the property owned by it on July 19, 2018 and one that sold the property owned by it on December 20, 2012 and each made a liquidating distribution to us; and one we acquired on May 15, 2008 by cash merger and another we acquired on April 30, 2006 by merger. As a result of our common stock interest and during the period we owned our preferred stock interests in the remaining two Sponsored REITs, we exercised influence over, but do not control these entities. These preferred share investments were accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting our cost basis was adjusted by our share of the Sponsored REITs' operations and distributions received. We also agreed to vote our preferred shares in any matter presented to a vote by the stockholders of these Sponsored REITs in the same proportion as shares voted by other stockholders of the Sponsored REITs.\nReal Estate Acquisition and Investment Activity\n\nRevenues\nCash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $19.6 million is primarily attributable to purchases of other real estate assets and office equipment investments of approximately $70.7 million and an investment in a related party mortgage receivable of $2.4 million. These uses were partially offset by repayments received from two related party mortgage receivables of $52.0 million and proceeds received from a liquidating trust of $1.5 million.\nWe held preferred stock interests in two Sponsored REITs, both of which were liquidated during 2018. As a result of our common and preferred stock interests in these two Sponsored REITs, we exercised influence over, but did not control these entities. These preferred stock interests were accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting our cost basis was adjusted by our share of the Sponsored REITs' operations and distributions received. We also agreed to vote our preferred shares (i) with respect to any merger in the same manner that a majority of the other stockholders of the Sponsored REIT vote for or against the merger and (ii) with respect to any other matter presented to a vote by the stockholders of these Sponsored REITs in the same proportion as shares voted by other stockholders of that Sponsored REIT.\nFSP Corp., or we or the Company, operates in a single reportable segment: real estate operations. The real estate operations market involves real estate rental operations, leasing, secured financing of real estate and services provided for asset management, property management, property acquisitions, dispositions and development. Our current strategy is to invest in infill and central business district office properties in the United States sunbelt and mountain west regions as well as select opportunistic markets. We believe that the United States sunbelt and mountain west regions have macro-economic drivers that have the potential to increase occupancies and rents. We seek value-oriented investments with an eye towards long-term growth and appreciation, as well as current income.\nAllocation of Purchase Price\nAs of December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding under the BAML Revolver. The BAML Revolver bears interest at either (i) a margin over LIBOR depending on the Company's credit rating (1.20% over LIBOR at December 31, 2019) or (ii) a margin over the base rate depending on the Company's credit rating (0.20% over the base rate at December 31, 2019). The BAML Credit Facility also obligates the Company to pay an annual facility fee in an amount that is also based on the Company's credit rating. The facility fee is assessed against the total amount of the BAML Revolver, or $600 million (0.25% at December 31, 2019). The amount of any applicable facility fee, and the margin over LIBOR rate or base rate is determined based on the Company's credit rating pursuant to the following grid.\n \u25cf on January 6, we received approximately $6.2 million in proceeds from the sale of a property located in Milpitas, California; \n \u25cf An increase in interest expense of approximately $6.0 million to $38.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to interest accruing on the Senior Notes (as defined below), which were issued on December 20, 2017 at a weighted average rate of approximately 4.10%, and used to reduce the outstanding balance on the BAML Revolver, a 0.19% increase in the average interest rate on the BAML Term Loan, higher short-term interest rates on the BAML Revolver and JPM Term Loan, and an increase in amortization of deferred financing costs during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017. \nthat the economy is improving in many markets and appears to be in a broad-based upswing. However, future economic factors may negatively affect real estate values, occupancy levels and property income.\nNet income (loss)\nThe margin over LIBOR rate or base rate is determined based on the Company's credit rating pursuant to the following grid:\nIncluded in income taxes is the Revised Texas Franchise Tax, a tax on revenues from Texas properties, which decreased $36,000 and federal and other income taxes decreased $4,000 for year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\n \u25cf An increase in real estate operating expenses and real estate taxes and insurance of approximately $3.6 million. \nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2017, we reached a decision to classify our office property located in Baltimore, Maryland as an asset held for sale. The property was expected to sell within one year at a loss, which was\nThese increases were partially offset by:\nRental Income Commitments\nOur Sponsored REIT Loans subject us to credit risk. However, we believe that our position as asset manager of each of the Sponsored REITs helps mitigate that risk by providing us with unique insight and the ability to rely on qualitative analysis of the Sponsored REITs. Before making a Sponsored REIT Loan, we consider a variety of subjective factors, including the quality of the underlying real estate, leasing, the financial condition of the applicable Sponsored REIT and local and national market conditions. These factors are subject to change and we do not apply a formula or assign relative weights to the factors. Instead, we make a subjective determination after considering such factors collectively.\nFor purposes of the BMO Term Loan, base rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of: (i) the bank's prime rate for such day, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate for such day, plus 0.50%, and (iii) the one month LIBOR based rate for such day plus 1.00%. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's credit rating from Moody's Investors Service was Baa3.\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of our debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares. From time to time, we expect to issue debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares under our existing automatic shelf registration statements or a different registration statement to fund the acquisition of additional properties, to pay down any existing debt financing and for other corporate purposes.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nItem 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn addition to the amounts in the table above, from time to time, we may provide Sponsored REIT Loans to our Sponsored REITs. As of December 31, 2019, we had one Sponsored REIT Loan with $21 million principal amount outstanding. Additional information about our Sponsored REIT Loan outstanding as of December 31, 2019, including a summary table of our Sponsored REIT Loan, is incorporated herein by reference to Note 3, Related Party Transactions and Investments in Non-Consolidated Entities - Management fees and interest income from loans\u201d, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nExpenses\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2016, we reached an agreement to sell an office property located in Milpitas, California. The property was classified as an asset held for sale at December 31, 2016 and was sold on January 6, 2017 at a $2.3 million gain. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we reached a decision to classify our office property located in Baltimore, Maryland as an asset held for sale. The property was expected to sell within one year at a loss, which was recorded as a provision for loss on a property held for sale of $20.5 million and the property was classified as an asset held for sale of $31.9 million at June 30, 2017. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we increased the provision for loss by $0.3 million to $20.7 million and the property was classified as an asset held for sale in the amount of $31.6 million at September 30, 2017. We sold the property on October 20, 2017 for net proceeds of $31.6 million resulting in a total loss of $20.8 million.\n (a) Nonrecurring Items in NOI include proceeds from bankruptcies, lease termination fees or other significant nonrecurring income or expenses, which may affect comparability. \nBAML Credit Facility General Information\n \u25cf The BAML Credit Facility includes an accordion feature that allows for an aggregate amount of up to $500 million of additional borrowing capacity applicable to the BAML Revolver and/or the BAML Term Loan, subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of certain customary conditions. \nAs of December 31, 2019, our three redevelopment properties included an approximately 130,000 square foot redevelopment property known as 801 Marquette in Minneapolis, Minnesota, an approximately 213,000 square foot property known as Blue Lagoon in Miami, Florida and an approximately 62,000 square foot property known as Forest Park in Charlotte, North Carolina. Given the length of the redevelopment and lease-up process, these properties are not placed in service until, in some cases, years after we commence the project.\n\n \u25cf A decrease in interest expense of approximately $1.6 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower debt outstanding, which was partially offset by higher interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. \nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated financial statements, including trends which might appear, should not be taken as necessarily indicative of future operations. The following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K may also contain forward-looking statements based on current judgments and current knowledge of management, which are subject to certain risks, trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that our forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty, including without limitation, economic conditions in the United States, changes in interest rates as a result of economic conditions or a downgrade in our credit rating, disruptions in the debt markets, economic conditions in the markets in which we own properties, risks of a lessening of demand for the types of real estate owned by us, uncertainties relating to fiscal policy, changes in government regulations and regulatory uncertainty, changes in energy prices, geopolitical events, and expenditures that cannot be anticipated such as utility rate and usage increases, unanticipated repairs, additional staffing, insurance increases and real estate tax valuation reassessments. See Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We may not update any of the forward-looking statements after the date this Annual Report on Form 10-K is filed to conform them to actual results or to changes in our expectations that occur after such date, other than as required by law.\nPreviously we operated in the investment banking segment, and in December 2011, we discontinued those activities. The investment banking segment involved the structuring of real estate investments and broker/dealer services that included the organization of Sponsored REITs, the acquisition and development of real estate on behalf of Sponsored REITs and the raising of capital to equitize the Sponsored REITs through sale of preferred stock in private placements. On December 15, 2011, we announced that our broker/dealer subsidiary, FSP Investments LLC, would no longer sponsor the syndication of shares of preferred stock in newly-formed Sponsored REITs. On July 15, 2014, FSP Investments LLC withdrew its registration as a broker/dealer with FINRA.\nCash and cash equivalents were $9.8 million and $11.2 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The decrease of $1.4 million is attributable to $81.9 million provided by operating activities, less $19.6 million used by investing activities and $63.7 million used in financing activities. Management believes that existing cash, cash anticipated to be generated internally by operations and our existing debt financing will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Although there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the funds necessary for our future growth, we anticipate generating funds from continuing real estate operations. We believe that we have adequate funds to cover unusual expenses and capital improvements, in addition to normal operating expenses. Our ability to maintain or increase our level of dividends to stockholders, however, depends in significant part upon the level of rental income from our real properties and our interest costs.\nWe intend to draw on the BAML Credit Facility in the future for a variety of corporate purposes, including the acquisition of properties that we acquire directly for our portfolio and for Sponsored REIT Loans as described below.\nThe BAML Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers and acquisitions, disposition of assets, changes in business, certain restricted payments, the requirement to have subsidiaries provide a guaranty in the event that they incur recourse indebtedness and transactions with affiliates. The BAML Credit Facility also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio, and minimum unsecured interest coverage. The BAML Credit Facility provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, certain cross defaults and a change in control of the Company (as defined in the BAML Credit Facility). In the event of a default by the Company, the administrative agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of lenders shall, declare all obligations under the BAML Credit Facility immediately due and payable, terminate the lenders' commitments to make loans under the BAML Credit Facility, and enforce any and all rights of the lenders or administrative agent under the BAML Credit Facility and related documents. For certain events of default related to bankruptcy, insolvency, and receivership, the commitments of lenders will be automatically terminated and all outstanding obligations of the Company will become immediately due and payable. We were in compliance with the BAML Credit Facility financial covenants as of December 31, 2019.\n \u25cf A decrease in rental revenue of approximately $3.5 million arising primarily from the loss of rental income from leases that expired in 2018 and 2017 and from the loss of revenue from properties that we sold on January 6, 2017 and October 20, 2017. The decrease was partially offset by rental income earned from leases commencing in 2018 and 2017. Our leased space in our operating properties decreased 0.7% to 89.0% at December 31, 2018 compared to 89.7% at December 31, 2017, lease expirations exceeding new leases signed and partially as a result of classification of two properties as redevelopment properties. \n\n (3) Amounts include prinicipal and interest payments. \n (4) Interest payments were estimated based on an interest rate swap with an effective interest rate of 3.69% per annum on $100 million as of December 31, 2019, and the variable rate in effect as of December 31, 2019, which was at an annual rate of 3.06% on $50 million as of December 31, 2019. \nThe JPM Term Loan bears interest at either (i) a number of basis points over a LIBOR-based rate depending on the Company's credit rating (125.0 basis points over a LIBOR-based rate at December 31, 2019) or (ii) a number of basis points over the base rate depending on the Company's credit rating (25.0 basis points over the base rate at December 31, 2019).\nDuring 2018:\nOur commercial real estate operations include the leasing of office buildings subject to leases with terms greater than one year. The leases thereon expire at various dates through 2036. Approximate undiscounted cash flows of rental income from non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2019 is:\nBAML Term Loan Highlights\nThe increase was partially offset by:\n\nThe following table shows financial results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nInvesting Activities\nThe calculations of FFO are shown in the following table:\nLease Classification\nTaxes on income\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2016, we reached an agreement to sell an office property located in Milpitas, California. The property was classified as an asset held for sale at December 31, 2016 and was sold on January 6, 2017 at a $2.3 million gain.\nWe allocate the value of real estate acquired among land, buildings, improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities, which may consist of the value of above market and below market leases, the value of in-place leases, and the value of tenant relationships. Purchase price allocations and the determination of the useful lives are based on management's estimates. Under some circumstances we may rely upon studies commissioned from independent real estate appraisal firms in determining the purchase price allocations.\nLeasing\n \u25cf A decrease in interest income from Sponsored REIT loans of approximately $1.5 million primarily as a result of repayment of an outstanding loan by a Sponsored REIT of approximately $51 million in June 2019. \nBAML Credit Facility\nOther\nOn July 21, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment (the BAML First Amendment\u201d), and on October 18, 2017, the Company entered into a Second Amendment (the BAML Second Amendment\u201d), to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated October 29, 2014 among the Company, the lending institutions party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender (as amended by the BAML First Amendment and the BAML Second Amendment, the BAML Credit Facility\u201d) that continued an existing unsecured revolving line of credit (the BAML Revolver\u201d) and an existing term loan (the BAML Term Loan\u201d).\nWe will continue to evaluate our portfolio, and in the future may decide to dispose of additional properties from time-to-time in the ordinary course of business. As an important part of our total return strategy, we intend to be active in property dispositions when we believe that we have maximized value and that market conditions warrant such activity and, as a consequence, we continuously review and evaluate our portfolio of properties for potentially advantageous dispositions.\n \u25cf useful lives of fixed assets and intangibles; \nThe redevelopment of Blue Lagoon commenced in December 2018 following the maturity of a lease with a major tenant that occupied 100% of the property. On September 13, 2019, we entered into a lease agreement with a new tenant with an initial term of 16 years for approximately 156,000 square feet, or 73.1% of the property's rentable square feet. We expect to incur total restoration, redevelopment and lease-up costs of $38.9 million, which include work on the roof of the building, costs to make the space suitable for multiple tenants and to increase parking at the property. As of December 31, 2019, we had incurred approximately $8.7 million in total redevelopment costs. We anticipate completing the redevelopment by the end of 2020.\n (1) No principal was outstanding on the BAML Revolver as of December 31, 2019. \nOur property located at 801 Marquette Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota ( 801 Marquette Avenue\u201d) had approximately 170,000 square feet of rentable space and became vacant in January 2016. On June 30, 2016, we commenced a redevelopment plan for the property and substantially completed the redevelopment in the second quarter of 2017. Redevelopment of 801 Marquette Avenue resulted in approximately 129,800 of net rentable square feet for the property. As of December 31, 2019, we have signed leases with two tenants that now occupy 48,000 square feet, or 37% of rentable square feet at the property. As a result, we had rental income of $278,000 and operating expenses of $319,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2019. We had rental income of $750,000 and operating expenses of $1,158,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. We had rental income of $71,000 and had operating expenses of $302,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nWhile we cannot generally predict when an existing vacancy in our owned portfolio will be leased or if existing tenants with expiring leases will renew their leases or what the terms and conditions of the lease renewals will be, we expect to renew or sign new leases at then-current market rates for locations in which the buildings are located, which could be above or below the expiring rates. Also, we believe the potential for any of our tenants to default on its lease or to seek the protection of bankruptcy exists. If any of our tenants defaults on its lease, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment. In addition, at any time, a tenant of one of our properties may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws, which could result in the rejection and termination of such tenant's lease and thereby cause a reduction in cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nThe equity investments in Sponsored REITS were reviewed for impairment each reporting period. The Company recorded impairment charges when events or circumstances indicate a decline in the fair value below the carrying value of the investment has occurred and such decline is other than temporary.\nThe economy in the United States is continuing to experience a period of economic growth, which directly affects the demand for office space, our primary income producing asset. The broad economic market conditions in the United States are affected by numerous factors, including but not limited to, inflation and employment levels, energy prices, the pace of economic growth and/or recessionary concerns, uncertainty about government fiscal, monetary, trade and tax policies, changes in currency exchange rates, geopolitical events, the regulatory environment, the availability of credit and interest rates. Any increase in interest rates could result in increased borrowing costs to us. However, we could also benefit from any further improved economic fundamentals and increasing levels of employment. We believe\nFunds From Operations\n \u25cf valuation of derivatives; \nBMO Term Loan\n \u25cf A decrease in general and administrative expenses of $0.4 million as a result of decreases in personnel expenses. We had 38 employees as of February 7, 2019 and December 31, 2018, and 39 employees as of December 31, 2017. \nProperty Dispositions and Assets Held for Sale\n \u25cf A decrease in depreciation and amortization of approximately $7.0 million, which were primarily attributable to the disposition of two properties during 2017. \nThe BMO Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers and acquisitions, disposition of assets, changes in business, certain restricted payments, the requirement to have subsidiaries provide a guaranty in the event that they incur recourse indebtedness and transactions with affiliates. The BMO Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio, and minimum unsecured interest coverage. The BMO Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, certain cross defaults and a change in control of the Company (as defined in the BMO Credit Agreement). In the event of a default by the Company, the administrative agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of lenders shall, declare all obligations under the BMO Credit Agreement immediately due and payable, terminate the lenders' commitments to make loans under the BMO Credit Agreement, and enforce any and all rights of the lenders or administrative agent under the BMO Credit Agreement and related documents. For certain events of default related to bankruptcy, insolvency, and receivership, the commitments of lenders will be automatically terminated and all outstanding obligations of the Company will become immediately due and payable. We were in compliance with the BMO Term Loan financial covenants as of December 31, 2019.\n \u25cf during the year ended December 31, we received approximately $1.1 million in cash from Satellite Place, as partial prepayment of a Sponsored REIT Loan; and \n \u25cf allowance for doubtful accounts; \n \u25cf we received approximately $1.1 million in cash from Satellite Place, as partial prepayment of a Sponsored REIT Loan; \nEquity in income from non-consolidated REITs was $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. All of our investments in non-consolidated REITs were liquidated during 2018. The equity in income during the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of equity in income from our preferred stock investment in East Wacker of $7.2 million, which sold its property on September 24, 2018, and was partially offset by equity in loss from our preferred stock investment in Grand Boulevard of $0.1 million, which sold its property on July 19, 2018. In addition, for the three months ended June 30, 2018, we recognized an impairment charge of $0.3 million, which represented the other-than-temporary decline in the fair value below the carrying value of the Company's investments in non-consolidated REITs.\n \u25cf ownership of stock in a Sponsored REIT and related interests. \nOn October 24, 2017, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) with the various purchasers named therein (the Purchasers\u201d) in connection with a private placement of senior unsecured notes. Under the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to sell to the Purchasers an aggregate principal amount of $200,000,000 of senior unsecured notes consisting of (i) 3.99% Series A Senior Notes due December 20, 2024 in an aggregate principal amount of $116 million (the Series A Notes\u201d) and (ii) 4.26% Series B Senior Notes due December 20, 2027 in an aggregate principal amount of $84 million (the Series B Notes,\u201d and, together with the Series A Notes, the Senior Notes\u201d). On December 20, 2017, the Senior Notes were funded and proceeds were used to reduce the outstanding balance of the BAML Revolver.\nAs of December 31, 2019, leases for approximately 7.7% and 8.1% of the square footage in our owned portfolio are scheduled to expire during 2020 and 2021, respectively. As the first quarter of 2020 begins, we believe that our operating properties are well stabilized, with a balanced lease expiration schedule, and that existing vacancy is being actively marketed to numerous potential tenants. We believe that most of our largest property markets are now experiencing generally steady or improving rental conditions. We are seeing increased potential leasing activity in the energy influenced market of Denver compared to the last several years. We anticipate positive leasing activity within our operating properties throughout 2020.\nAlthough the interest rate on the BMO Term Loan is variable under the BMO Credit Agreement, the Company fixed the base LIBOR interest rate by entering into interest rate swap transactions. On August 26, 2013, the Company entered into an ISDA Master Agreement with Bank of Montreal that fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BMO Term Loan at 2.32% per annum until August 26, 2020. On February 20, 2019, the Company entered into ISDA Master Agreements with a group of banks that fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BMO Term Loan at 2.39% per annum for the period beginning on August 26, 2020 and ending January 31, 2024. Accordingly, based upon the Company's credit rating, as of December 31, 2019, the effective interest rate on the BMO Term Loan was 3.57% per annum.\nOverview\nFor purposes of the BAML Credit Facility, base rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of: (i) the bank's prime rate for such day, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate for such day, plus 0.50%, and (iii) the one month LIBOR based rate for such day plus 1.00%. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's credit rating from Moody's Investors Service was Baa3.\nEconomic Conditions\n \u25cf on July 19, 2018, an office property owned by a Sponsored REIT, FSP Grand Boulevard Corp. (Grand Boulevard) was sold to a third party. We held an equity investment in Grand Boulevard and received a liquidating distribution of its investment of $6.2 million on July 20, 2018. The Company received an initial cash distribution of $5.9 million from the liquidating trust of Grand Boulevard on August 17, 2018; and \nrefinance or retire indebtedness and for working capital and other general business purposes, in each case to the extent permitted under the BAML Credit Facility.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nmillion tranche A term loan and a $165 million tranche B term loan. The tranche A term loan matures on November 30, 2021 and the tranche B term loan matures on January 31, 2024. The BMO Credit Agreement also includes an accordion feature that allows up to $100 million of additional loans, subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of certain customary conditions.\nExpenses\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nContingencies\nrecorded as a provision for loss on a property held for sale of $20.5 million and was classified as an asset held for sale of $31.9 million at June 30, 2017. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we increased the provision for loss by $0.3 million to $20.7 million and the property was classified as an asset held for sale in the amount of $31.6 million at September 30, 2017. We sold the property on October 20, 2017 for net proceeds of $31.6 million resulting in a total loss of $20.8 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 7.8 million square feet, or approximately 78% of our total owned portfolio, was located in Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Houston and Minneapolis. From time-to-time we may dispose of our smaller, suburban office assets and replace them with larger urban infill and central business district office assets. As we execute this strategy, short term operating results could be adversely impacted. However, we believe that the transformed portfolio has the potential to provide higher profit and asset value growth over a longer period of time.\nResults of Operations\n \u25cf classification of leases; and \nCash provided by our operating activities of $81.9 million is primarily attributable to net income of $6.5 million plus the add-back of $84.8 million of non-cash expenses, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $4.3 million, an increase in tenant security deposits of $3.0 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.3 million and a decrease in tenant rent receivables of $0.1 million. These increases were partially offset by a $15.1 million increase in payments of deferred leasing commissions and a $4.0 million increase in lease acquisition costs.\n \u25cf On September 27, 2012, the Company drew down the entire $400 million under the BAML Term Loan and such amount remains fully advanced and outstanding under the BAML Term Loan. \nOwnership of Stock in a Sponsored REIT and Related Interests\nIncluded in income taxes is the Revised Texas Franchise Tax, which is a tax on revenues from Texas properties, which increased $75,000, and federal and other income taxes, which decreased by $166,000, during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of a refund arising due to the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nWe periodically evaluate our real estate properties for impairment indicators. These indicators may include declining tenant occupancy, weak or declining tenant profitability, cash flow or liquidity, our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or legislative, economic or market changes that permanently reduce the value of our investments. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the property by comparing it to its expected future undiscounted cash flows. If the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value, we reduce the net carrying value of the property to the present value of these expected future cash flows. This analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows. If we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future tenant profitability, market or industry factors differ from our expectations, we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate or fail to record a charge when we should have done so, or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate.\nFor purposes of the BAML Credit Facility, base rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of: (i) the bank's prime rate for such day, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate for such day, plus 0.50%, and (iii) the one month LIBOR based rate for such day plus 1.00%. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's credit rating from Moody's Investors Service was Baa3.\n\nBAML Revolver Highlights\nTotal revenues decreased by approximately $3.7 million to $268.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily a result of:\n \u25cf The BAML Term Loan matures on January 12, 2023. \nThe property located in Houston, Texas has approximately 157,000 square feet of rentable space and became substantially vacant on April 30, 2017 when two tenants vacated 155,000 square feet of space. The property signed leases that commenced in 2019 for approximately 105,000 square feet, or 66.9% of the square feet of the property. We had rental income of $156,000 and had operating expenses of $1,484,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nEquity in income from non-consolidated REITs is $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to equity in loss of $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The equity in income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of equity in income from our preferred stock investment in East Wacker of $7.2 million, which sold its property on September 24, 2018, and was partially offset by equity in loss from our preferred stock investment in Grand Boulevard of $0.1 million, which sold its property on July 19, 2018. In addition, during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, we recognized an impairment charge of $0.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, which represented the other-than-temporary decline in the fair value below the carrying value of the Company's investments in non-consolidated REITs.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $13.1 million compared to a net loss of $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, for the reasons described above.\n \u25cf Borrowings made pursuant to the BAML Revolver may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time until the maturity date of January12, 2022. The Company has the right to extend the maturity date of the BAML Revolver by two additional 6 month periods, or until January 12, 2023, upon payment of a fee and satisfaction of certain customary conditions. \nDuring 2019:\nSenior Notes\n \u25cf An increase in general and administrative expenses of $1.4 million, which was primarily attributable to personnel related expenses and lease acquisition costs. \nWe provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on collectability. Lessors recognize the effect of a change in their assessment of whether the collectability of operating lease receivables are probable as an adjustment to lease income rather than bad debt expense.\nTotal expenses decreased by $1.9 million to $262.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily a result of:\nAlthough the interest rate on the JPM Term Loan is variable under the JPM Credit Agreement, the Company fixed the LIBOR-based rate on a portion of the JPM Term Loan by entering into interest rate swap transactions. On March 7, 2019, the Company entered into ISDA Master Agreements with various financial institutions to hedge a $100 million portion of the future LIBOR-based rate risk under the JPM Credit Agreement. Effective March 29, 2019, the Company fixed the LIBOR-based rate at 2.44% per annum on a $100 million portion of the JPM Term Loan until November 30, 2021. Accordingly, based upon the Company's credit rating, as of December 31, 2019, the effective interest rate on a $100 million portion of the JPM Term Loan was 3.69% per annum.\nContractual Obligations\n (2) Amounts reflect a facility fee calculated as 0.0025% of the $600 million available to be drawn. \nThe main factor that affects our real estate operations is the broad economic market conditions in the United States. These market conditions affect the occupancy levels and the rent levels on both a national and local level. We have no influence on broader economic/market conditions. We look to acquire and/or develop quality properties in good locations in order to lessen the impact of downturns in the market and to take advantage of upturns when they occur.\n (5) The BAML Term Loan has an interest rate swap with an effective interest rate of 2.47% per annum as of December 31, 2019, which was used for estimating interest. The swap expires on September 27, 2021. Interest payments between September 27, 2021 and maturity were estimated based on the variable rate in effect as of December 31, 2019, which was at an annual rate of 3.11%. \nThese policies involve significant judgments made based upon our experience, including judgments about current valuations, ultimate realizable value, estimated useful lives, salvage or residual value, the ability of our tenants to perform their obligations to us, current and future economic conditions and competitive factors in the markets in which our properties are located. Competition, economic conditions and other factors may cause occupancy declines in the future. In the future we may need to revise our carrying value assessments to incorporate information which is not now known and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own, result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets.\nTax expense on income\nThe operating lease in the table above consists of our lease of corporate office space, which commenced September 1, 2010, and was amended on October 25, 2016. The amended lease expires on September 30, 2024 and has one five year renewal option. The lease includes a base annual rent and additional rent for our share of taxes and operating costs.\nLoans to Sponsored REITs\n \u25cf A decrease in depreciation and amortization of approximately $3.3 million. \nTotal expenses increased by $0.1 million to $262.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily a result of:\nImpairment\n \u25cf during the year ended December 31, 2019, we received approximately $1.1 million as full repayment of a Sponsored REIT Loan with FSP Satellite Place Corp. ( Satellite Place\u201d) and we received approximately $51 million as full repayment of a Sponsored REIT Loan with FSP Energy Tower I Corp.; \nAt December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we held a common stock interest in 2, 3 and 6 Sponsored REITs, respectively, all of which were fully syndicated and in which we no longer share economic benefit or risk.\nBased upon the Company's credit rating, as of December 31, 2019, the effective interest rate on the unhedged $50 million portion of the JPM Term Loan was 3.06% per annum. The weighted average interest rate on the unhedged $50 million portion of the JPM Term Loan during the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 3.54% per annum. The weighted average interest rate on the JPM Term Loan during the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 3.33% per annum.\n \u25cf The BAML Credit Facility includes an accordion feature that allows for an aggregate amount of up to $500 million of additional borrowing capacity to the BAML Revolver and/or the BAML Term Loan, subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of certain customary conditions. \nin depreciation and amortization expenses which do not appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods, as is required by generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe Note Purchase Agreement contains customary financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio. The Note Purchase Agreement also contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to enter into transactions with affiliates, merge, consolidate, create liens, make certain restricted payments, enter into certain agreements or prepay certain indebtedness. Such financial and restrictive covenants are substantially similar to the corresponding covenants contained in the BAML Credit Facility, the BMO Credit Agreement and the JPM Credit Agreement. The Senior Notes financial covenants require, among other things, the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50; a maximum leverage ratio and an unsecured leverage ratio of no more than 60% (65% if there were a significant acquisition for a short period of time). In addition, the Note Purchase Agreement provides that the Note Purchase Agreement will automatically incorporate additional financial and other specified covenants (such as limitations on investments and distributions) that are effective from time to time under the existing credit agreements, other material indebtedness or certain other private placements of debt of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, cross defaults with certain other indebtedness, breaches of covenants and bankruptcy events. In the case of an event of default, the Purchasers may, among other remedies, accelerate the payment of all obligations. We were in compliance with the Senior Notes financial covenants as of December 31, 2019.\nFrom time to time, we may provide financing to Sponsored REITs in the form of a construction loan and/or a revolving line of credit secured by a mortgage. As of December 31, 2019, we had one loan outstanding for $21 million principal amount with one Sponsored REIT under such arrangements for the purpose of funding construction costs, capital expenditures, leasing costs or for other purposes. We anticipate that advances made under these facilities will be repaid at their maturity date or earlier from refinancing, long term financings of the underlying properties, cash flows from the underlying properties or another other capital event.\n * Excludes NOI from investments in and interest income from secured loans to non-consolidated REITs. \n\n (6) The BMO Term Loan has an interest rate swap with an effective interest rate of 3.57% per annum as of December 31, 2019, which was used for estimating interest. The swap expires on August 26, 2020. Interest payments between August 26, 2020 and maturity have an interest swap with an effective interest rate of 3.64% per annum as of December 31, 2019, which was used for estimating interest. \nFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs.\nThe Sponsored REITs own real estate, purchases of which were financed through the private placement of equity in those entities, typically through syndication. These Sponsored REITs are operated in a manner intended to qualify as real estate investment trusts. We earned fees related to the sale of preferred stock in the Sponsored REITs in these syndications. The Sponsored REITs issued both common stock and preferred stock. The common stock is owned by FSP Corp. Generally the preferred stock is owned by unaffiliated investors, however, we held an interest in preferred shares of two Sponsored REITs, which were liquidated during 2018. In addition, directors and officers of FSP Corp., have from time to time invested in Sponsored REITs. Following consummation of the offerings, the preferred stockholders in each of the Sponsored REITs were entitled to 100% of the Sponsored REIT's cash distributions. Subsequent to the completion of the offering of preferred shares, except for the preferred stock we previously owned, we do not share in any of the Sponsored REIT's earnings, or any related dividend, and the common stock ownership interests have virtually no economic benefit or risk.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $6.5 million compared to net income of $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the reasons described above.\nOther Considerations\nFinancing Activities\nAdditional information about our Sponsored REIT Loans outstanding as of December 31, 2019, including a summary table of our Sponsored REIT Loans, is incorporated herein by reference to Note 3, Related Party Transactions and Investments in Non-Consolidated Entities - Management fees and interest income from loans\u201d, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\n \u25cf A decrease in interest income from loans to Sponsored REITs of approximately $0.1 million as a result of repayments of Sponsored REIT Loans, which was partially offset by higher interest rates in 2018 compared to 2017. \nThe Company may use the proceeds of the loans under the BAML Credit Facility to finance the acquisition of real properties and for other permitted investments; to finance investments associated with Sponsored REITs, to\n \u25cf assessment of the carrying values and impairments of long lived assets; \nGains (loss) on sale of properties\n\nWe have certain critical accounting policies that are subject to judgments and estimates by our management and uncertainties of outcome that affect the application of these policies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. The accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations, and that require significant management estimates and judgments, are discussed below. Significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts, purchase price allocations, useful lives of fixed assets, impairment considerations and the valuation of derivatives.\n \u25cf on June 7, we received approximately $9.0 million in cash from FSP 1441 Main Street Corp. as repayment in full of a Sponsored REIT Loan; \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\nother REITs that define NOI differently. NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of the Company's liquidity or its ability to make distributions. The calculations of NOI are shown in the following table:\nSome of our real estate properties are leased on a triple net basis, pursuant to non-cancelable, fixed term, operating leases. Each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate whether it is appropriately classified as a capital lease or as an operating lease. The classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property, as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue. These evaluations require us to make estimates of, among other things, the remaining useful life and market value of a property, discount rates and future cash flows. Incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases.\n \u25cf on October 20, we received approximately $31.6 million in proceeds from the sale of a property located in Baltimore, Maryland. \nThe Company evaluates performance based on Funds From Operations, which we refer to as FFO, as management believes that FFO represents the most accurate measure of activity and is the basis for distributions paid to equity holders. The Company defines FFO as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, hedge ineffectiveness, acquisition costs of newly acquired properties that are not capitalized and lease acquisition costs that are not capitalized plus depreciation and amortization, including amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and impairment charges on properties or investments in non-consolidated REITs, and after adjustments to exclude equity in income or losses from, and, to include the proportionate share of FFO from, non-consolidated REITs.\nSponsored REIT Loans\n \u25cf on February 2, 2019, we received a cash distribution of approximately $0.2 million from the liquidating trust of Grand Boulevard (defined below) and anticipate receiving additional liquidating distributions of approximately $0.1 million in the aggregate as the trust is liquidated; \nNet income\n \u25cf allocation of purchase price; \nAs of December 31, 2019, our real estate portfolio was comprised of 32 operating properties, which we refer to as our operating properties, and 3 redevelopment properties, which we refer to as our redevelopment properties, that are in the process of being redeveloped, or are completed but not yet stabilized. We collectively refer to our operating and our redevelopment properties as our owned portfolio. Our 32 operating properties were approximately 87.6% leased as of December 31, 2019, a decrease from 89.0% as of December 31, 2018. The 1.4% decrease in leased space was a result of the impact of lease expirations and terminations, which exceeded leasing completed during the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,175,000 square feet of vacancy in our operating properties compared to approximately 1,046,000 square feet of vacancy at December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we leased approximately 1,417,000 square feet of office space, of which approximately 883,000 square feet were with existing tenants, at a weighted average term of 8.3 years. On average, tenant improvements for such leases were $34.44 per square foot, lease commissions were $13.51 per square foot and rent concessions were approximately three months of free rent. Average GAAP base rents under such leases were $31.78 per square foot, or 10.9% higher than average rents in the respective properties as applicable compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe following table shows financial results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nEquity in income (loss) of non-consolidated REITs\n \u25cf A decrease in management fee income of approximately $0.1 million primarily as a result of the liquidation of three Sponsored REITs during 2018 and one Sponsored REIT during 2017. \nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018\nThe redevelopment at 801 Marquette was substantially completed at the end of the second quarter of 2017 and is in the process of being leased up; however, it is not stabilized. As of December 31, 2019, we had leases signed and tenants occupying approximately 37.0% of the rentable square feet of the property. We expect to incur redevelopment and lease-up costs of $28.8 million, of which we had incurred approximately $23.0 million as of December 31, 2019.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017\nThe Company provides property performance based on NOI. Management believes that investors are interested in this information. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as net income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) plus general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, including amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and impairment charges, interest expense, less equity in earnings of nonconsolidated REITs, interest income, management fee income, hedge ineffectiveness, gains or losses on the sale of assets and excludes non-property specific income and expenses. The information presented includes footnotes and the data is shown by region with properties owned in both periods, which we call Same Store. The Comparative Same Store results include properties held for the periods presented and exclude properties that are non-operating, being developed or redeveloped, dispositions and significant nonrecurring income such as bankruptcy settlements and lease termination fees. NOI, as defined by the Company, may not be comparable to NOI reported by\n \u25cf we have continued to actively explore additional potential real estate investment opportunities and anticipate further real estate investments in the future. \n \u25cf on September 24, 2018, an office property owned by a Sponsored REIT, FSP 303 East Wacker Drive Corp (East Wacker) was sold to a third party. We held an equity investment in East Wacker and received a liquidating distribution of its investment of $70.0 million on September 25, 2018. We received an initial cash distribution of $69.0 million from the liquidating trust of East Wacker on September 27, 2018. \nInvestments in Sponsored REITs\n\n \u25cf The BAML Revolver is for borrowings, at the Company's election, of up to $600 million. Borrowings made pursuant to the BAML Revolver may be revolving loans, swing line loans or letters of credit, the combined sum of which may not exceed $600 million outstanding at any time. \nThe redevelopment of Forest Park commenced in January 2019 following the maturity of a lease with a tenant that occupied 100% of the property through December 31, 2018. We expect to incur total redevelopment and lease-up costs of $4.4 million, which include interior work to make the space suitable for multiple tenants. As of December 31, 2019, we had incurred approximately $0.7 million in redevelopment costs. We anticipate completing the redevelopment by June 30, 2020.\n \u25cf on April 3, 2019 we received a cash distribution of approximately $1.0 million from the liquidating trust of East Wacker (defined below); and \nBased upon the Company's credit rating, as of December 31, 2019, the interest rate on the BAML Revolver was 2.96% per annum. The weighted average interest rate on all amounts outstanding on the BAML Revolver during the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 3.67% per annum. As of December 31, 2018, there were borrowings of $25 million outstanding under the BAML Revolver at an interest rate of 3.63% per annum. The weighted average interest rate on all amounts outstanding on the BAML Revolver during the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 3.09% per annum.\nAlthough the interest rate on the BAML Credit Facility is variable, the Company fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BAML Term Loan by entering into interest rate swap transactions. On July 22, 2016, the Company entered into ISDA Master Agreements with a group of banks that fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BAML Term Loan at 1.12% per annum for the period beginning on September 27, 2017 and ending on September 27, 2021. Accordingly, based upon the Company's credit rating, as of December 31, 2019, the effective interest rate on the BAML Term Loan was 2.47% per annum.\nAs a common stockholder, we have no rights to the Sponsored REIT's earnings or any related cash distributions. However, upon liquidation of a Sponsored REIT, we are entitled to our percentage interest as a common stockholder in any proceeds remaining after the preferred stockholders have recovered their investment. Our common stock percentage interest in each Sponsored REIT is less than 1%. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Sponsored REIT's preferred stockholders is required for any actions involving merger, sale of property, amendment to charter or issuance of additional capital stock. In addition, all of the Sponsored REITs allow the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding preferred shares to remove (without cause) and replace one or more members of that Sponsored REIT's board of directors.\nFrom time to time, we may provide Sponsored REIT Loans to our Sponsored REITs. As of December 31, 2019, we had one Sponsored REIT Loan with $21 million principal amount outstanding. Additional information about our Sponsored REIT Loan outstanding as of December 31, 2019, including a summary table of our Sponsored REIT Loan, is incorporated herein by reference to Note 3, Related

Rental revenue increased due to higher termination fees, offset by loss of rental income from expired leases.\n\n- Net income in 2019 was $6.5 million compared to $13.1 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower equity in income from non-consolidated REITs. \n\n- The company has credit facilities with Bank of America, JPMorgan and Bank of Montreal. It uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk on some of the variable rate debt. \n\n- The company provides loans to sponsored REITs it manages. As of Dec 31, 2019 it had 1 sponsored REIT loan outstanding with $21 million principal.\n\n- The company believes existing cash, cash from operations and existing debt financing will be sufficient to meet needs for at least the next 12 months.\n\nIn summary, the company continues to actively manage its portfolio of office properties and credit facilities amidst changing economic conditions. Performance in 2019 declined compared to 2018 but operating metrics remain relatively stable."}
