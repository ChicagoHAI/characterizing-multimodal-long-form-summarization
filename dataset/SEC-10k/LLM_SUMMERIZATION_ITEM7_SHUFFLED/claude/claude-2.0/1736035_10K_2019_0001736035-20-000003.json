Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe discussion and analysis contained in this section refers to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K Risk Factors.\u201d Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed under Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The year ended December 31, 2018 represents the period from November 20, 2018 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2018.\nOverview and Investment Framework\nWe are a Delaware statutory trust structured as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. We are managed by our Adviser. The Administrator will provide the administrative services necessary for us to operate.\nOur investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation.\nUnder normal market conditions, we generally invest at least 80% of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in secured debt investments (including investments that are secured by equity interests) and our portfolio is composed primarily of first lien senior secured and unitranche loans (including first out/last out loans), generally with total investment sizes less than $300 million, which criteria may change from time to time. To a lesser extent, we have and may continue to also invest in second lien, third lien, unsecured or subordinated loans, generally with total investment sizes less than $100 million, which criteria may change from time to time, and other debt and equity securities. We do not currently focus on investments in issuers that are distressed or in need of rescue financing.\nWe commenced our loan origination and investment activities contemporaneously with the Initial Drawdown on November 20, 2018. The proceeds from the Initial Drawdown and availability under our credit facilities provided us with the necessary seed capital to commence operations. See -Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources-Borrowings.\u201d We anticipate raising additional equity capital for investment purposes through additional closings under the Private Offering.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nInvestments\nWe focus primarily on loans and securities, including syndicated loans, of private U.S. companies, specifically small and middle market companies, which we define as companies with annual revenue of $50 million to $2.5 billion, at the time of investment. Specifically, for our originated investments, we target companies with $25 million to $75 million of EBITDA. In many market environments, we believe such a focus offers an opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns.\nOur level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, trading prices of loans and other securities and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues in the form of interest income from the debt securities we hold and dividends and capital appreciation on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. Our debt investments typically have a term of five to eight years and bear interest at floating rates on the basis of a benchmark such as LIBOR. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we may receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date.\nIn addition, we generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, and possibly consulting fees.\nExpenses\nExcept as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (a) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; (b) our allocable portion of compensation, overhead (including rent, office equipment and utilities) and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement, including but not limited to: (i) our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs; (ii) investor relations, legal, operations and other non-investment professionals at the Administrator that perform duties for us; and (iii) any internal audit group personnel of Blackstone or any of its affiliates; and (c) all other expenses of our operations and transactions.\nWith respect to costs incurred in connection with the Company's organization and offering costs, if actual organization and offering costs incurred exceed 0.10% of our total Capital Commitments, the Adviser or its affiliates will bear the excess costs. To the extent our Capital Commitments later increase, the Adviser or its affiliates may be reimbursed for past payments of excess organization and offering costs made on our behalf provided that the total organization and offering costs borne by us do not exceed 0.10% of total Capital Commitments and provided further that the Adviser or its affiliates may not be reimbursed for payment of excess organization and offering expenses that were incurred more than three years prior to the proposed reimbursement. Any sales load, platform fees, servicing fees or similar fees or expenses charged directly to an investor in our Private Offering by a placement agent or similar party will not be considered organization or offering expenses of the Company for purposes of our cap on organization and offering expenses.\nFrom time to time, the Adviser, the Administrator or their affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse the Adviser, Administrator or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. From time to time, the Adviser or the Administrator may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. In this regard, the Administrator has waived the right to be reimbursed for rent and related occupancy costs. However, the Administrator may seek reimbursement for such costs in future periods. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our shareholders, subject to the cap on organization and offering expenses described above.\nCosts and expenses of the Administrator and the Adviser that are eligible for reimbursement by us will be reasonably allocated to the Company on the basis of time spent, assets under management, usage rates, proportionate holdings, a combination thereof or other reasonable methods determined by the Administrator in accordance with policies adopted by the Board.\nOn December 12, 2018, we entered into an Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. The Expense Support Agreement provides that, at such times as the Adviser determines, the Adviser may pay certain Expense Payments of the Company, provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any of our interest expense. Such Expense Payment must be made in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than forty-five days after a written commitment from the Adviser to pay such expense, and/or by an offset against amounts due from us to the Adviser or its affiliates. Following any calendar quarter in which Available Operating Funds (as defined in the Expense Support Agreement) exceed Excess Operating Funds, we shall pay Reimbursement Payments to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter have been reimbursed. The amount of the Reimbursement Payment for any calendar quarter shall equal the lesser of (i) the Excess Operating Funds in such quarter and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter that have not been previously reimbursed by us to the Adviser. The Expense Support Agreement provides additional restrictions on the amount of each Reimbursement Payment for any calendar quarter. The Adviser may waive its right to receive all or a portion of any Reimbursement Payment in any particular calendar quarter, so that such Reimbursement Payment may be reimbursable in a future calendar quarter.\nHedging\nWe may, but are not required to, enter into interest rate, foreign exchange or other derivative agreements to hedge interest rate, currency, credit or other risks, but we do not generally intend to enter into any such derivative agreements for speculative purposes. Any derivative agreements entered into for speculative purposes are not expected to be material to our business or results of operations. These hedging activities, which will be in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory\nrequirements, may include the use of futures, options and forward contracts. We will bear the costs incurred in connection with entering into, administering and settling any such derivative contracts. There can be no assurance any hedging strategy we employ will be successful.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we acquired $3,298.8 million aggregate principal amount of investments (including $173.0 million of remaining unfunded commitments), $3,243.2 million of which was first lien debt, $42.1 million of which was second lien debt and $13.5 million of which was equity. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired $616.9 million aggregate principal amount of investments (including $54.7 million of unfunded commitments), $610.5 million of which was first lien debt and $6.4 million of which was second lien debt.\nOur investment activity is presented below (information presented herein is at amortized cost unless otherwise indicated) (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments, beginning of period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>548,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New investments purchased </td> <td>3,078,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>549,058 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net accretion of discount on investments </td> <td>9,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gain (loss) on investments </td> <td>3,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments sold or repaid </td> <td>(572,830) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(432) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments, end of period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,067,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>548,753 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount of investments funded at principal: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First lien debt investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,104,807 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>555,449 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien debt investments </td> <td>42,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity investments </td> <td>13,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,160,377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>561,830 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from investments sold or repaid: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First lien debt investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(558,149) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(432) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien debt investments </td> <td>(14,681) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(572,830) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(432) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of portfolio companies </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average yield on debt and income producing investments, at\namortized cost(1)(2)\n</td> <td>8.64 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.70 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average yield on debt and income producing investments, at\nfair value(1)(2)\n</td> <td>8.57 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.76 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of debt investments bearing a floating rate </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of debt investments bearing a fixed rate </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield plus the annual accretion of discounts or less the annual amortization of premiums, as applicable, on accruing debt included in such securities, divided by (b) total first lien and second lien debt (at fair value or cost, as applicable) included in such securities.

of $1.6 million and $2.1 million, respectively, which are included within interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations) increased from the prior year primarily driven by our deployment of capital and increased invested balance of our investments and the fact that we had a full year of operations compared to a partial period in the prior year. The size of our investment portfolio at fair value increased from $545.3 million at December 31, 2018 to $3,092.4 million at December 31, 2019.\nWith the exception of three equity investments (which represented 0.45% of the total fair value of the portfolio), all investments were income producing senior secured debt investments.

The average principal debt outstanding increased to $776.6 million at December 31, 2019 from $162.0 million at December 31, 2018.\nThe increase in management fees and income based incentive fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year were driven by our deployment of capital which resulted in a higher level of investments (increased to $3,092.4 million at December 31, 2019 from $545.3 million at December 31, 2018) and pre-incentive fee net investment income.\nWe accrued capital gains incentive fees of $4.2 million in the current year as compared to $0.0 million in the prior year as a result of net realized and unrealized gains as of December 31, 2019. However, none of this amount is payable as of December 31, 2019 under the investment advisory agreement.\nOrganization costs and offering costs include expenses incurred in our initial formation and our Private Offering. Professional fees include legal, rating agencies, audit, tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of us. Administrative service fees represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers, their respective staff and other non-investment professionals that perform duties for us. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, our sub-administrator, subscriptions and other costs. The increase in professional fees, administrative service fees and other general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the deployment of capital and the fact that we had a full year of operations in the current year compared to a partial period in the prior year.\nThe Adviser may elect to make Expense Payments on our behalf, subject to future Reimbursement Payments pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement described above in -Key Components of Our Results of Operations-Expenses.\u201d\nIncome Taxes, Including Excise Taxes\nWe elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90% of the sum of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred $0.5 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of U.S. federal excise tax.\nNet Unrealized Gain (Loss)\nWe fair value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses. Net unrealized gain (loss) was comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized gain (loss) on investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,428) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized gain (loss) on forward purchase obligation </td> <td>222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(222) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized gain (loss) on translation of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies </td> <td>(66) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized gain (loss) on investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,650) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the net unrealized gains on investments were primarily driven by increases in the value of our quoted loan portfolio and non-quoted loan portfolio of $22.8 million and $5.3 million, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the net unrealized losses on investments were primarily driven by decreases in the value of our quoted loan portfolio and non-quoted loan portfolio of $2.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively.\nNet Realized Gain (Loss)\nThe realized gains and losses on fully exited and partially exited investments comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gain (loss) on investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gain (loss) on derivative </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(581) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gain (loss) on investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(581) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated net realized gains of $4.0 million resulting primarily from full or partial sales of quoted loans.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe generate cash from the net proceeds from the drawdown of Capital Commitments, proceeds from net borrowings on our credit facilities and income earned on our debt investments. Other potential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders and proceeds from public or private offerings of debt or equity securities. The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are for (i) originating loans and purchasing senior secured debt investments, (ii) funding the costs of our operations (including fees paid to our Adviser and expense reimbursements paid to our Administrator), (iii) debt service, repayment and other financing costs of our borrowings and (iv) cash distributions to the holders of our shares.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had four and three revolving credit facilities outstanding, respectively, as described in -Borrowings\u201d below. We may from time to time enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to\ntotal indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150%. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had an aggregate amount of $1,454.2 million and $185.0 million of senior securities outstanding and our asset coverage ratio was 215.1% and 227.8%, respectively. The independent members of our Board and our sole initial shareholder approved our asset coverage limit of 150% pursuant to Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act effective September 25, 2018. As of such date, our initial shareholder was the only holder of our shares and it waived the right to receive repurchase offers pursuant to Section 61(a)(2)(D)(ii) of the 1940 Act. We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150% asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2019, taken together with our $820.8 million of available capacity under our credit facilities (subject to borrowing base availability) and our $1,597.6 million of uncalled Capital Commitments is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $65.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $2,558.3 million, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of $3,077.3 million and a decrease in payables for investments purchased of $139.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from sale of investments of $572.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $2,617.6 million during the period, which was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of shares of $1,387.8 million and net borrowings on our credit facilities of $1,269.2 million, partially offset by dividends paid in cash of $35.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $6.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $349.8 million, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of $428.1 million, the purchase of the equity interests in the Syndicated Warehouse (discussed below), net of cash of $24.0 million; partially offset by a decrease in receivables for investments sold of $12.0 million and an increase in payables for investments purchased of $86.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $356.0 million during the period, which was the result of proceeds from the issuance of shares of $239.3 million and net borrowings on our credit facilities of $120.0 million, partially offset by deferred financing costs paid of $2.6 million.\nEquity\nThe following table summarizes the total shares issued and proceeds received related to our capital drawdowns delivered pursuant to the Subscription Agreements for the year ended December 31, 2019 (dollars in millions):\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common Share Issuance Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of Common Shares Issued </td> <td> </td> <td>Aggregate Offering Price </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 24, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>5,666,095 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>142.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 28, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>9,818,817 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>247.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 27, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>12,453,261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>319.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>August 9, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,401,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 25, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>14,686,050 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>377.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 16, 2019 (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>10,474,169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>271.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>54,499,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,393.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)On December 2, 2019, the Company issued a capital call and delivered capital drawdown notices totaling $271.1 million, of which $5.9 million was received subsequent to December 31, 2019 and recorded as a subscription receivable on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nThe following table summarizes the total shares issued and proceeds received related to our initial capitalization and capital drawdowns delivered pursuant to the Subscription Agreements for the year ended December 31, 2018 (dollars in millions):\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common Share Issuance Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Number of\nCommon\nShares Issued </td> <td> </td> <td>Aggregate\nOffering Price </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 14, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 20, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>5,671,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 13, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,950,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>9,621,319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>239.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe entered into Subscription Agreements with a number of investors, including affiliates of our Adviser, providing for the private placement of our shares.

See Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 3. Agreements and Related Party Transactions.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company is required to report its investments for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. The Company values its investments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements ( ASC 820\u201d), which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Due to the inherent uncertainties of valuation, certain estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been realized had a ready market for these investments existed, and these differences could be material. See Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 5. Fair Value Measurements.\u201d\nWhere available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. The Company utilizes mid-market pricing (i.e. mid-point of average bid and ask prices) to value these investments. These market quotations are obtained from independent pricing services, if available; otherwise from at least two principal market makers or primary market dealers. To assess the continuing appropriateness of pricing sources and methodologies, the Adviser regularly performs price verification procedures and issues challenges as necessary to independent pricing services or brokers, and any differences are reviewed in accordance with the valuation procedures. The Adviser does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe market quotations are not reflective of the fair value of an investment. Examples of events that would cause market quotations to not reflect fair value could include cases when a security trades infrequently or not at all, causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale, or in the event of a fire sale\u201d by a distressed seller. All price overrides require approval from the Company's Board.\nWhere prices or inputs are not available or, in the judgment of the Board, not reliable, valuation techniques based on the facts and circumstances of the particular investment will be utilized. Securities that are not publicly traded or for which market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, the Audit Committee of the Board (the Audit Committee\u201d) and independent valuation firms engaged on the recommendation of the Adviser and at the direction of the Board. These valuation approaches involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments' complexity.\nThe Company's Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of the Company's investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or are available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of an investment, which includes, among other procedures, the following:\n\u2022The valuation process begins with each investment being preliminarily valued by the Adviser's valuation team in conjunction with the Adviser's investment professionals responsible for each portfolio investment;\n\u2022In addition, independent valuation firms engaged by the Board prepare valuations of all the Company's investments over a de minimis threshold. The independent valuation firms provide a final range of values on such investments to the Board and the Adviser. The independent valuation firms also provide analyses to support their valuation methodology and calculations;\n\u2022The Adviser's Valuation Committee reviews each valuation recommendation to confirm they have been calculated in accordance with the valuation policy and compares such valuations to the independent valuation firms' valuation ranges to ensure the Adviser's valuations are reasonable;\n\u2022The Valuation Committee makes valuation recommendations to the Audit Committee;\n\u2022The Audit Committee reviews the valuation recommendations made by the Adviser's Valuation Committee, including the independent valuation firms' valuations, and once approved, recommends them for approval by the Board; and\n\u2022The Board reviews the valuation recommendations of the Audit Committee and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Audit Committee, the Adviser's Valuation Committee and, where applicable, the independent valuation firms.\nValuation of each of our investments will generally be made as described above as of the end of each fiscal quarter. In cases where we determine our NAV at times other than a quarter end, we intend to update the value of securities with market quotations to the most recent market quotation. For securities without market quotations, non-quarterly valuations will generally be the most recent quarterly valuation unless a material event has occurred since the most recent quarter end with respect to the investment. Independent valuation firms are generally not used for non-quarterly valuations.\nAs part of the valuation process, the Board takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of its investments, many of which are loans, including and in combination, as relevant, of: (i) the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company, (ii) the nature and realizable value of any collateral, (iii) the portfolio company's ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, (iv) the markets in which the portfolio company does business, (v) a comparison of the portfolio company's securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and (vi) overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity or debt sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation.\nThe Company applies ASC 820, as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would\nbe received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company considers its principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:\n\u2022Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.\n\u2022Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.\n\u2022Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\nTransfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of the inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When an investment is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we, or the independent valuation firm(s), review pricing support provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material.\nIn addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein.\nInterest and Dividend Income Recognition\nInterest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the accretion of discounts and amortizations of premiums. Discounts from and premiums to par value on debt investments purchased are accreted/amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective interest method. The amortized cost of debt investments represents the original cost, including loan origination fees and upfront fees received that are deemed to be an adjustment to yield, adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income in the current period.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies.\nFee income (such as structuring, consent, waiver, amendment, syndication fees as well as fees for managerial assistance rendered by the Company) is recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered.\nDistributions\nTo the extent that the Company has taxable income available, the Company intends to make quarterly distributions to its shareholders. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the record date. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of the Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as the Board may deem relevant from time to time.\nThe Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan, pursuant to which it will reinvest all cash dividends declared by the Board on behalf of its shareholders who do not elect to receive their dividends in cash as provided below. As a result, if the Board and the Company declares, a cash dividend or other distribution, then the Company's shareholders who have not opted out of its dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares as described below, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating shareholder's account to three decimal places. A participating shareholder will receive an amount of shares equal to the amount of the distribution on that participant's shares divided by the most recent quarter-end NAV per share that is available on the date such distribution was paid (unless the Board determines to use the NAV per share as of another time). Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares will generally be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions; however, since their cash distributions will be reinvested, those shareholders will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes. The Company intends to use newly issued shares to implement the plan. Shares issued under the dividend reinvestment plan will not reduce outstanding Capital Commitments.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The Company also has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. So long as the Company maintains its status as a RIC, it generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its shareholders as dividends. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by the Company would represent obligations of the Company's investors and would not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\nThe Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.\nIn addition, based on the excise tax distribution requirements, the Company is subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on undistributed income unless the Company distributes in a timely manner in each taxable year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in prior years. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by the Company that is subject to corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed.", "item_7_truncated": "On December 12, 2018, we entered into an Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. The Expense Support Agreement provides that, at such times as the Adviser determines, the Adviser may pay certain Expense Payments of the Company, provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any of our interest expense. Such Expense Payment must be made in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than forty-five days after a written commitment from the Adviser to pay such expense, and/or by an offset against amounts due from us to the Adviser or its affiliates. Following any calendar quarter in which Available Operating Funds (as defined in the Expense Support Agreement) exceed Excess Operating Funds, we shall pay Reimbursement Payments to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter have been reimbursed. The amount of the Reimbursement Payment for any calendar quarter shall equal the lesser of (i) the Excess Operating Funds in such quarter and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter that have not been previously reimbursed by us to the Adviser. The Expense Support Agreement provides additional restrictions on the amount of each Reimbursement Payment for any calendar quarter. The Adviser may waive its right to receive all or a portion of any Reimbursement Payment in any particular calendar quarter, so that such Reimbursement Payment may be reimbursable in a future calendar quarter.\nWe elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90% of the sum of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payment Date </td> <td> </td> <td>DRIP Shares Value </td> <td> </td> <td>DRIP Shares Issued </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 15, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,605 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>August 14, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,165 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 14, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,894 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>168,664 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPortfolio Company Commitments\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized gain (loss) on investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,428) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized gain (loss) on forward purchase obligation </td> <td>222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(222) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized gain (loss) on translation of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies </td> <td>(66) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized gain (loss) on investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,650) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(3)Under the Jackson Hole Funding Facility, the Company may borrow in U.S. dollars or certain other permitted currencies.

following:\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $65.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $2,558.3 million, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of $3,077.3 million and a decrease in payables for investments purchased of $139.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from sale of investments of $572.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $2,617.6 million during the period, which was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of shares of $1,387.8 million and net borrowings on our credit facilities of $1,269.2 million, partially offset by dividends paid in cash of $35.4 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the net unrealized gains on investments were primarily driven by increases in the value of our quoted loan portfolio and non-quoted loan portfolio of $22.8 million and $5.3 million, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned agreements, we, our Adviser and certain of our Adviser's affiliates have been granted exemptive relief by the SEC to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. See Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 3. Agreements and Related Party Transactions.\u201d\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the net unrealized losses on investments were primarily driven by decreases in the value of our quoted loan portfolio and non-quoted loan portfolio of $2.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively.\nOur investment activity is presented below (information presented herein is at amortized cost unless otherwise indicated) (dollar amounts in thousands):\nIncome Taxes\nWe fair value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses. Net unrealized gain (loss) was comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\u2022Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement.\n(2)The amount available reflects any limitations related to each respective credit facility's borrowing base.\nNet Realized Gain (Loss)\n(1)Computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield plus the annual accretion of discounts or less the annual amortization of premiums, as applicable, on accruing debt included in such securities, divided by (b) total first lien and second lien debt (at fair value or cost, as applicable) included in such securities. Actual yields earned over the life of each investment could differ materially from the yields presented above.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had four and three revolving credit facilities outstanding, respectively, as described in -Borrowings\u201d below. We may from time to time enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to\n\u2022Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.\n\nThe Company applies ASC 820, as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would\nOther Commitments and Contingencies\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nExpenses\n\u2022The Valuation Committee makes valuation recommendations to the Audit Committee;\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $6.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $349.8 million, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of $428.1 million, the purchase of the equity interests in the Syndicated Warehouse (discussed below), net of cash of $24.0 million; partially offset by a decrease in receivables for investments sold of $12.0 million and an increase in payables for investments purchased of $86.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $356.0 million during the period, which was the result of proceeds from the issuance of shares of $239.3 million and net borrowings on our credit facilities of $120.0 million, partially offset by deferred financing costs paid of $2.6 million.\nBorrowings\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the weighted average interest rate on all borrowings outstanding was 4.36% and 5.42% (including unused fees), respectively, and the average principal debt outstanding was $776.6 million and $162.0 million, respectively.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein.\n\nValuation of each of our investments will generally be made as described above as of the end of each fiscal quarter. In cases where we determine our NAV at times other than a quarter end, we intend to update the value of securities with market quotations to the most recent market quotation. For securities without market quotations, non-quarterly valuations will generally be the most recent quarterly valuation unless a material event has occurred since the most recent quarter end with respect to the investment. Independent valuation firms are generally not used for non-quarterly valuations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, total investment income (which includes prepayment premiums and accelerated accretion of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts of $1.6 million and $2.1 million, respectively, which are included within interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations) increased from the prior year primarily driven by our deployment of capital and increased invested balance of our investments and the fact that we had a full year of operations compared to a partial period in the prior year. The size of our investment portfolio at fair value increased from $545.3 million at December 31, 2018 to $3,092.4 million at December 31, 2019.\nUnder normal market conditions, we generally invest at least 80% of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in secured debt investments (including investments that are secured by equity interests) and our portfolio is composed primarily of first lien senior secured and unitranche loans (including first out/last out loans), generally with total investment sizes less than $300 million, which criteria may change from time to time. To a lesser extent, we have and may continue to also invest in second lien, third lien, unsecured or subordinated loans, generally with total investment sizes less than $100 million, which criteria may change from time to time, and other debt and equity securities. We do not currently focus on investments in issuers that are distressed or in need of rescue financing.\nThe following table summarizes the total shares issued and proceeds received related to our initial capitalization and capital drawdowns delivered pursuant to the Subscription Agreements for the year ended December 31, 2018 (dollars in millions):\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nFair Value Measurements\nFor additional information on our Warehousing Transactions see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nOur outstanding debt obligations were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nInterest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the accretion of discounts and amortizations of premiums. Discounts from and premiums to par value on debt investments purchased are accreted/amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective interest method. The amortized cost of debt investments represents the original cost, including loan origination fees and upfront fees received that are deemed to be an adjustment to yield, adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income in the current period.\n\nFor additional information on our debt obligations see \"Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 6. Borrowings.\u201d\nIn addition, we generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, and possibly consulting fees.\nFrom time to time, we may become a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of its business. At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, management is not aware of any pending or threatened litigation.\nWhere available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. The Company utilizes mid-market pricing (i.e. mid-point of average bid and ask prices) to value these investments. These market quotations are obtained from independent pricing services, if available; otherwise from at least two principal market makers or primary market dealers. To assess the continuing appropriateness of pricing sources and methodologies, the Adviser regularly performs price verification procedures and issues challenges as necessary to independent pricing services or brokers, and any differences are reviewed in accordance with the valuation procedures. The Adviser does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe market quotations are not reflective of the fair value of an investment. Examples of events that would cause market quotations to not reflect fair value could include cases when a security trades infrequently or not at all, causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale, or in the event of a fire sale\u201d by a distressed seller. All price overrides require approval from the Company's Board.\nThe increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, was driven by increased borrowings under our credit facilities related to increased deployment of capital for investments and the fact that we had a full year of operations compared to a partial period in the prior year. The average principal debt outstanding increased to $776.6 million at December 31, 2019 from $162.0 million at December 31, 2018.\nThe following table represents our operating results (dollar amounts in thousands):\nThe Company is required to report its investments for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. The Company values its investments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements ( ASC 820\u201d), which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Due to the inherent uncertainties of valuation, certain estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been realized had a ready market for these investments existed, and these differences could be material. See Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 5. Fair Value Measurements.\u201d\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies.\nCosts and expenses of the Administrator and the Adviser that are eligible for reimbursement by us will be reasonably allocated to the Company on the basis of time spent, assets under management, usage rates, proportionate holdings, a combination thereof or other reasonable methods determined by the Administrator in accordance with policies adopted by the Board.\nThe following table summarizes the total shares issued and proceeds received related to our capital drawdowns delivered pursuant to the Subscription Agreements for the year ended December 31, 2019 (dollars in millions):\nWe entered into two Warehousing Transactions whereby we agreed, subject to certain conditions, to purchase certain assets from parties unaffiliated with the Adviser. Such Warehousing Transactions were designed to assist us in deploying capital upon receipt of drawdown proceeds. The Middle Market Warehouse related primarily to originated or anchor investments in middle market loans. The Syndicated Warehouse related primarily to broadly syndicated loans prior to the acquisition of the equity interests of the Syndicated Warehouse by us and merger of the Syndicated Warehouse with our wholly-owned subsidiary, as described below. See- Item 1A.-Risk Factors - Risks Related to an Investment in the Shares - Risks related to the Warehousing Transactions.\u201d\nThe Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan, pursuant to which it will reinvest all cash dividends declared by the Board on behalf of its shareholders who do not elect to receive their dividends in cash as provided below. As a result, if the Board and the Company declares, a cash dividend or other distribution, then the Company's shareholders who have not opted out of its dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares as described below, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating shareholder's account to three decimal places. A participating shareholder will receive an amount of shares equal to the amount of the distribution on that participant's shares divided by the most recent quarter-end NAV per share that is available on the date such distribution was paid (unless the Board determines to use the NAV per share as of another time). Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares will generally be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions; however, since their cash distributions will be reinvested, those shareholders will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes. The Company intends to use newly issued shares to implement the plan. Shares issued under the dividend reinvestment plan will not reduce outstanding Capital Commitments.\nOur contractual obligations consisted of the following as of December 31, 2019 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nWe accrued capital gains incentive fees of $4.2 million in the current year as compared to $0.0 million in the prior year as a result of net realized and unrealized gains as of December 31, 2019. However, none of this amount is payable as of December 31, 2019 under the investment advisory agreement.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred $0.5 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of U.S. federal excise tax.\nmarket loans. The Syndicated Warehouse related primarily to broadly syndicated loans. Both the Middle Market Warehouse and the Syndicated Warehouse have been terminated.\nDistributions\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2019, taken together with our $820.8 million of available capacity under our credit facilities (subject to borrowing base availability) and our $1,597.6 million of uncalled Capital Commitments is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term.\n\nInvestment Income\n\u2022The valuation process begins with each investment being preliminarily valued by the Adviser's valuation team in conjunction with the Adviser's investment professionals responsible for each portfolio investment;\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated net realized gains of $4.0 million resulting primarily from full or partial sales of quoted loans.\nRevenues\n\u2022the Administration Agreement; and\n(1)The unused portion is the amount upon which commitment fees, if any, are based.\nRelated-Party Transactions\n\ntotal indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150%. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had an aggregate amount of $1,454.2 million and $185.0 million of senior securities outstanding and our asset coverage ratio was 215.1% and 227.8%, respectively. The independent members of our Board and our sole initial shareholder approved our asset coverage limit of 150% pursuant to Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act effective September 25, 2018. As of such date, our initial shareholder was the only holder of our shares and it waived the right to receive repurchase offers pursuant to Section 61(a)(2)(D)(ii) of the 1940 Act. We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150% asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund.\nContractual Obligations\nEquity\nWe focus primarily on loans and securities, including syndicated loans, of private U.S. companies, specifically small and middle market companies, which we define as companies with annual revenue of $50 million to $2.5 billion, at the time of investment. Specifically, for our originated investments, we target companies with $25 million to $75 million of EBITDA. In many market environments, we believe such a focus offers an opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns.\nAs part of the valuation process, the Board takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of its investments, many of which are loans, including and in combination, as relevant, of: (i) the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company, (ii) the nature and realizable value of any collateral, (iii) the portfolio company's ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, (iv) the markets in which the portfolio company does business, (v) a comparison of the portfolio company's securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and (vi) overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity or debt sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation.\n\u2022The Adviser's Valuation Committee reviews each valuation recommendation to confirm they have been calculated in accordance with the valuation policy and compares such valuations to the independent valuation firms' valuation ranges to ensure the Adviser's valuations are reasonable;\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOur investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation.\n\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nExpenses\nWe entered into Subscription Agreements with a number of investors, including affiliates of our Adviser, providing for the private placement of our shares. Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase our shares up to the amount of their respective capital commitment on an as-needed basis each time we deliver a drawdown notice to our investors. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had received Capital Commitments totaling $3,230.6 million ($1,597.6 million remaining undrawn), of which $74.5 million ($36.7 million remaining undrawn) were from affiliates of the Adviser. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had received Capital Commitments totaling $952.2 million ($712.9 million remaining undrawn), of which $15.0 million ($6.9 million remaining undrawn) were from affiliates of the Adviser.\nInvestments\nExpenses were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\u2022Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\n\nInterest and Dividend Income Recognition\nbe received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company considers its principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:\n\nThe realized gains and losses on fully exited and partially exited investments comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands):\n(2)As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the weighted average total portfolio yield at cost was 8.60% and 8.70%, respectively. The weighted average total portfolio yield at fair value was 8.53% and 8.76%, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes our distributions declared and payable for the year ended December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands except per share amounts):\nIncome Taxes, Including Excise Taxes\n\u2022In addition, independent valuation firms engaged by the Board prepare valuations of all the Company's investments over a de minimis threshold. The independent valuation firms provide a final range of values on such investments to the Board and the Adviser. The independent valuation firms also provide analyses to support their valuation methodology and calculations;\nThe increase in management fees and income based incentive fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year were driven by our deployment of capital which resulted in a higher level of investments (increased to $3,092.4 million at December 31, 2019 from $545.3 million at December 31, 2018) and pre-incentive fee net investment income.\nTransfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of the inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When an investment is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we, or the independent valuation firm(s), review pricing support provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs.\nIn addition, based on the excise tax distribution requirements, the Company is subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on undistributed income unless the Company distributes in a timely manner in each taxable year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in prior years. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by the Company that is subject to corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed.\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\n\nWith the exception of three equity investments (which represented 0.45% of the total fair value of the portfolio), all investments were income producing senior secured debt investments. There were no loans on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\n\nOur investment portfolio contains and is expected to continue to contain debt investments which are in the form of lines of credit or delayed draw commitments, which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with underlying loan agreements. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had delayed draw term loans with an aggregate of $179.4 million and $54.7 million of unfunded commitments, respectively.\nWe are a Delaware statutory trust structured as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. We are managed by our Adviser. The Administrator will provide the administrative services necessary for us to operate.\nFee income (such as structuring, consent, waiver, amendment, syndication fees as well as fees for managerial assistance rendered by the Company) is recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered.\nInvestment income was as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nWe entered into two warehousing transactions whereby we, subject to certain conditions, to purchase certain assets from parties unaffiliated with the Adviser. Such warehousing transactions were designed to assist us in deploying capital upon receipt of drawdown proceeds. The Middle Market Warehouse related primarily to originated or anchor investments in middle\n\nWith respect to costs incurred in connection with the Company's organization and offering costs, if actual organization and offering costs incurred exceed 0.10% of our total Capital Commitments, the Adviser or its affiliates will bear the excess costs. To the extent our Capital Commitments later increase, the Adviser or its affiliates may be reimbursed for past payments of excess organization and offering costs made on our behalf provided that the total organization and offering costs borne by us do not exceed 0.10% of total Capital Commitments and provided further that the Adviser or its affiliates may not be reimbursed for payment of excess organization and offering expenses that were incurred more than three years prior to the proposed reimbursement. Any sales load, platform fees, servicing fees or similar fees or expenses charged directly to an investor in our Private Offering by a placement agent or similar party will not be considered organization or offering expenses of the Company for purposes of our cap on organization and offering expenses.\nTo the extent that the Company has taxable income available, the Company intends to make quarterly distributions to its shareholders. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the record date. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of the Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as the Board may deem relevant from time to time.\nThe composition of our investment portfolio at cost and fair value was as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nHedging\nWe generate revenues in the form of interest income from the debt securities we hold and dividends and capital appreciation on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. Our debt investments typically have a term of five to eight years and bear interest at floating rates on the basis of a benchmark such as LIBOR. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we may receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date.\nThe Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.\nWarehousing Transactions\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The Company also has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. So long as the Company maintains its status as a RIC, it generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its shareholders as dividends. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by the Company would represent obligations of the Company's investors and would not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nResults of Operations\nrequirements, may include the use of futures, options and forward contracts. We will bear the costs incurred in connection with entering into, administering and settling any such derivative contracts. There can be no assurance any hedging strategy we employ will be successful.\nFrom time to time, the Adviser, the Administrator or their affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse the Adviser, Administrator or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. From time to time, the Adviser or the Administrator may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. In this regard, the Administrator has waived the right to be reimbursed for rent and related occupancy costs. However, the Administrator may seek reimbursement for such costs in future periods. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our shareholders, subject to the cap on organization and offering expenses described above.\nWhere prices or inputs are not available or, in the judgment of the Board, not reliable, valuation techniques based on the facts and circumstances of the particular investment will be utilized. Securities that are not publicly traded or for which market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, the Audit Committee of the Board (the Audit Committee\u201d) and independent valuation firms engaged on the recommendation of the Adviser and at the direction of the Board. These valuation approaches involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments' complexity.\nOur level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, trading prices of loans and other securities and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.\n\u2022The Audit Committee reviews the valuation recommendations made by the Adviser's Valuation Committee, including the independent valuation firms' valuations, and once approved, recommends them for approval by the Board; and\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income.\nWe may, but are not required to, enter into interest rate, foreign exchange or other derivative agreements to hedge interest rate, currency, credit or other risks, but we do not generally intend to enter into any such derivative agreements for speculative purposes. Any derivative agreements entered into for speculative purposes are not expected to be material to our business or results of operations. These hedging activities, which will be in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory", "item_7_text": "On December 12, 2018, we entered into an Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. The Expense Support Agreement provides that, at such times as the Adviser determines, the Adviser may pay certain Expense Payments of the Company, provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any of our interest expense. Such Expense Payment must be made in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than forty-five days after a written commitment from the Adviser to pay such expense, and/or by an offset against amounts due from us to the Adviser or its affiliates. Following any calendar quarter in which Available Operating Funds (as defined in the Expense Support Agreement) exceed Excess Operating Funds, we shall pay Reimbursement Payments to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter have been reimbursed. The amount of the Reimbursement Payment for any calendar quarter shall equal the lesser of (i) the Excess Operating Funds in such quarter and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter that have not been previously reimbursed by us to the Adviser. The Expense Support Agreement provides additional restrictions on the amount of each Reimbursement Payment for any calendar quarter. The Adviser may waive its right to receive all or a portion of any Reimbursement Payment in any particular calendar quarter, so that such Reimbursement Payment may be reimbursable in a future calendar quarter.\nWe elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90% of the sum of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes.\nPortfolio Company Commitments\n(3)Under the Jackson Hole Funding Facility, the Company may borrow in U.S. dollars or certain other permitted currencies. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had borrowings denominated in Euros (EUR) of 23.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, all borrowings outstanding were in USD.\nNet Unrealized Gain (Loss)\nPursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan, the following table summarize the amounts received and shares issued to shareholders who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan during the year ended December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands except per share amounts):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we acquired $3,298.8 million aggregate principal amount of investments (including $173.0 million of remaining unfunded commitments), $3,243.2 million of which was first lien debt, $42.1 million of which was second lien debt and $13.5 million of which was equity. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired $616.9 million aggregate principal amount of investments (including $54.7 million of unfunded commitments), $610.5 million of which was first lien debt and $6.4 million of which was second lien debt.\nDistributions and Dividend Reinvestment\nThe Adviser may elect to make Expense Payments on our behalf, subject to future Reimbursement Payments pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement described above in -Key Components of Our Results of Operations-Expenses.\u201d\n\u2022Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.\nOrganization costs and offering costs include expenses incurred in our initial formation and our Private Offering. Professional fees include legal, rating agencies, audit, tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of us. Administrative service fees represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers, their respective staff and other non-investment professionals that perform duties for us. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, our sub-administrator, subscriptions and other costs. The increase in professional fees, administrative service fees and other general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the deployment of capital and the fact that we had a full year of operations in the current year compared to a partial period in the prior year.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe generate cash from the net proceeds from the drawdown of Capital Commitments, proceeds from net borrowings on our credit facilities and income earned on our debt investments. Other potential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders and proceeds from public or private offerings of debt or equity securities. The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are for (i) originating loans and purchasing senior secured debt investments, (ii) funding the costs of our operations (including fees paid to our Adviser and expense reimbursements paid to our Administrator), (iii) debt service, repayment and other financing costs of our borrowings and (iv) cash distributions to the holders of our shares.\nWe commenced our loan origination and investment activities contemporaneously with the Initial Drawdown on November 20, 2018. The proceeds from the Initial Drawdown and availability under our credit facilities provided us with the necessary seed capital to commence operations. See -Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources-Borrowings.\u201d We anticipate raising additional equity capital for investment purposes through additional closings under the Private Offering.\nThe discussion and analysis contained in this section refers to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K Risk Factors.\u201d Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed under Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The year ended December 31, 2018 represents the period from November 20, 2018 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2018.\nExcept as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (a) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; (b) our allocable portion of compensation, overhead (including rent, office equipment and utilities) and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement, including but not limited to: (i) our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs; (ii) investor relations, legal, operations and other non-investment professionals at the Administrator that perform duties for us; and (iii) any internal audit group personnel of Blackstone or any of its affiliates; and (c) all other expenses of our operations and transactions.\n\n\u2022The Board reviews the valuation recommendations of the Audit Committee and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Audit Committee, the Adviser's Valuation Committee and, where applicable, the independent valuation firms.\n\u2022the Investment Advisory Agreement; and\nOverview and Investment Framework\nAs of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, no loans in the portfolio were on non-accrual status.\n(1)On December 2, 2019, the Company issued a capital call and delivered capital drawdown notices totaling $271.1 million, of which $5.9 million was received subsequent to December 31, 2019 and recorded as a subscription receivable on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not declare or pay any distributions.\n\nThe Company's Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of the Company's investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or are available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of an investment, which includes, among other procedures, the following:\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $65.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $2,558.3 million, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of $3,077.3 million and a decrease in payables for investments purchased of $139.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from sale of investments of $572.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $2,617.6 million during the period, which was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of shares of $1,387.8 million and net borrowings on our credit facilities of $1,269.2 million, partially offset by dividends paid in cash of $35.4 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the net unrealized gains on investments were primarily driven by increases in the value of our quoted loan portfolio and non-quoted loan portfolio of $22.8 million and $5.3 million, respectively.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned agreements, we, our Adviser and certain of our Adviser's affiliates have been granted exemptive relief by the SEC to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. See Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 3. Agreements and Related Party Transactions.\u201d\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the net unrealized losses on investments were primarily driven by decreases in the value of our quoted loan portfolio and non-quoted loan portfolio of $2.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively.\nOur investment activity is presented below (information presented herein is at amortized cost unless otherwise indicated) (dollar amounts in thousands):\nIncome Taxes\nWe fair value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses. Net unrealized gain (loss) was comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\u2022Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement.\n(2)The amount available reflects any limitations related to each respective credit facility's borrowing base.\nNet Realized Gain (Loss)\n(1)Computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield plus the annual accretion of discounts or less the annual amortization of premiums, as applicable, on accruing debt included in such securities, divided by (b) total first lien and second lien debt (at fair value or cost, as applicable) included in such securities. Actual yields earned over the life of each investment could differ materially from the yields presented above.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had four and three revolving credit facilities outstanding, respectively, as described in -Borrowings\u201d below. We may from time to time enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to\n\u2022Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.\n\nThe Company applies ASC 820, as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would\nOther Commitments and Contingencies\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nExpenses\n\u2022The Valuation Committee makes valuation recommendations to the Audit Committee;\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $6.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $349.8 million, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of $428.1 million, the purchase of the equity interests in the Syndicated Warehouse (discussed below), net of cash of $24.0 million; partially offset by a decrease in receivables for investments sold of $12.0 million and an increase in payables for investments purchased of $86.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $356.0 million during the period, which was the result of proceeds from the issuance of shares of $239.3 million and net borrowings on our credit facilities of $120.0 million, partially offset by deferred financing costs paid of $2.6 million.\nBorrowings\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the weighted average interest rate on all borrowings outstanding was 4.36% and 5.42% (including unused fees), respectively, and the average principal debt outstanding was $776.6 million and $162.0 million, respectively.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein.\n\nValuation of each of our investments will generally be made as described above as of the end of each fiscal quarter. In cases where we determine our NAV at times other than a quarter end, we intend to update the value of securities with market quotations to the most recent market quotation. For securities without market quotations, non-quarterly valuations will generally be the most recent quarterly valuation unless a material event has occurred since the most recent quarter end with respect to the investment. Independent valuation firms are generally not used for non-quarterly valuations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, total investment income (which includes prepayment premiums and accelerated accretion of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts of $1.6 million and $2.1 million, respectively, which are included within interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations) increased from the prior year primarily driven by our deployment of capital and increased invested balance of our investments and the fact that we had a full year of operations compared to a partial period in the prior year. The size of our investment portfolio at fair value increased from $545.3 million at December 31, 2018 to $3,092.4 million at December 31, 2019.\nUnder normal market conditions, we generally invest at least 80% of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in secured debt investments (including investments that are secured by equity interests) and our portfolio is composed primarily of first lien senior secured and unitranche loans (including first out/last out loans), generally with total investment sizes less than $300 million, which criteria may change from time to time. To a lesser extent, we have and may continue to also invest in second lien, third lien, unsecured or subordinated loans, generally with total investment sizes less than $100 million, which criteria may change from time to time, and other debt and equity securities. We do not currently focus on investments in issuers that are distressed or in need of rescue financing.\nThe following table summarizes the total shares issued and proceeds received related to our initial capitalization and capital drawdowns delivered pursuant to the Subscription Agreements for the year ended December 31, 2018 (dollars in millions):\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nFair Value Measurements\nFor additional information on our Warehousing Transactions see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nOur outstanding debt obligations were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nInterest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the accretion of discounts and amortizations of premiums. Discounts from and premiums to par value on debt investments purchased are accreted/amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective interest method. The amortized cost of debt investments represents the original cost, including loan origination fees and upfront fees received that are deemed to be an adjustment to yield, adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income in the current period.\n\nFor additional information on our debt obligations see \"Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 6. Borrowings.\u201d\nIn addition, we generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, and possibly consulting fees.\nFrom time to time, we may become a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of its business. At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, management is not aware of any pending or threatened litigation.\nWhere available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. The Company utilizes mid-market pricing (i.e. mid-point of average bid and ask prices) to value these investments. These market quotations are obtained from independent pricing services, if available; otherwise from at least two principal market makers or primary market dealers. To assess the continuing appropriateness of pricing sources and methodologies, the Adviser regularly performs price verification procedures and issues challenges as necessary to independent pricing services or brokers, and any differences are reviewed in accordance with the valuation procedures. The Adviser does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe market quotations are not reflective of the fair value of an investment. Examples of events that would cause market quotations to not reflect fair value could include cases when a security trades infrequently or not at all, causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale, or in the event of a fire sale\u201d by a distressed seller. All price overrides require approval from the Company's Board.\nThe increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, was driven by increased borrowings under our credit facilities related to increased deployment of capital for investments and the fact that we had a full year of operations compared to a partial period in the prior year. The average principal debt outstanding increased to $776.6 million at December 31, 2019 from $162.0 million at December 31, 2018.\nThe following table represents our operating results (dollar amounts in thousands):\nThe Company is required to report its investments for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. The Company values its investments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements ( ASC 820\u201d), which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Due to the inherent uncertainties of valuation, certain estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been realized had a ready market for these investments existed, and these differences could be material. See Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 5. Fair Value Measurements.\u201d\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies.\nCosts and expenses of the Administrator and the Adviser that are eligible for reimbursement by us will be reasonably allocated to the Company on the basis of time spent, assets under management, usage rates, proportionate holdings, a combination thereof or other reasonable methods determined by the Administrator in accordance with policies adopted by the Board.\nThe following table summarizes the total shares issued and proceeds received related to our capital drawdowns delivered pursuant to the Subscription Agreements for the year ended December 31, 2019 (dollars in millions):\nWe entered into two Warehousing Transactions whereby we agreed, subject to certain conditions, to purchase certain assets from parties unaffiliated with the Adviser. Such Warehousing Transactions were designed to assist us in deploying capital upon receipt of drawdown proceeds. The Middle Market Warehouse related primarily to originated or anchor investments in middle market loans. The Syndicated Warehouse related primarily to broadly syndicated loans prior to the acquisition of the equity interests of the Syndicated Warehouse by us and merger of the Syndicated Warehouse with our wholly-owned subsidiary, as described below. See- Item 1A.-Risk Factors - Risks Related to an Investment in the Shares - Risks related to the Warehousing Transactions.\u201d\nThe Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan, pursuant to which it will reinvest all cash dividends declared by the Board on behalf of its shareholders who do not elect to receive their dividends in cash as provided below. As a result, if the Board and the Company declares, a cash dividend or other distribution, then the Company's shareholders who have not opted out of its dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares as described below, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating shareholder's account to three decimal places. A participating shareholder will receive an amount of shares equal to the amount of the distribution on that participant's shares divided by the most recent quarter-end NAV per share that is available on the date such distribution was paid (unless the Board determines to use the NAV per share as of another time). Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares will generally be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions; however, since their cash distributions will be reinvested, those shareholders will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes. The Company intends to use newly issued shares to implement the plan. Shares issued under the dividend reinvestment plan will not reduce outstanding Capital Commitments.\nOur contractual obligations consisted of the following as of December 31, 2019 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nWe accrued capital gains incentive fees of $4.2 million in the current year as compared to $0.0 million in the prior year as a result of net realized and unrealized gains as of December 31, 2019. However, none of this amount is payable as of December 31, 2019 under the investment advisory agreement.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred $0.5 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of U.S. federal excise tax.\nmarket loans. The Syndicated Warehouse related primarily to broadly syndicated loans. Both the Middle Market Warehouse and the Syndicated Warehouse have been terminated.\nDistributions\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2019, taken together with our $820.8 million of available capacity under our credit facilities (subject to borrowing base availability) and our $1,597.6 million of uncalled Capital Commitments is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term.\n\nInvestment Income\n\u2022The valuation process begins with each investment being preliminarily valued by the Adviser's valuation team in conjunction with the Adviser's investment professionals responsible for each portfolio investment;\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated net realized gains of $4.0 million resulting primarily from full or partial sales of quoted loans.\nRevenues\n\u2022the Administration Agreement; and\n(1)The unused portion is the amount upon which commitment fees, if any, are based.\nRelated-Party Transactions\n\ntotal indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150%. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had an aggregate amount of $1,454.2 million and $185.0 million of senior securities outstanding and our asset coverage ratio was 215.1% and 227.8%, respectively. The independent members of our Board and our sole initial shareholder approved our asset coverage limit of 150% pursuant to Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act effective September 25, 2018. As of such date, our initial shareholder was the only holder of our shares and it waived the right to receive repurchase offers pursuant to Section 61(a)(2)(D)(ii) of the 1940 Act. We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150% asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund.\nContractual Obligations\nEquity\nWe focus primarily on loans and securities, including syndicated loans, of private U.S. companies, specifically small and middle market companies, which we define as companies with annual revenue of $50 million to $2.5 billion, at the time of investment. Specifically, for our originated investments, we target companies with $25 million to $75 million of EBITDA. In many market environments, we believe such a focus offers an opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns.\nAs part of the valuation process, the Board takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of its investments, many of which are loans, including and in combination, as relevant, of: (i) the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company, (ii) the nature and realizable value of any collateral, (iii) the portfolio company's ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, (iv) the markets in which the portfolio company does business, (v) a comparison of the portfolio company's securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and (vi) overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity or debt sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation.\n\u2022The Adviser's Valuation Committee reviews each valuation recommendation to confirm they have been calculated in accordance with the valuation policy and compares such valuations to the independent valuation firms' valuation ranges to ensure the Adviser's valuations are reasonable;\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOur investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation.\n\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nExpenses\nWe entered into Subscription Agreements with a number of investors, including affiliates of our Adviser, providing for the private placement of our shares. Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase our shares up to the amount of their respective capital commitment on an as-needed basis each time we deliver a drawdown notice to our investors. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had received Capital Commitments totaling $3,230.6 million ($1,597.6 million remaining undrawn), of which $74.5 million ($36.7 million remaining undrawn) were from affiliates of the Adviser. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had received Capital Commitments totaling $952.2 million ($712.9 million remaining undrawn), of which $15.0 million ($6.9 million remaining undrawn) were from affiliates of the Adviser.\nInvestments\nExpenses were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\u2022Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\n\nInterest and Dividend Income Recognition\nbe received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company considers its principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:\n\nThe realized gains and losses on fully exited and partially exited investments comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands):\n(2)As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the weighted average total portfolio yield at cost was 8.60% and 8.70%, respectively. The weighted average total portfolio yield at fair value was 8.53% and 8.76%, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes our distributions declared and payable for the year ended December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands except per share amounts):\nIncome Taxes, Including Excise Taxes\n\u2022In addition, independent valuation firms engaged by the Board prepare valuations of all the Company's investments over a de minimis threshold. The independent valuation firms provide a final range of values on such investments to the Board and the Adviser. The independent valuation firms also provide analyses to support their valuation methodology and calculations;\nThe increase in management fees and income based incentive fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year were driven by our deployment of capital which resulted in a higher level of investments (increased to $3,092.4 million at December 31, 2019 from $545.3 million at December 31, 2018) and pre-incentive fee net investment income.\nTransfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of the inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When an investment is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we, or the independent valuation firm(s), review pricing support provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs.\nIn addition, based on the excise tax distribution requirements, the Company is subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on undistributed income unless the Company distributes in a timely manner in each taxable year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in prior years. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by the Company that is subject to corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed.\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\n\nWith the exception of three equity investments (which represented 0.45% of the total fair value of the portfolio), all investments were income producing senior secured debt investments. There were no loans on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\n\nOur investment portfolio contains and is expected to continue to contain debt investments which are in the form of lines of credit or delayed draw commitments, which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with underlying loan agreements. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had delayed draw term loans with an aggregate of $179.4 million and $54.7 million of unfunded commitments, respectively.\nWe are a Delaware statutory trust structured as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. We are managed by our Adviser. The Administrator will provide the administrative services necessary for us to operate.\nFee income (such as structuring, consent, waiver, amendment, syndication fees as well as fees for managerial assistance rendered by the Company) is recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered.\nInvestment income was as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nWe entered into two warehousing transactions whereby we, subject to certain conditions, to purchase certain assets from parties unaffiliated with the Adviser. Such warehousing transactions were designed to assist us in deploying capital upon receipt of drawdown proceeds. The Middle Market Warehouse related primarily to originated or anchor investments in middle\n\nWith respect to costs incurred in connection with the Company's organization and offering costs, if actual organization and offering costs incurred exceed 0.10% of our total Capital Commitments, the Adviser or its affiliates will bear the excess costs. To the extent our Capital Commitments later increase, the Adviser or its affiliates may be reimbursed for past payments of excess organization and offering costs made on our behalf provided that the total organization and offering costs borne by us do not exceed 0.10% of total Capital Commitments and provided further that the Adviser or its affiliates may not be reimbursed for payment of excess organization and offering expenses that were incurred more than three years prior to the proposed reimbursement. Any sales load, platform fees, servicing fees or similar fees or expenses charged directly to an investor in our Private Offering by a placement agent or similar party will not be considered organization or offering expenses of the Company for purposes of our cap on organization and offering expenses.\nTo the extent that the Company has taxable income available, the Company intends to make quarterly distributions to its shareholders. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the record date. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of the Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as the Board may deem relevant from time to time.\nThe composition of our investment portfolio at cost and fair value was as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nHedging\nWe generate revenues in the form of interest income from the debt securities we hold and dividends and capital appreciation on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. Our debt investments typically have a term of five to eight years and bear interest at floating rates on the basis of a benchmark such as LIBOR. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we may receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. In some cases, our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date.\nThe Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.\nWarehousing Transactions\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The Company also has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. So long as the Company maintains its status as a RIC, it generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its shareholders as dividends. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by the Company would represent obligations of the Company's investors and would not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nResults of Operations\nrequirements, may include the use of futures, options and forward contracts. We will bear the costs incurred in connection with entering into, administering and settling any such derivative contracts. There can be no assurance any hedging strategy we employ will be successful.\nFrom time to time, the Adviser, the Administrator or their affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse the Adviser, Administrator or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. From time to time, the Adviser or the Administrator may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. In this regard, the Administrator has waived the right to be reimbursed for rent and related occupancy costs. However, the Administrator may seek reimbursement for such costs in future periods. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our shareholders, subject to the cap on organization and offering expenses described above.\nWhere prices or inputs are not available or, in the judgment of the Board, not reliable, valuation techniques based on the facts and circumstances of the particular investment will be utilized. Securities that are not publicly traded or for which market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, the Audit Committee of the Board (the Audit Committee\u201d) and independent valuation firms engaged on the recommendation of the Adviser and at the direction of the Board. These valuation approaches involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments' complexity.\nOur level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, trading prices of loans and other securities and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.\n\u2022The Audit Committee reviews the valuation recommendations made by the Adviser's Valuation Committee, including the independent valuation firms' valuations, and once approved, recommends them for approval by the Board; and\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income.\nWe may, but are not required to, enter into interest rate, foreign exchange or other derivative agreements to hedge interest rate, currency, credit or other risks, but we do not generally intend to enter into any such derivative agreements for speculative purposes. Any derivative agreements entered into for speculative purposes are not expected to be material to our business or results of operations.
