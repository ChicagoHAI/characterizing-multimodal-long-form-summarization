Activity levels are driven by traditional energy industry activity indicators, which include current and expected commodity prices, drilling rig counts, footage drilled, well counts, and our customers' spending levels allocated to exploratory and development drilling.\nHistorical market indicators are listed below:\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Worldwide rig count (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. (land and offshore)\n</td> <td>944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>875\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International (2)\n</td> <td>1,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>948\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commodity prices (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil (Brent) per bbl\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crude oil (West Texas Intermediate) per bbl\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas (Henry Hub) per mcf\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Estimate of drilling activity as measured by the average active rig count for the periods indicated - Source: Baker Hughes Rig Count.\n(2) Excludes Canadian rig count.\n(3) Average daily commodity prices for the periods indicated based on NYMEX front-month composite energy prices.\nChapter 11 Emergence\nOn December 12, 2018 (the Petition Date\u201d), Parker and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors\u201d) filed a prearranged plan of reorganization (the Plan\u201d) and commenced voluntary petitions under chapter 11 (the Chapter 11 Cases\u201d) of title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code\u201d) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the Bankruptcy Court\u201d). The Plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on March 7, 2019, and the Debtors emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings on March 26, 2019 (the Plan Effective Date\u201d).\nOn December 12, 2018, prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors entered into a restructuring support agreement (as amended on January 28, 2019, the RSA\u201d) with certain significant holders of (1) 7.50% Senior Notes, due 2020 (the 7.50% Note Holders\u201d) issued pursuant to the indenture (the 7.50% Notes Indenture\u201d) dated July 30, 2013 (the 7.50% Notes\u201d), by and among Parker Drilling, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the Trustee\u201d), (2) 6.75% Senior Notes, due 2022 (the 6.75% Note Holders\u201d) issued pursuant to the indenture (the 6.75% Notes Indenture\u201d) dated January 22, 2014 (the 6.75% Notes\u201d and together with the 7.50% Notes, the Senior Notes\u201d), by and among Parker Drilling, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and the Trustee, (3) Parker Drilling's existing common stock (the Predecessor Common Stock\u201d) and (4) Parker Drilling's 7.25% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (the Predecessor Preferred Stock\u201d and such holders to support a restructuring (the Restructuring\u201d) on the terms set forth in the Plan.\nPlan of Reorganization\nIn accordance with the Plan, on the Plan Effective Date:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>the Company appointed new members to the Successor's board of directors to replace directors of the Predecessor;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>the Company issued:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>2,827,323 shares of Successor Common Stock pro rata to 7.50% Note Holders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>5,178,860 shares of Successor Common Stock pro rata to 6.75% Note Holders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>90,558 shares of Successor Common Stock and 1,032,073 Successor warrants to purchase 1,032,073 shares of Successor Common Stock pro rata to holders of the Predecessor Preferred Stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>135,838 shares of Successor Common Stock and 1,548,109 Successor warrants to purchase 1,548,109 shares of Successor Common Stock pro rata to holders of the Predecessor Common Stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>504,577 shares of Successor Common Stock to commitment parties under that certain Backstop Commitment Agreement, dated December 12, 2018 and amended and restated on January 28, 2019, (as amended and restated, the Backstop Commitment Agreement\u201d) in respect of the commitment premium due thereunder;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>1,403,910 shares of Successor Common Stock to the commitment parties under the Backstop Commitment Agreement in connection with their backstop obligation thereunder to purchase unsubscribed shares of Successor Common Stock; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>4,903,308 shares of Successor Common Stock to participants in the rights offering extended by Parker to the applicable classes under the Plan (including to the commitment parties party to the Backstop Commitment Agreement); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>all of the Company's agreements, instruments and other documents evidencing or relating to, or otherwise connected with, any of the Predecessor's equity interests outstanding prior to the Plan Effective Date were cancelled and all such equity interests have no further force or effect.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Fresh Start Accounting\nUpon emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting ( Fresh Start Accounting\u201d) in accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 852, Reorganizations ( Topic 852\u201d), which resulted in the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. See Note 2 - Chapter 11 Emergence and Note 3 - Fresh Start Accounting for further details. We evaluated the events between March 26, 2019 and March 31, 2019 and concluded that the use of an accounting convenience date of March 31, 2019, (the Fresh Start Reporting Date\u201d) would not have a material impact on our results of operations or balance sheet. As such, the application of fresh start accounting was reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019, and fresh start accounting adjustments related thereto were included in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019.\nReferences to Successor\u201d relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company as of and subsequent to March 31, 2019. References to Predecessor\u201d relate to the financial position of the Company prior to, and results of operations through and including, March 31, 2019. As a result of the adoption of Fresh Start Accounting and the effects of the implementation of the Plan, the Company's consolidated financial statements of the Successor (as of and subsequent to March 31, 2019), are not comparable to its consolidated financial statements of the Predecessor.\nStockholder Approval of Stock Splits Transaction and Delisting of our Common Stock from the New York Stock Exchange\nOn January 9, 2020, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the Special Meeting\u201d). At the Special Meeting, the holders of a majority of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote approved amendments to the Company's certificate of incorporation, as amended (the Certificate of Incorporation\u201d), to effect a reverse stock split of the Company's common stock (the Reverse Stock Split\u201d), followed immediately by a forward stock split of the Company's common stock (the Forward Stock Split,\u201d and together with the Reverse Stock Split, the Stock Splits\u201d), at a ratio (i) not less than 1-for-5 and not greater than 1-for-100, in the case of the Reverse Stock Split, and (ii) not less than 5-for-1 and not greater than 100-for-1, in the case of the Forward Stock Split. If the Stock Splits are effectuated, then as a result of the Stock Splits, a stockholder owning immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split fewer than a minimum number of shares, which, depending on the stock split ratios chosen by the Board, would be between 5 and 100, would be paid $30.00, without interest, for each share of common stock held by such holder immediately prior to the effective time. Cashed out stockholders would no longer be stockholders of the Company. On January 29, 2019, in connection with the anticipated Stock Splits, the Company filed a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) to voluntarily delist its common stock from trading on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE\u201d) and to deregister its common stock under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d). The delisting occurred ten calendar days after the filing of the Form 25 so that trading was suspended on February 10, 2020, prior to the market opening. Following the delisting, the Company's Board has continued to evaluate updated\nownership data to ascertain the aggregate costs within the ranges of stock split ratios that the Company's stockholders approved at the Special Meeting. Based upon this analysis, the Board will continue to consider the appropriate ratio to effectuate the Stock Splits. As previously disclosed, the Board, at its sole discretion, may elect to abandon the Stock Splits and the overall deregistration process for any reason, including if it determines that effectuating the Stock Splits would be too costly. Assuming the Board determines to proceed with the Stock Splits and the overall deregistration process, the Company will file with the State of Delaware certificates of amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to effectuate the Stock Splits. Following the effectiveness of the Stock Splits, the Company will file a Form 15 with the SEC certifying that it has less than 300 stockholders, which will terminate the registration of the Company's common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. As a result, the Company would cease to file annual, quarterly, current, and other reports and documents with the SEC, and stockholders will cease to receive annual reports and proxy statements. Even if the Company effectuates the Stock Splits and terminates its registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, the Company intends to continue to prepare audited annual and unaudited quarterly financial statements and to make such information available to its stockholders on a voluntary basis. However, the Company would not be required to do so by law and there is no assurance that even if the Company did make such information available that it would continue to do so in the future.\nFinancial Results\nRevenues were $472.4 million and $157.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and $480.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating gross margin was $56.7 million and $11.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and a loss of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOutlook\nFor 2020, we expect the U.S. land rig count to be relatively flat to year end levels after a 26% decline during 2019 while the U.S. offshore rig count is expected to increase approximately 10%. The net impact should translate into a decrease in our year over year U.S. rental tools business results and a small increase in our barge rig utilization, although overall results for our U.S. (lower 48) drilling segment should decrease due to a shift from rig activation to lower margin plug and abandonment activity on our California O&M.\nWe expect the international rig count to increase approximately 3% in 2020 with improvement mainly coming from Mexico, the UAE, Iraq, and Egypt. The areas in which the anticipated increase will occur should bode well for Parker. Our International rental tools segment revenue is anticipated to increase as we continue to win projects utilizing our well construction, well intervention, and surface and tubular goods in the Middle East, the UK, and Latin America. Our International and Alaska drilling segment results are expected to increase as we have won numerous contracts recently, including a 5-year extension of our Sakhalin Island contract and the addition of two O&M contracts in Alaska. In total, the backlog for our O&M contracts has grown to $627 million.\nOur expectations for 2020 results are directly linked to anticipated worldwide rig activity. Thus, there are inherent risks involved, including changes to the current supply and demand outlook, the impact of the coronavirus, and investor pressure on E&P companies to exercise capital discipline and to generate free cash flow. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors for further information regarding the risks facing the Company.\nResults of Operations\nOur business is comprised of two business lines: (1) rental tools services and (2) drilling services. We report our rental tools services business as two reportable segments: (1) U.S. rental tools and (2) International rental tools. We report our drilling services business as two reportable segments: (1) U.S. (lower 48) drilling and (2) International & Alaska drilling. We eliminate inter-segment revenues and expenses.\nWe analyze financial results for each of our reportable segments. The reportable segments presented are consistent with our reportable segments discussed in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 17 - Reportable Segments in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion. We monitor our reporting segments based on several criteria, including operating gross margin and operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization. Operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization is computed as revenues less direct operating expenses, and excludes depreciation and amortization expense, where applicable. Operating gross margin percentages are computed as operating gross margin as a percent of revenues. The operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization amounts and percentages should not be used as a substitute for those amounts reported under accounting policies generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), but should be viewed in addition to the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes this information provides valuable insight into the information management considers important in managing the business.\nNine Months Ended December 31, 2019, Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 and the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nRevenues were $472.4 million and $157.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and $480.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating gross margin was $56.7 million and $11.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and a loss of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe following is an analysis of our operating results for the comparable periods by reportable segment:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

We recognized income tax expense due to the jurisdictional mix of income and loss during the period, along with our continued inability to recognize the benefits associated with certain losses as a result of valuation allowances, changes in uncertain tax positions, and the income tax impacts of adjustments made as part of Fresh Start Accounting.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements, capital needs and availability of resources in view of expansion plans, operational and other cash needs. To meet our short-term liquidity requirements we primarily rely on our cash on hand and cash from operations. We also have access to cash through the Credit Facility. We expect that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to provide us the ability to fund our current operations and required capital expenditures. We may need to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt principal payments, or pursuits of business opportunities that support our strategy, through additional borrowings or the issuance of additional Successor Common Stock or other forms of equity. Our credit agreements limit our ability to pay dividends.

While the overall market for oilfield services remains challenging, we are beginning to see a market recovery that is expected to increase our earnings, working capital and capital spending as we pursue attractive investment opportunities.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows from investing activities were a use of cash of $70.3 million and $9.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash flows used in investing activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, included capital expenditures of $71.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively, and $70.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which were primarily used for tubular and other products for our rental tools services business and rig-related maintenance.\nCapital expenditures for 2020 are estimated to range from $85.0 million and $95.0 million and will primarily be directed to our rental tools services business inventory and maintenance capital for our drilling services business. Future capital spending will be evaluated based upon adequate return requirements and available liquidity.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities were a use of $35.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, primarily related to the $35.2 million prepayment of the Term Loan (as defined below). Cash flows from financing activities were a source of cash of $84.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily related to proceeds from the rights offering of $95.0 million, partially offset by the payment of amounts borrowed under debtor in possession financing of $10.0 million. Cash flows from financing activities were a source of cash of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to amounts borrowed against the DIP Facility of $10.0 million and payments of $3.6 million, $1.4 million and $1.0 million for dividends on the Predecessor's Preferred Stock, debt issuance cost related to the Fifth Amendment to the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement and debtors-in-possession financing costs respectively.\nDebt Summary\nAs of December 31, 2019, our principal amount of debt was related to the $177.9 million Term Loan, due 2024.\nSuccessor Credit Facility\nOn March 26, 2019, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, we and certain of our subsidiaries, entered into a credit agreement with the lenders party thereto (the Credit Facility Lenders\u201d), Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and Bank of America, N.A. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, providing for a revolving credit facility (as amended and restated by the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as defined below), the Credit Facility\u201d) with initial aggregate commitments in the amount of $50.0 million, guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. Availability under the Credit Facility is subject to a monthly borrowing base calculation and, prior to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, was based on eligible domestic rental equipment and eligible domestic accounts receivable. The Credit Facility provides for a $30.0 million sublimit of the aggregate commitments that is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Prior to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Credit Facility required us to maintain minimum liquidity of $25.0 million, defined as cash in our liquidity account not to exceed $10.0 million and availability under the borrowing base, allowed for an increase to the aggregate commitments by up to an additional $75.0 million, subject to certain conditions, matured on March 26, 2023, and bore interest either at a rate equal to:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>LIBOR plus an applicable margin that varies from 2.25 percent to 2.75 percent per annum or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a base rate plus an applicable margin that varies from 1.25 percent to 1.75 percent per annum.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Prior to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we were required to pay a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum on the actual daily unused portion of the current aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility. We are required to pay customary letter of credit and fronting fees under the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, as to compliance with laws (including environmental laws and anti-corruption laws), delivery of quarterly and annual consolidated financial statements and monthly borrowing base certificates, conduct of business, maintenance of property, maintenance of insurance, restrictions on the incurrence of liens, indebtedness, asset dispositions, fundamental changes, restricted payments, and other customary covenants. Additionally, the Credit Facility contains customary events of default and remedies for credit\nfacilities of this nature. If we do not comply with the financial and other covenants in the Credit Facility, the Credit Facility Lenders may, subject to customary cure rights, require immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility, and any outstanding unfunded commitments may be terminated. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all the financial covenants under the Credit Facility.\nOn October 8, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d), which amended and restated the Credit Facility. As a result of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement:\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>the Credit Facility matures on October 8, 2024, subject to certain restrictions, including the refinancing of the Company's Term Loan Agreement (as defined below),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>our annual borrowing costs under the Credit Facility are lowered by reducing\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the interest rate to (a) LIBOR plus a range of 1.75 percent to 2.25 percent (based on availability) or (b) a base rate plus a range of 0.75 percent to 1.25 percent (based on availability), and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the unused commitment fee to a range of 0.25 percent to 0.375 percent (based on utilization),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>a $25 million liquidity covenant was replaced with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirement of 1.0x when excess availability is less than the greater of\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>20.0 percent of the lesser of commitments and the borrowing base and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$10.0 million,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(4)\n</td> <td>an additional borrower was allowed to be included in the borrowing base upon completion of a field examination,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(5)\n</td> <td>the calculation of the borrowing base was revised by, among other things, excluding eligible domestic rental equipment and including 90 percent of investment grade eligible domestic accounts receivable,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(6)\n</td> <td>the Company was allowed to grant a second priority lien on non-working capital assets in the event of a refinancing of the Term Loan Agreement,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(7)\n</td> <td>the amount allowed for an increase to the aggregate commitments was reduced from $75.0 million to $50.0 million, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(8)\n</td> <td>we were permitted to make a voluntary prepayment of $35.0 million on our Term Loan on September 20, 2019 without such prepayment being included in the calculation of our fixed charge coverage ratio.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> As of December 31, 2019, the borrowing base availability under the Credit Facility was $40.2 million, which was further reduced by $9.3 million in supporting letters of credit outstanding, resulting in availability under the Credit Facility of $30.9 million. As of December 31, 2019, debt issuance costs of $1.5 million ($1.3 million, net of amortization) are being amortized over the term of the Credit Facility on a straight-line basis.\nSuccessor Term Loan, Due March 2024\nOn March 26, 2019, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a second lien term loan credit agreement (the Term Loan Agreement\u201d) with the lenders party thereto (the Term Loan Lenders\u201d) and UMB Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, providing for term loans (the Term Loan\u201d) in the amount of $210.0 million, guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. The Term Loan matures on March 26, 2024.\nThe Term Loan bears interest at a rate of 13.0 percent per annum, payable quarterly on the first day of each January, April, July, and October, beginning July 1, 2019, with 11.0 percent paid in cash and 2.0 percent paid in kind and capitalized by adding such amount to the outstanding principal.\nWe may voluntarily prepay all or a part of the Term Loan and, under certain conditions we are required to prepay all or a part of the Term Loan, in each case, at a premium (1) on or prior to 6 months after the closing date of 0 percent; (2) from 6 months and on or prior to two years after the closing date of 6.50 percent; (3) from two years and on or prior to three years after the closing date of 3.25 percent; and (4) from three years after the closing date and thereafter of 0 percent.\nOn September 20, 2019, we made a voluntary prepayment on the Term Loan of $35.0 million in principal, plus $1.0 million in interest associated with the principal payment. Since the prepayment occurred within the first six months from the closing date, no premium was applicable on the prepayment. As of December 31, 2019, the Term Loan balance was $177.9 million.\nThe Term Loan is subject to mandatory prepayments and customary reinvestment rights. The mandatory prepayments include prepayment requirements with respect to a change of control, asset sales and debt issuances, in each case subject to certain exceptions or conditions. The Term Loan Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including as to compliance with laws (including environmental laws and anti-corruption laws), delivery of quarterly and annual financial statements, conduct of business, maintenance of property, maintenance of insurance, restrictions on the incurrence of liens, indebtedness, asset dispositions, fundamental changes, restricted payments and other customary covenants. Additionally, the Term Loan Agreement contains customary events of default and remedies for facilities of this nature. If we do not comply with the covenants in the Term Loan Agreement, the Term Loan Lenders may, subject to customary cure rights, require immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all the financial covenants under the Term Loan Agreement.\nPredecessor 6.75% Senior Notes, Due July 2022\nOn January 22, 2014, we issued $360.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.75% Notes pursuant to the 6.75% Notes Indenture. The 6.75% Notes were general unsecured obligations of the Company and ranked equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 6.75% Notes were jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that guaranteed indebtedness under the Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement, as amended from time-to-time ( 2015 Secured Credit Agreement\u201d) and our 7.50% Notes. Interest on the 6.75% Notes was payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning July 15, 2014. Debt issuance costs related to the 6.75% Notes were approximately $7.6 million. After the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the carrying amount of debt was adjusted to the claim amount and all unamortized debt issuance costs prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases were fully expensed.\nPredecessor 7.50% Senior Notes, Due August 2020\nOn July 30, 2013, we issued $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes pursuant to the 7.50% Notes Indenture. The 7.50% Notes were general unsecured obligations of the Company and ranked equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 7.50% Notes were jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that guaranteed indebtedness under the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement and the 6.75% Notes. Interest on the 7.50% Notes was payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning February 1, 2014. Debt issuance costs related to the 7.50% Notes were approximately $5.6 million. After the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the carrying amount of debt was adjusted to the claim amount and all unamortized debt issuance costs prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases were fully expensed.\nThe commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default that accelerated the Company's obligations under the indentures governing the 6.75% Notes and the 7.50% Notes. However, any efforts to enforce such payment obligations were automatically stayed under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The principal balance on the 6.75% Notes and 7.50% Notes of $360.0 million and $225.0 million, respectively, had been reclassed from long-term debt to liabilities subject to compromise as of December 31, 2018. See also Note 2 - Chapter 11 Emergence for further details.\nAs previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 26, 2019, our obligations with respect to the Senior Notes as well as our subsidiaries' obligations under their respective guarantees under the 6.75% Notes Indenture and the 7.50% Notes Indenture (and the Senior Notes) were cancelled and extinguished as provided in the Plan. From and after March 26, 2019, neither the Company nor its subsidiaries have any continuing obligations under the 6.75% Notes Indenture and 7.50% Notes Indenture or with respect to the Senior Notes or the guarantees related thereto except to the extent specifically provided in the Plan.\nPredecessor 2015 Secured Credit Agreement\nOn January 26, 2015, we entered into the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement. The 2015 Secured Credit Agreement was originally comprised of a $200.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolver\u201d). The 2015 Secured Credit Agreement formerly included financial maintenance covenants, including a leverage ratio, consolidated interest coverage ratio, senior secured leverage ratio, and asset coverage ratio, many of which were suspended beginning in September 2015.\nWe executed various amendments which, among other things: (1) modified the credit facility to an asset-based lending structure, (2) reduced the size of the Revolver to $80.0 million, (3) eliminated the financial maintenance covenants previously in effect and replaced them with a minimum liquidity covenant of $30.0 million and a monthly borrowing base calculation, (4) allowed for the refinancing of our existing Senior Notes with either secured or unsecured debt, (5) added the ability for the Company to designate certain of its subsidiaries as Designated Borrowers\u201d, and (6) permitted the Company to make restricted payments in the form of certain equity interests.\nOn October 25, 2018, we entered into a Consent Agreement and a Cash Collateral Agreement, whereby we could open bank accounts not subject to the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement for the purpose of depositing cash to secure certain letters of credit. On October 30, 2018, we deposited $10.0 million into a cash collateral account to support the letters of credit outstanding, which is included in the restricted cash balance on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.\nOur obligations under the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement were guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, other than immaterial subsidiaries and subsidiaries generating revenues primarily outside the United States, each of which has executed guaranty agreements, and were secured by first priority liens on our accounts receivable, specified rigs including barge rigs in the Gulf of Mexico ( GOM\u201d) and land rigs in Alaska, certain U.S.-based rental equipment of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors and the equity interests of certain of the Company's subsidiaries. In addition to the liquidity covenant and borrowing base requirements, the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, such as limitations on indebtedness and liens, and restrictions on entry into certain affiliate transactions and payments (including certain payments of dividends).\nAll of the Company's obligations under the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement were paid prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, and the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement, including the Revolver thereunder, was terminated concurrently with the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. See also Note 2 - Chapter 11 Emergence for further details. Unamortized debt issuance costs were fully expensed upon termination of the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement.\nOther Matters\nBusiness Risks\nSee Item 1A. Risk Factors, for a discussion of risks related to our business.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to fair value of assets, bad debt, materials and supplies obsolescence, property and equipment, income taxes, workers' compensation and health insurance and contingent liabilities for which settlement is deemed to be probable. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. While we believe that such estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they can be complex and require significant judgments, assumptions and/or estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Other significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the consolidated financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements\nFor purposes of recording fair value adjustments for certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities, and determining fair value disclosures, we estimate fair value at a price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market for the asset or liability. Our valuation technique requires inputs that we categorize using a three-level hierarchy, from highest to lowest level of observable inputs, as follows: (1) unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1), (2) direct or indirect observable inputs, including quoted prices or other market data, for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or identical assets or liabilities in less active markets (Level 2) and (3) unobservable inputs that require significant judgment for which there is little or no market data (Level 3). When multiple input levels are required for a valuation, we categorize the entire fair value measurement according to the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement even though we may have also utilized significant inputs that are more readily observable.\nImpairment of Property, Plant, and Equipment\nWe evaluate the carrying amounts of long-lived assets for potential impairment when events occur or circumstances change that indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. For example, evaluations are performed when we experience sustained significant declines in utilization and dayrates, and we do not contemplate recovery in the near future. In addition, we evaluate our assets when we reclassify property and equipment to assets held for sale or as discontinued operations as prescribed by accounting guidance related to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. We determine recoverability by evaluating the undiscounted estimated future net cash flows. When impairment is indicated, we measure the impairment as the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value. Management considers a number of factors such as estimated future cash flows, appraisals and current market value analysis in determining fair value. Assets are written down to fair value if the concluded current fair value is below the net carrying value.\nAsset impairment evaluations are, by nature, highly subjective. They involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets and reflect management's assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels, dayrates and costs. The use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets.\nIntangible Assets\nOur intangible assets are related to customer relationships, trade names and developed technology, and are amortized over a period of approximately three, five and six years, respectively. We assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indicators of impairment are present based on expected future profitability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to our overall operations. Should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the intangible assets would be recognized as an impairment loss.\nAccrual for Self-Insurance\nSubstantially all of our operations are subject to hazards that are customary for oil and natural gas drilling operations, including blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, lost or stuck drill strings, equipment defects, cratering, oil and natural gas well fires and explosions, natural disasters, pollution, mechanical failure and damage or loss during transportation. Some of our fleet is also subject to hazards inherent in marine operations, either while on-site or during mobilization, such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision, damage from severe weather and marine life infestations. These hazards could result in damage to or destruction of drilling equipment, personal injury and property damage, suspension of operations or environmental damage, which could lead to claims by third parties or customers, suspension of operations and contract terminations. We have had accidents in the past due to some of these hazards.\nOur contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification between ourselves and our customers, including with respect to well control and subsurface risks. We seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks. We also maintain insurance for personal injuries, damage to or loss of equipment and other insurance coverage for various business risks. To the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements, we seek protection through insurance. However, these insurance or indemnification agreements may not adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible.\nBased on the risks discussed above, we estimate our liability in excess of insurance coverage and accrue for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Accruals related to insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the insurance claims and our past experience with similar claims. The actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from the amounts estimated. We accrue actuarially determined amounts in our consolidated balance sheet to cover self-insurance retentions for workers' compensation, employers' liability, general liability, automobile liability and health benefits claims. These accruals use historical data based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims to project future losses. These estimates and accruals have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount paid on claims.\nAs the determination of our liability for insurance claims could be material and is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts, management believes that accounting estimates related to insurance accruals are critical.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe are a U.S. company and we operate through our various foreign legal entities and their branches and subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world. Consequently, our tax provision is based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income is earned. The income tax rates imposed and methods of computing taxable income in these jurisdictions vary. Therefore, as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes. Our effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions. Current income tax expense represents either liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year, nonresident withholding taxes or changes in prior year tax estimates which may result from tax audit adjustments. Our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on the consolidated balance sheet. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In order to determine the amount of deferred tax assets or liabilities, as well as the valuation allowances, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding amounts and sources of future taxable income, where rigs will be deployed and other matters. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, as well as changes in tax laws, could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets and liabilities or valuation allowances, including as discussed below.\nOur ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets requires that we achieve certain future earnings levels prior to expiration. Evaluations of the realizability of deferred tax assets are, by nature, highly subjective. They involve expectations about future operations and reflect management's assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels, dayrates and costs. The use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different determinations of our ability to realize deferred tax assets. In the event that our earnings performance projections do not indicate that we will be able to benefit from our deferred tax assets, valuation allowances are established following the more likely than not\u201d criteria. We periodically evaluate our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and, in accordance with accounting guidance related to accounting for income taxes, will record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense in the period for which an existing estimate changes.\nWe do not currently provide for deferred taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as such earnings were reinvested to fund our international operations. If the unremitted earnings were to be distributed, we could be subject to taxes and\nforeign withholding taxes though it is not practicable to determine the resulting liability, if any, that would result on the distribution of such earnings. We annually review our position and may elect to change our future tax position.\nWe apply the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes. This accounting guidance requires that management make estimates and assumptions affecting amounts recorded as liabilities and related disclosures due to the uncertainty as to final resolution of certain tax matters. Because the recognition of liabilities under this interpretation may require periodic adjustments and may not necessarily imply any change in management's assessment of the ultimate outcome of these items, the amount recorded may not accurately reflect actual outcomes.\nRevenue Recognition\nContract drilling revenues and expenses, comprised of daywork drilling contracts, call-outs against master service agreements and engineering and related project service contracts, are recognized as services are performed and collection is reasonably assured. For certain contracts, we receive payments contractually designated for the mobilization of rigs and other drilling equipment. Mobilization payments received, and direct costs incurred for the mobilization, are deferred and recognized over the term of the related drilling contract; however, costs incurred to relocate rigs and other drilling equipment to areas in which a contract has not been secured are expensed as incurred. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as both revenues and direct costs. For contracts that are terminated prior to the specified term, early termination payments received by us are recognized as revenues when all contractual requirements are met. Revenues from rental activities are recognized ratably over the rental term which is generally less than six months. Our project related services contracts include engineering, consulting, and project management scopes of work and revenue is typically recognized on a time and materials basis.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated for losses that may occur resulting from disputed amounts and the inability of our customers to pay amounts owed. We estimate the allowance based on historical write-off experience and information about specific customers. We review individually, for collectability, all balances over 90 days past due as well as balances due from any customer with respect to which we have information leading us to believe that a risk exists for potential collection.\nLegal and Investigative Matters\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have accrued an estimate of the probable and estimable costs for the resolution of certain legal and investigation matters. We have not accrued any amounts for other matters for which the liability is not probable and reasonably estimable. Generally, the estimate of probable costs related to these matters is developed in consultation with our legal advisors. The estimates take into consideration factors such as the complexity of the issues, litigation risks and settlement costs. If the actual settlement costs, final judgments, or fines, after appeals, differ from our estimates, our future financial results may be adversely affected.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of the new accounting pronouncements that have had or are expected to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 19 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.", "item_7_truncated": " (5) the calculation of the borrowing base was revised by, among other things, excluding eligible domestic rental equipment and including 90 percent of investment grade eligible domestic accounts receivable, \nThe Credit Facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, as to compliance with laws (including environmental laws and anti-corruption laws), delivery of quarterly and annual consolidated financial statements and monthly borrowing base certificates, conduct of business, maintenance of property, maintenance of insurance, restrictions on the incurrence of liens, indebtedness, asset dispositions, fundamental changes, restricted payments, and other customary covenants.

matters. We have not accrued any amounts for other matters for which the liability is not probable and reasonably estimable. Generally, the estimate of probable costs related to these matters is developed in consultation with our legal advisors. The estimates take into consideration factors such as the complexity of the issues, litigation risks and settlement costs. If the actual settlement costs, final judgments, or fines, after appeals, differ from our estimates, our future financial results may be adversely affected.\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in thousands\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Availability under Credit Facility (2)\n</td> <td>30,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liquidity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor purposes of recording fair value adjustments for certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities, and determining fair value disclosures, we estimate fair value at a price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market for the asset or liability. Our valuation technique requires inputs that we categorize using a three-level hierarchy, from highest to lowest level of observable inputs, as follows: (1) unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1), (2) direct or indirect observable inputs, including quoted prices or other market data, for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or identical assets or liabilities in less active markets (Level 2) and (3) unobservable inputs that require significant judgment for which there is little or no market data (Level 3). When multiple input levels are required for a valuation, we categorize the entire fair value measurement according to the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement even though we may have also utilized significant inputs that are more readily observable.\nThe Term Loan is subject to mandatory prepayments and customary reinvestment rights. The mandatory prepayments include prepayment requirements with respect to a change of control, asset sales and debt issuances, in each case subject to certain exceptions or conditions. The Term Loan Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including as to compliance with laws (including environmental laws and anti-corruption laws), delivery of quarterly and annual financial statements, conduct of business, maintenance of property, maintenance of insurance, restrictions on the incurrence of liens, indebtedness, asset dispositions, fundamental changes, restricted payments and other customary covenants. Additionally, the Term Loan Agreement contains customary events of default and remedies for facilities of this nature. If we do not comply with the covenants in the Term Loan Agreement, the Term Loan Lenders may, subject to customary cure rights, require immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all the financial covenants under the Term Loan Agreement.\nOn December 12, 2018, prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors entered into a restructuring support agreement (as amended on January 28, 2019, the RSA\u201d) with certain significant holders of (1) 7.50% Senior Notes, due 2020 (the 7.50% Note Holders\u201d) issued pursuant to the indenture (the 7.50% Notes Indenture\u201d) dated July 30, 2013 (the 7.50% Notes\u201d), by and among Parker Drilling, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the Trustee\u201d), (2) 6.75% Senior Notes, due 2022 (the 6.75% Note Holders\u201d) issued pursuant to the indenture (the 6.75% Notes Indenture\u201d) dated January 22, 2014 (the 6.75% Notes\u201d and together with the 7.50% Notes, the Senior Notes\u201d), by and among Parker Drilling, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and the Trustee, (3) Parker Drilling's existing common stock (the Predecessor Common Stock\u201d) and (4) Parker Drilling's 7.25% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (the Predecessor Preferred Stock\u201d and such holders to support a restructuring (the Restructuring\u201d) on the terms set forth in the Plan.\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Nine Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. (lower 48) drilling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rigs available for service (1)\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utilization rate of rigs available for service (2)\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International & Alaska drilling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eastern Hemisphere\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rigs available for service (1)\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utilization rate of rigs available for service (2)\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Latin America Region\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rigs available for service (1)\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utilization rate of rigs available for service (2)\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alaska\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rigs available for service (1)\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utilization rate of rigs available for service (2)\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total International & Alaska drilling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rigs available for service (1)\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utilization rate of rigs available for service (2)\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll of the Company's obligations under the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement were paid prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, and the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement, including the Revolver thereunder, was terminated concurrently with the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases.

At the Special Meeting, the holders of a majority of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote approved amendments to the Company's certificate of incorporation, as amended (the Certificate of Incorporation\u201d), to effect a reverse stock split of the Company's common stock (the Reverse Stock Split\u201d), followed immediately by a forward stock split of the Company's common stock (the Forward Stock Split,\u201d and together with the Reverse Stock Split, the Stock Splits\u201d), at a ratio (i) not less than 1-for-5 and not greater than 1-for-100, in the case of the Reverse Stock Split, and (ii) not less than 5-for-1 and not greater than 100-for-1, in the case of the Forward Stock Split. If the Stock Splits are effectuated, then as a result of the Stock Splits, a stockholder owning immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split fewer than a minimum number of shares, which, depending on the stock split ratios chosen by the Board, would be between 5 and 100, would be paid $30.00, without interest, for each share of common stock held by such holder immediately prior to the effective time. Cashed out stockholders would no longer be stockholders of the Company. On January 29, 2019, in connection with the anticipated Stock Splits, the Company filed a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) to voluntarily delist its common stock from trading on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE\u201d) and to deregister its common stock under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d). The delisting occurred ten calendar days after the filing of the Form 25 so that trading was suspended on February 10, 2020, prior to the market opening. Following the delisting, the Company's Board has continued to evaluate updated\nRevenues were $472.4 million and $157.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and $480.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating gross margin was $56.7 million and $11.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and a loss of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe expect the international rig count to increase approximately 3% in 2020 with improvement mainly coming from Mexico, the UAE, Iraq, and Egypt. The areas in which the anticipated increase will occur should bode well for Parker. Our International rental tools segment revenue is anticipated to increase as we continue to win projects utilizing our well construction, well intervention, and surface and tubular goods in the Middle East, the UK, and Latin America. Our International and Alaska drilling segment results are expected to increase as we have won numerous contracts recently, including a 5-year extension of our Sakhalin Island contract and the addition of two O&M contracts in Alaska. In total, the backlog for our O&M contracts has grown to $627 million.\nLoss on Impairment\nManagement's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We use rounded numbers in the Management Discussion and Analysis section which may result in slight differences with results reported under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nU.S. rental tools segment revenues were $144.7 million and $52.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and were $176.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, were primarily driven by customer activity in U.S. land and offshore rentals.\nNine Months Ended December 31, 2019, Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 and the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nSuccessor Term Loan, Due March 2024\nforeign withholding taxes though it is not practicable to determine the resulting liability, if any, that would result on the distribution of such earnings. We annually review our position and may elect to change our future tax position.\nInternational rental tools segment revenues were $71.3 million and $21.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and was $79.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, were primarily driven by well construction, well intervention services, and surface and tubular services.\n (2) our annual borrowing costs under the Credit Facility are lowered by reducing \n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly cyclical. Activity levels are driven by traditional energy industry activity indicators, which include current and expected commodity prices, drilling rig counts, footage drilled, well counts, and our customers' spending levels allocated to exploratory and development drilling.\n \u2022 a base rate plus an applicable margin that varies from 1.25 percent to 1.75 percent per annum.  Prior to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we were required to pay a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum on the actual daily unused portion of the current aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility. We are required to pay customary letter of credit and fronting fees under the Credit Facility.\nOther Financial Data\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated for losses that may occur resulting from disputed amounts and the inability of our customers to pay amounts owed. We estimate the allowance based on historical write-off experience and information about specific customers. We review individually, for collectability, all balances over 90 days past due as well as balances due from any customer with respect to which we have information leading us to believe that a risk exists for potential collection.\n \u2022 90,558 shares of Successor Common Stock and 1,032,073 Successor warrants to purchase 1,032,073 shares of Successor Common Stock pro rata to holders of the Predecessor Preferred Stock; \nLiquidity\nHistorical market indicators are listed below:\nAs of December 31, 2019, our principal amount of debt was related to the $177.9 million Term Loan, due 2024.\nThe following table provides a summary of our total liquidity:\nFinancial Results\n(2) Excludes Canadian rig count.\n \u2022 1,403,910 shares of Successor Common Stock to the commitment parties under the Backstop Commitment Agreement in connection with their backstop obligation thereunder to purchase unsubscribed shares of Successor Common Stock; and \nWe evaluate the carrying amounts of long-lived assets for potential impairment when events occur or circumstances change that indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. For example, evaluations are performed when we experience sustained significant declines in utilization and dayrates, and we do not contemplate recovery in the near future. In addition, we evaluate our assets when we reclassify property and equipment to assets held for sale or as discontinued operations as prescribed by accounting guidance related to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. We determine recoverability by evaluating the undiscounted estimated future net cash flows. When impairment is indicated, we measure the impairment as the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value. Management considers a number of factors such as estimated future cash flows, appraisals and current market value analysis in determining fair value. Assets are written down to fair value if the concluded current fair value is below the net carrying value.\nPre-petition Restructuring Charges\nOutlook\nGain (loss) on disposition of assets, net was a gain of $0.2 million and a gain of $0.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and a loss of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We periodically sell equipment deemed to be excess, obsolete, or not currently required for operations.\nThe following is an analysis of our operating results for the comparable periods by reportable segment:\n (4) an additional borrower was allowed to be included in the borrowing base upon completion of a field examination, \n (1) The number of rigs available for service is determined by calculating the number of days each rig was in our fleet and was under contract or available for contract. For example, a rig under contract or available for contract for six months of a year is 0.5 rigs available for service during such year. Our method of computation of rigs available for service may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. \n (1) As of December 31, 2019, approximately $51.9 million of the $105.0 million of cash and equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. \n \u2022 LIBOR plus an applicable margin that varies from 2.25 percent to 2.75 percent per annum or \nAs previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 26, 2019, our obligations with respect to the Senior Notes as well as our subsidiaries' obligations under their respective guarantees under the 6.75% Notes Indenture and the 7.50% Notes Indenture (and the Senior Notes) were cancelled and extinguished as provided in the Plan. From and after March 26, 2019, neither the Company nor its subsidiaries have any continuing obligations under the 6.75% Notes Indenture and 7.50% Notes Indenture or with respect to the Senior Notes or the guarantees related thereto except to the extent specifically provided in the Plan.\nUpon emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting ( Fresh Start Accounting\u201d) in accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 852, Reorganizations ( Topic 852\u201d), which resulted in the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. See Note 2 - Chapter 11 Emergence and Note 3 - Fresh Start Accounting for further details. We evaluated the events between March 26, 2019 and March 31, 2019 and concluded that the use of an accounting convenience date of March 31, 2019, (the Fresh Start Reporting Date\u201d) would not have a material impact on our results of operations or balance sheet. As such, the application of fresh start accounting was reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019, and fresh start accounting adjustments related thereto were included in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019.\nSubstantially all of our operations are subject to hazards that are customary for oil and natural gas drilling operations, including blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, lost or stuck drill strings, equipment defects, cratering, oil and natural gas well fires and explosions, natural disasters, pollution, mechanical failure and damage or loss during transportation. Some of our fleet is also subject to hazards inherent in marine operations, either while on-site or during mobilization, such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision, damage from severe weather and marine life infestations. These hazards could result in damage to or destruction of drilling equipment, personal injury and property damage, suspension of operations or environmental damage, which could lead to claims by third parties or customers, suspension of operations and contract terminations. We have had accidents in the past due to some of these hazards.\nOther income and expense was an expense of $0.2 million and nominal for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and an expense of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Activity in all periods primarily included the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nU.S. (lower 48) drilling segment operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization was a gain of $6.6 million and a loss of $0.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and a loss of $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, were primarily driven by revenues discussed above.\nOur ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets requires that we achieve certain future earnings levels prior to expiration. Evaluations of the realizability of deferred tax assets are, by nature, highly subjective. They involve expectations about future operations and reflect management's assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels, dayrates and costs. The use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different determinations of our ability to realize deferred tax assets. In the event that our earnings performance projections do not indicate that we will be able to benefit from our deferred tax assets, valuation allowances are established following the more likely than not\u201d criteria. We periodically evaluate our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and, in accordance with accounting guidance related to accounting for income taxes, will record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense in the period for which an existing estimate changes.\nGain (Loss) on Disposition of Assets, Net\nAs the determination of our liability for insurance claims could be material and is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts, management believes that accounting estimates related to insurance accruals are critical.\nStockholder Approval of Stock Splits Transaction and Delisting of our Common Stock from the New York Stock Exchange\nU.S. (lower 48) drilling segment revenues were $36.7 million and $6.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and was $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, were primarily driven by our inland barge rig fleet and O&M revenue.\nCash flows from operating activities were a source of cash of $61.6 million and $14.9 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and a use of cash of $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash flows from operating activities in each period were largely impacted by our operating results and changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were a use of cash of $20.7 million and a source of cash of $17.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and a use of cash of $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n(3) Average daily commodity prices for the periods indicated based on NYMEX front-month composite energy prices.\n \u2022 the unused commitment fee to a range of 0.25 percent to 0.375 percent (based on utilization), \nInternational & Alaska drilling segment operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization was $32.0 million and $7.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and was $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, were primarily driven by revenues discussed above.\nOn January 26, 2015, we entered into the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement. The 2015 Secured Credit Agreement was originally comprised of a $200.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolver\u201d). The 2015 Secured Credit Agreement formerly included financial maintenance covenants, including a leverage ratio, consolidated interest coverage ratio, senior secured leverage ratio, and asset coverage ratio, many of which were suspended beginning in September 2015.\nOn October 8, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d), which amended and restated the Credit Facility. As a result of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement:\nFor discussion related to the results of operations and change in financial condition of our Predecessor for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 11, 2019.\n \u2022 20.0 percent of the lesser of commitments and the borrowing base and \nOn January 22, 2014, we issued $360.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.75% Notes pursuant to the 6.75% Notes Indenture. The 6.75% Notes were general unsecured obligations of the Company and ranked equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 6.75% Notes were jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that guaranteed indebtedness under the Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement, as amended from time-to-time ( 2015 Secured Credit Agreement\u201d) and our 7.50% Notes. Interest on the 6.75% Notes was payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning July 15, 2014. Debt issuance costs related to the 6.75% Notes were approximately $7.6 million. After the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the carrying amount of debt was adjusted to the claim amount and all unamortized debt issuance costs prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases were fully expensed.\nCash flows from financing activities were a use of $35.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, primarily related to the $35.2 million prepayment of the Term Loan (as defined below). Cash flows from financing activities were a source of cash of $84.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily related to proceeds from the rights offering of $95.0 million, partially offset by the payment of amounts borrowed under debtor in possession financing of $10.0 million. Cash flows from financing activities were a source of cash of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to amounts borrowed against the DIP Facility of $10.0 million and payments of $3.6 million, $1.4 million and $1.0 million for dividends on the Predecessor's Preferred Stock, debt issuance cost related to the Fifth Amendment to the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement and debtors-in-possession financing costs respectively.\nU.S. (Lower 48) Drilling\nFor 2020, we expect the U.S. land rig count to be relatively flat to year end levels after a 26% decline during 2019 while the U.S. offshore rig count is expected to increase approximately 10%. The net impact should translate into a decrease in our year over year U.S. rental tools business results and a small increase in our barge rig utilization, although overall results for our U.S. (lower 48) drilling segment should decrease due to a shift from rig activation to lower margin plug and abandonment activity on our California O&M.\nThere were no pre-petition charges for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 or the three months ended March 31, 2019. Pre-petition charges were $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily consisting of professional fees related to the Chapter 11 Cases.\nFinancing Activities\nWe may voluntarily prepay all or a part of the Term Loan and, under certain conditions we are required to prepay all or a part of the Term Loan, in each case, at a premium (1) on or prior to 6 months after the closing date of 0 percent; (2) from 6 months and on or prior to two years after the closing date of 6.50 percent; (3) from two years and on or prior to three years after the closing date of 3.25 percent; and (4) from three years after the closing date and thereafter of 0 percent.\nWe do not currently provide for deferred taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as such earnings were reinvested to fund our international operations. If the unremitted earnings were to be distributed, we could be subject to taxes and\nOur intangible assets are related to customer relationships, trade names and developed technology, and are amortized over a period of approximately three, five and six years, respectively. We assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indicators of impairment are present based on expected future profitability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to our overall operations. Should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the intangible assets would be recognized as an impairment loss.\n (2) As of December 31, 2019, the borrowing base availability under the Credit Facility was $40.2 million, which was further reduced by $9.3 million in supporting letters of credit outstanding, resulting in availability under the Credit Facility of $30.9 million.  The earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019 were reinvested to fund our international operations. If in the future we decide to repatriate earnings, the Company may be required to pay taxes on those amounts, which could reduce the liquidity of the Company at that time.\nOn July 30, 2013, we issued $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes pursuant to the 7.50% Notes Indenture. The 7.50% Notes were general unsecured obligations of the Company and ranked equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 7.50% Notes were jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that guaranteed indebtedness under the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement and the 6.75% Notes. Interest on the 7.50% Notes was payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning February 1, 2014. Debt issuance costs related to the 7.50% Notes were approximately $5.6 million. After the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the carrying amount of debt was adjusted to the claim amount and all unamortized debt issuance costs prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases were fully expensed.\nDebt Summary\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest Expense and Income\nWe are a U.S. company and we operate through our various foreign legal entities and their branches and subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world. Consequently, our tax provision is based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income is earned. The income tax rates imposed and methods of computing taxable income in these jurisdictions vary. Therefore, as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes. Our effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions. Current income tax expense represents either liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year, nonresident withholding taxes or changes in prior year tax estimates which may result from tax audit adjustments. Our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on the consolidated balance sheet. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In order to determine the amount of deferred tax assets or liabilities, as well as the valuation allowances, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding amounts and sources of future taxable income, where rigs will be deployed and other matters. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, as well as changes in tax laws, could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets and liabilities or valuation allowances, including as discussed below.\nFor a discussion of the new accounting pronouncements that have had or are expected to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 19 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n \u2022 all of the Company's agreements, instruments and other documents evidencing or relating to, or otherwise connected with, any of the Predecessor's equity interests outstanding prior to the Plan Effective Date were cancelled and all such equity interests have no further force or effect.  Fresh Start Accounting\nWe analyze financial results for each of our reportable segments. The reportable segments presented are consistent with our reportable segments discussed in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 17 - Reportable Segments in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion. We monitor our reporting segments based on several criteria, including operating gross margin and operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization. Operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization is computed as revenues less direct operating expenses, and excludes depreciation and amortization expense, where applicable. Operating gross margin percentages are computed as operating gross margin as a percent of revenues. The operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization amounts and percentages should not be used as a substitute for those amounts reported under accounting policies generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), but should be viewed in addition to the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes this information provides valuable insight into the information management considers important in managing the business.\n\nDrilling Services Business\nPredecessor 7.50% Senior Notes, Due August 2020\nIt is our intention to utilize our operating cash flows to fund maintenance and growth of our rental tool assets and drilling rigs. Given the oil and natural gas services market over the past few years, our short-term focus is to preserve liquidity by managing our costs and capital expenditures. While the overall market for oilfield services remains challenging, we are beginning to see a market recovery that is expected to increase our earnings, working capital and capital spending as we pursue attractive investment opportunities.\n (3) a $25 million liquidity covenant was replaced with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirement of 1.0x when excess availability is less than the greater of \nPredecessor 2015 Secured Credit Agreement\nAccrual for Self-Insurance\n (6) the Company was allowed to grant a second priority lien on non-working capital assets in the event of a refinancing of the Term Loan Agreement, \n\nIntangible Assets\nOur obligations under the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement were guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, other than immaterial subsidiaries and subsidiaries generating revenues primarily outside the United States, each of which has executed guaranty agreements, and were secured by first priority liens on our accounts receivable, specified rigs including barge rigs in the Gulf of Mexico ( GOM\u201d) and land rigs in Alaska, certain U.S.-based rental equipment of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors and the equity interests of certain of the Company's subsidiaries. In addition to the liquidity covenant and borrowing base requirements, the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, such as limitations on indebtedness and liens, and restrictions on entry into certain affiliate transactions and payments (including certain payments of dividends).\nWe had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $105.0 million and $59.0 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The following table provides a summary of our cash flow activity:\nSee Item 1A. Risk Factors, for a discussion of risks related to our business.\nReorganization items were $1.2 million and $93.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively. The reorganization items for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, primarily consisted of professional fees in the amount of $1.2 million, related to the Chapter 11 Cases. The reorganization items for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily consisted of gain on settlement of liabilities subject to compromise, loss from fresh start valuation adjustments, professional fees and backstop premium on rights offering in the amount of $191.1 million, $242.6 million, $30.1 million and $11.0 million, respectively, related to the Chapter 11 Cases. Reorganization items were $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily consisting of debt finance costs related to Senior Notes, professional fees, debt finance costs related to the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement and debtor-in-possession financing costs in the amount of $5.4 million, $2.3 million, $1.2 million and $1.0 million respectively, related to the Chapter 11 Cases.\nWe apply the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes. This accounting guidance requires that management make estimates and assumptions affecting amounts recorded as liabilities and related disclosures due to the uncertainty as to final resolution of certain tax matters. Because the recognition of liabilities under this interpretation may require periodic adjustments and may not necessarily imply any change in management's assessment of the ultimate outcome of these items, the amount recorded may not accurately reflect actual outcomes.\nInvesting Activities\n \u2022 the interest rate to (a) LIBOR plus a range of 1.75 percent to 2.25 percent (based on availability) or (b) a base rate plus a range of 0.75 percent to 1.25 percent (based on availability), and \nOther Matters\nThere was no loss on impairment for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 or, the three months ended March 31, 2019. Loss on impairment was $50.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the third quarter of 2018 we had a loss on impairment of $44.0 million which consisted of $34.2 million for Gulf of Mexico inland barge asset group and $9.8 million for international barge asset group. In addition, we performed our 2018 annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter, as of October 1, 2018, and determined that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value and, therefore, the entire goodwill balance of $6.7 million for U.S. rental tools segment was impaired and written off.\nFair Value Measurements\nExecutive Summary\nWe periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements, capital needs and availability of resources in view of expansion plans, operational and other cash needs. To meet our short-term liquidity requirements we primarily rely on our cash on hand and cash from operations. We also have access to cash through the Credit Facility. We expect that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to provide us the ability to fund our current operations and required capital expenditures. We may need to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt principal payments, or pursuits of business opportunities that support our strategy, through additional borrowings or the issuance of additional Successor Common Stock or other forms of equity. Our credit agreements limit our ability to pay dividends. In the past we have not paid dividends on our Predecessor Common Stock and we have no present intention to pay dividends on our Successor Common Stock in the foreseeable future.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to fair value of assets, bad debt, materials and supplies obsolescence, property and equipment, income taxes, workers' compensation and health insurance and contingent liabilities for which settlement is deemed to be probable. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. While we believe that such estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nIn accordance with the Plan, on the Plan Effective Date:\nImpairment of Property, Plant, and Equipment\nWe believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they can be complex and require significant judgments, assumptions and/or estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Other significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the consolidated financial statements.\nOn March 26, 2019, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a second lien term loan credit agreement (the Term Loan Agreement\u201d) with the lenders party thereto (the Term Loan Lenders\u201d) and UMB Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, providing for term loans (the Term Loan\u201d) in the amount of $210.0 million, guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. The Term Loan matures on March 26, 2024.\nOur contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification between ourselves and our customers, including with respect to well control and subsurface risks. We seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks. We also maintain insurance for personal injuries, damage to or loss of equipment and other insurance coverage for various business risks. To the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements, we seek protection through insurance. However, these insurance or indemnification agreements may not adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible.\nU.S. rental tools segment operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization was $69.0 million and $29.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and was $92.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, were primarily driven by revenues discussed above.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $11.1 million and $0.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and was $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We recognized income tax expense due to the jurisdictional mix of income and loss during the period, along with our continued inability to recognize the benefits associated with certain losses as a result of valuation allowances, changes in uncertain tax positions, and the income tax impacts of adjustments made as part of Fresh Start Accounting.\nPlan of Reorganization\n (2) Rig utilization rates are based on a weighted average basis assuming total days availability for all rigs available for service. Rigs acquired or disposed of are treated as added to or removed from the rig fleet as of the date of acquisition or disposal. Rigs that are in operation or fully or partially staffed and on a revenue-producing standby status are considered to be utilized. Rigs under contract that generate revenues during moves between locations or during mobilization or demobilization are also considered to be utilized. Our method of computation of rig utilization may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.  Rental Tools Services Business\n (1) the Credit Facility matures on October 8, 2024, subject to certain restrictions, including the refinancing of the Company's Term Loan Agreement (as defined below), \nGeneral and administrative expense was $18.0 million and $8.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and was $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, were primarily driven by compensation expense and legal fees.\n (1) Percentage amounts are calculated by dividing the operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization by revenue for the respective segment and business lines. \n \u2022 504,577 shares of Successor Common Stock to commitment parties under that certain Backstop Commitment Agreement, dated December 12, 2018 and amended and restated on January 28, 2019, (as amended and restated, the Backstop Commitment Agreement\u201d) in respect of the commitment premium due thereunder; \n (8) we were permitted to make a voluntary prepayment of $35.0 million on our Term Loan on September 20, 2019 without such prepayment being included in the calculation of our fixed charge coverage ratio.  As of December 31, 2019, the borrowing base availability under the Credit Facility was $40.2 million, which was further reduced by $9.3 million in supporting letters of credit outstanding, resulting in availability under the Credit Facility of $30.9 million. As of December 31, 2019, debt issuance costs of $1.5 million ($1.3 million, net of amortization) are being amortized over the term of the Credit Facility on a straight-line basis.\nOn December 12, 2018 (the Petition Date\u201d), Parker and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors\u201d) filed a prearranged plan of reorganization (the Plan\u201d) and commenced voluntary petitions under chapter 11 (the Chapter 11 Cases\u201d) of title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code\u201d) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the Bankruptcy Court\u201d). The Plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on March 7, 2019, and the Debtors emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings on March 26, 2019 (the Plan Effective Date\u201d).\nOperating gross margin (loss) amounts are reconciled to our most comparable U.S. GAAP measure as follows:\nOn October 25, 2018, we entered into a Consent Agreement and a Cash Collateral Agreement, whereby we could open bank accounts not subject to the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement for the purpose of depositing cash to secure certain letters of credit. On October 30, 2018, we deposited $10.0 million into a cash collateral account to support the letters of credit outstanding, which is included in the restricted cash balance on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.\nOn September 20, 2019, we made a voluntary prepayment on the Term Loan of $35.0 million in principal, plus $1.0 million in interest associated with the principal payment. Since the prepayment occurred within the first six months from the closing date, no premium was applicable on the prepayment. As of December 31, 2019, the Term Loan balance was $177.9 million.\n (1) the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation and bylaws; \n \u2022 135,838 shares of Successor Common Stock and 1,548,109 Successor warrants to purchase 1,548,109 shares of Successor Common Stock pro rata to holders of the Predecessor Common Stock; \n \u2022 5,178,860 shares of Successor Common Stock pro rata to 6.75% Note Holders; \nOn March 26, 2019, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, we and certain of our subsidiaries, entered into a credit agreement with the lenders party thereto (the Credit Facility Lenders\u201d), Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and Bank of America, N.A. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, providing for a revolving credit facility (as amended and restated by the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as defined below), the Credit Facility\u201d) with initial aggregate commitments in the amount of $50.0 million, guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. Availability under the Credit Facility is subject to a monthly borrowing base calculation and, prior to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, was based on eligible domestic rental equipment and eligible domestic accounts receivable. The Credit Facility provides for a $30.0 million sublimit of the aggregate commitments that is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Prior to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Credit Facility required us to maintain minimum liquidity of $25.0 million, defined as cash in our liquidity account not to exceed $10.0 million and availability under the borrowing base, allowed for an increase to the aggregate commitments by up to an additional $75.0 million, subject to certain conditions, matured on March 26, 2023, and bore interest either at a rate equal to:\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOperating Activities\nOur business is comprised of two business lines: (1) rental tools services and (2) drilling services. We report our rental tools services business as two reportable segments: (1) U.S. rental tools and (2) International rental tools. We report our drilling services business as two reportable segments: (1) U.S. (lower 48) drilling and (2) International & Alaska drilling. We eliminate inter-segment revenues and expenses.\n (7) the amount allowed for an increase to the aggregate commitments was reduced from $75.0 million to $50.0 million, and \nWe executed various amendments which, among other things: (1) modified the credit facility to an asset-based lending structure, (2) reduced the size of the Revolver to $80.0 million, (3) eliminated the financial maintenance covenants previously in effect and replaced them with a minimum liquidity covenant of $30.0 million and a monthly borrowing base calculation, (4) allowed for the refinancing of our existing Senior Notes with either secured or unsecured debt, (5) added the ability for the Company to designate certain of its subsidiaries as Designated Borrowers\u201d, and (6) permitted the Company to make restricted payments in the form of certain equity interests.\nOur expectations for 2020 results are directly linked to anticipated worldwide rig activity. Thus, there are inherent risks involved, including changes to the current supply and demand outlook, the impact of the coronavirus, and investor pressure on E&P companies to exercise capital discipline and to generate free cash flow. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors for further information regarding the risks facing the Company.\nSuccessor Credit Facility\nContract drilling revenues and expenses, comprised of daywork drilling contracts, call-outs against master service agreements and engineering and related project service contracts, are recognized as services are performed and collection is reasonably assured. For certain contracts, we receive payments contractually designated for the mobilization of rigs and other drilling equipment. Mobilization payments received, and direct costs incurred for the mobilization, are deferred and recognized over the term of the related drilling contract; however, costs incurred to relocate rigs and other drilling equipment to areas in which a contract has not been secured are expensed as incurred. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as both revenues and direct costs. For contracts that are terminated prior to the specified term, early termination payments received by us are recognized as revenues when all contractual requirements are met. Revenues from rental activities are recognized ratably over the rental term which is generally less than six months. Our project related services contracts include engineering, consulting, and project management scopes of work and revenue is typically recognized on a time and materials basis.\nReorganization Items\nThe Term Loan bears interest at a rate of 13.0 percent per annum, payable quarterly on the first day of each January, April, July, and October, beginning July 1, 2019, with 11.0 percent paid in cash and 2.0 percent paid in kind and capitalized by adding such amount to the outstanding principal.\n\nBusiness Risks\nU.S. Rental Tools\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nBased on the risks discussed above, we estimate our liability in excess of insurance coverage and accrue for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Accruals related to insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the insurance claims and our past experience with similar claims. The actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from the amounts estimated. We accrue actuarially determined amounts in our consolidated balance sheet to cover self-insurance retentions for workers' compensation, employers' liability, general liability, automobile liability and health benefits claims. These accruals use historical data based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims to project future losses. These estimates and accruals have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount paid on claims.\nCapital expenditures for 2020 are estimated to range from $85.0 million and $95.0 million and will primarily be directed to our rental tools services business inventory and maintenance capital for our drilling services business. Future capital spending will be evaluated based upon adequate return requirements and available liquidity.\nCash flows from investing activities were a use of cash of $70.3 million and $9.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash flows used in investing activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, included capital expenditures of $71.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively, and $70.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which were primarily used for tubular and other products for our rental tools services business and rig-related maintenance.\nWe do not have any unconsolidated special-purpose entities, off-balance sheet financing arrangements or guarantees of third-party financial obligations. As of December 31, 2019, we have no energy, commodity, or foreign currency derivative contracts.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nReferences to Successor\u201d relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company as of and subsequent to March 31, 2019. References to Predecessor\u201d relate to the financial position of the Company prior to, and results of operations through and including, March 31, 2019. As a result of the adoption of Fresh Start Accounting and the effects of the implementation of the Plan, the Company's consolidated financial statements of the Successor (as of and subsequent to March 31, 2019), are not comparable to its consolidated financial statements of the Predecessor.\n (1) Operating gross margin is calculated as revenues less direct operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization expense. \n (3) the Company issued: \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOther\n \u2022 $10.0 million, \nInternational & Alaska Drilling\n (2) the Company appointed new members to the Successor's board of directors to replace directors of the Predecessor; \nLegal and Investigative Matters\nThe following table presents our average utilization rates and rigs available for service for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, the three months ended March 31, 2019 and year ended December 31, 2018, respectively:\n \u2022 2,827,323 shares of Successor Common Stock pro rata to 7.50% Note Holders; \nChapter 11 Emergence\nThe commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default that accelerated the Company's obligations under the indentures governing the 6.75% Notes and the 7.50% Notes. However, any efforts to enforce such payment obligations were automatically stayed under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The principal balance on the 6.75% Notes and 7.50% Notes of $360.0 million and $225.0 million, respectively, had been reclassed from long-term debt to liabilities subject to compromise as of December 31, 2018. See also Note 2 - Chapter 11 Emergence for further details.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPredecessor 6.75% Senior Notes, Due July 2022\n\nInternational rental tools segment operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization was $10.6 million and $0.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and was $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, were primarily driven by revenues discussed above.\nownership data to ascertain the aggregate costs within the ranges of stock split ratios that the Company's stockholders approved at the Special Meeting. Based upon this analysis, the Board will continue to consider the appropriate ratio to effectuate the Stock Splits. As previously disclosed, the Board, at its sole discretion, may elect to abandon the Stock Splits and the overall deregistration process for any reason, including if it determines that effectuating the Stock Splits would be too costly. Assuming the Board determines to proceed with the Stock Splits and the overall deregistration process, the Company will file with the State of Delaware certificates of amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to effectuate the Stock Splits. Following the effectiveness of the Stock Splits, the Company will file a Form 15 with the SEC certifying that it has less than 300 stockholders, which will terminate the registration of the Company's common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. As a result, the Company would cease to file annual, quarterly, current, and other reports and documents with the SEC, and stockholders will cease to receive annual reports and proxy statements. Even if the Company effectuates the Stock Splits and terminates its registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, the Company intends to continue to prepare audited annual and unaudited quarterly financial statements and to make such information available to its stockholders on a voluntary basis. However, the Company would not be required to do so by law and there is no assurance that even if the Company did make such information available that it would continue to do so in the future.\nInterest expense was $20.9 million and $0.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and was $42.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company emerged from bankruptcy at the end of the first quarter of 2019, which resulted in a decrease in overall debt balance. Interest income was $0.9 million and nominal for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively. Interest income was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

We have not accrued any amounts for other matters for which the liability is not probable and reasonably estimable. Generally, the estimate of probable costs related to these matters is developed in consultation with our legal advisors. The estimates take into consideration factors such as the complexity of the issues, litigation risks and settlement costs. If the actual settlement costs, final judgments, or fines, after appeals, differ from our estimates, our future financial results may be adversely affected.\nFor purposes of recording fair value adjustments for certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities, and determining fair value disclosures, we estimate fair value at a price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market for the asset or liability. Our valuation technique requires inputs that we categorize using a three-level hierarchy, from highest to lowest level of observable inputs, as follows: (1) unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1), (2) direct or indirect observable inputs, including quoted prices or other market data, for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or identical assets or liabilities in less active markets (Level 2) and (3) unobservable inputs that require significant judgment for which there is little or no market data (Level 3). When multiple input levels are required for a valuation, we categorize the entire fair value measurement according to the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement even though we may have also utilized significant inputs that are more readily observable.\nThe Term Loan is subject to mandatory prepayments and customary reinvestment rights. The mandatory prepayments include prepayment requirements with respect to a change of control, asset sales and debt issuances, in each case subject to certain exceptions or conditions. The Term Loan Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including as to compliance with laws (including environmental laws and anti-corruption laws), delivery of quarterly and annual financial statements, conduct of business, maintenance of property, maintenance of insurance, restrictions on the incurrence of liens, indebtedness, asset dispositions, fundamental changes, restricted payments and other customary covenants. Additionally, the Term Loan Agreement contains customary events of default and remedies for facilities of this nature. If we do not comply with the covenants in the Term Loan Agreement, the Term Loan Lenders may, subject to customary cure rights, require immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all the financial covenants under the Term Loan Agreement.\nOn December 12, 2018, prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors entered into a restructuring support agreement (as amended on January 28, 2019, the RSA\u201d) with certain significant holders of (1) 7.50% Senior Notes, due 2020 (the 7.50% Note Holders\u201d) issued pursuant to the indenture (the 7.50% Notes Indenture\u201d) dated July 30, 2013 (the 7.50% Notes\u201d), by and among Parker Drilling, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the Trustee\u201d), (2) 6.75% Senior Notes, due 2022 (the 6.75% Note Holders\u201d) issued pursuant to the indenture (the 6.75% Notes Indenture\u201d) dated January 22, 2014 (the 6.75% Notes\u201d and together with the 7.50% Notes, the Senior Notes\u201d), by and among Parker Drilling, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and the Trustee, (3) Parker Drilling's existing common stock (the Predecessor Common Stock\u201d) and (4) Parker Drilling's 7.25% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (the Predecessor Preferred Stock\u201d and such holders to support a restructuring (the Restructuring\u201d) on the terms set forth in the Plan.\nAll of the Company's obligations under the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement were paid prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, and the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement, including the Revolver thereunder, was terminated concurrently with the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. See also Note 2 - Chapter 11 Emergence for further details. Unamortized debt issuance costs were fully expensed upon termination of the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement.\nInternational & Alaska drilling segment revenues were $219.7 million and $77.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and was $213.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, were primarily driven by O&M revenue and revenue from Company-owned rigs.\nInternational Rental Tools\nRevenues were $472.4 million and $157.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and $480.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating gross margin was $56.7 million and $11.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and a loss of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n \u2022 4,903,308 shares of Successor Common Stock to participants in the rights offering extended by Parker to the applicable classes under the Plan (including to the commitment parties party to the Backstop Commitment Agreement); and \nCash Flow Activity\n\nAsset impairment evaluations are, by nature, highly subjective. They involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets and reflect management's assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels, dayrates and costs. The use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets.\nResults of Operations\nfacilities of this nature. If we do not comply with the financial and other covenants in the Credit Facility, the Credit Facility Lenders may, subject to customary cure rights, require immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility, and any outstanding unfunded commitments may be terminated. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all the financial covenants under the Credit Facility.\nOn January 9, 2020, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the Special Meeting\u201d). At the Special Meeting, the holders of a majority of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote approved amendments to the Company's certificate of incorporation, as amended (the Certificate of Incorporation\u201d), to effect a reverse stock split of the Company's common stock (the Reverse Stock Split\u201d), followed immediately by a forward stock split of the Company's common stock (the Forward Stock Split,\u201d and together with the Reverse Stock Split, the Stock Splits\u201d), at a ratio (i) not less than 1-for-5 and not greater than 1-for-100, in the case of the Reverse Stock Split, and (ii) not less than 5-for-1 and not greater than 100-for-1, in the case of the Forward Stock Split. If the Stock Splits are effectuated, then as a result of the Stock Splits, a stockholder owning immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split fewer than a minimum number of shares, which, depending on the stock split ratios chosen by the Board, would be between 5 and 100, would be paid $30.00, without interest, for each share of common stock held by such holder immediately prior to the effective time. Cashed out stockholders would no longer be stockholders of the Company. On January 29, 2019, in connection with the anticipated Stock Splits, the Company filed a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) to voluntarily delist its common stock from trading on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE\u201d) and to deregister its common stock under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d). The delisting occurred ten calendar days after the filing of the Form 25 so that trading was suspended on February 10, 2020, prior to the market opening. Following the delisting, the Company's Board has continued to evaluate updated\nRevenues were $472.4 million and $157.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and $480.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating gross margin was $56.7 million and $11.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and a loss of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe expect the international rig count to increase approximately 3% in 2020 with improvement mainly coming from Mexico, the UAE, Iraq, and Egypt. The areas in which the anticipated increase will occur should bode well for Parker. Our International rental tools segment revenue is anticipated to increase as we continue to win projects utilizing our well construction, well intervention, and surface and tubular goods in the Middle East, the UK, and Latin America. Our International and Alaska drilling segment results are expected to increase as we have won numerous contracts recently, including a 5-year extension of our Sakhalin Island contract and the addition of two O&M contracts in Alaska. In total, the backlog for our O&M contracts has grown to $627 million.\nLoss on Impairment\nManagement's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We use rounded numbers in the Management Discussion and Analysis section which may result in slight differences with results reported under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nU.S. rental tools segment revenues were $144.7 million and $52.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and were $176.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, were primarily driven by customer activity in U.S. land and offshore rentals.\nNine Months Ended December 31, 2019, Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 and the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nSuccessor Term Loan, Due March 2024\nforeign withholding taxes though it is not practicable to determine the resulting liability, if any, that would result on the distribution of such earnings. We annually review our position and may elect to change our future tax position.\nInternational rental tools segment revenues were $71.3 million and $21.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and was $79.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, were primarily driven by well construction, well intervention services, and surface and tubular services.\n (2) our annual borrowing costs under the Credit Facility are lowered by reducing \n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly cyclical. Activity levels are driven by traditional energy industry activity indicators, which include current and expected commodity prices, drilling rig counts, footage drilled, well counts, and our customers' spending levels allocated to exploratory and development drilling.\n \u2022 a base rate plus an applicable margin that varies from 1.25 percent to 1.75 percent per annum.  Prior to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we were required to pay a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum on the actual daily unused portion of the current aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility. We are required to pay customary letter of credit and fronting fees under the Credit Facility.\nOther Financial Data\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated for losses that may occur resulting from disputed amounts and the inability of our customers to pay amounts owed. We estimate the allowance based on historical write-off experience and information about specific customers. We review individually, for collectability, all balances over 90 days past due as well as balances due from any customer with respect to which we have information leading us to believe that a risk exists for potential collection.\n \u2022 90,558 shares of Successor Common Stock and 1,032,073 Successor warrants to purchase 1,032,073 shares of Successor Common Stock pro rata to holders of the Predecessor Preferred Stock; \nLiquidity\nHistorical market indicators are listed below:\nAs of December 31, 2019, our principal amount of debt was related to the $177.9 million Term Loan, due 2024.\nThe following table provides a summary of our total liquidity:\nFinancial Results\n(2) Excludes Canadian rig count.\n \u2022 1,403,910 shares of Successor Common Stock to the commitment parties under the Backstop Commitment Agreement in connection with their backstop obligation thereunder to purchase unsubscribed shares of Successor Common Stock; and \nWe evaluate the carrying amounts of long-lived assets for potential impairment when events occur or circumstances change that indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. For example, evaluations are performed when we experience sustained significant declines in utilization and dayrates, and we do not contemplate recovery in the near future. In addition, we evaluate our assets when we reclassify property and equipment to assets held for sale or as discontinued operations as prescribed by accounting guidance related to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. We determine recoverability by evaluating the undiscounted estimated future net cash flows. When impairment is indicated, we measure the impairment as the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value. Management considers a number of factors such as estimated future cash flows, appraisals and current market value analysis in determining fair value. Assets are written down to fair value if the concluded current fair value is below the net carrying value.\nPre-petition Restructuring Charges\nOutlook\nGain (loss) on disposition of assets, net was a gain of $0.2 million and a gain of $0.4 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and a loss of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We periodically sell equipment deemed to be excess, obsolete, or not currently required for operations.\nThe following is an analysis of our operating results for the comparable periods by reportable segment:\n (4) an additional borrower was allowed to be included in the borrowing base upon completion of a field examination, \n (1) The number of rigs available for service is determined by calculating the number of days each rig was in our fleet and was under contract or available for contract. For example, a rig under contract or available for contract for six months of a year is 0.5 rigs available for service during such year. Our method of computation of rigs available for service may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. \n (1) As of December 31, 2019, approximately $51.9 million of the $105.0 million of cash and equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. \n \u2022 LIBOR plus an applicable margin that varies from 2.25 percent to 2.75 percent per annum or \nAs previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 26, 2019, our obligations with respect to the Senior Notes as well as our subsidiaries' obligations under their respective guarantees under the 6.75% Notes Indenture and the 7.50% Notes Indenture (and the Senior Notes) were cancelled and extinguished as provided in the Plan. From and after March 26, 2019, neither the Company nor its subsidiaries have any continuing obligations under the 6.75% Notes Indenture and 7.50% Notes Indenture or with respect to the Senior Notes or the guarantees related thereto except to the extent specifically provided in the Plan.\nUpon emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting ( Fresh Start Accounting\u201d) in accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 852, Reorganizations ( Topic 852\u201d), which resulted in the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. See Note 2 - Chapter 11 Emergence and Note 3 - Fresh Start Accounting for further details. We evaluated the events between March 26, 2019 and March 31, 2019 and concluded that the use of an accounting convenience date of March 31, 2019, (the Fresh Start Reporting Date\u201d) would not have a material impact on our results of operations or balance sheet. As such, the application of fresh start accounting was reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019, and fresh start accounting adjustments related thereto were included in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019.\nSubstantially all of our operations are subject to hazards that are customary for oil and natural gas drilling operations, including blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, lost or stuck drill strings, equipment defects, cratering, oil and natural gas well fires and explosions, natural disasters, pollution, mechanical failure and damage or loss during transportation. Some of our fleet is also subject to hazards inherent in marine operations, either while on-site or during mobilization, such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision, damage from severe weather and marine life infestations. These hazards could result in damage to or destruction of drilling equipment, personal injury and property damage, suspension of operations or environmental damage, which could lead to claims by third parties or customers, suspension of operations and contract terminations. We have had accidents in the past due to some of these hazards.\nOther income and expense was an expense of $0.2 million and nominal for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and an expense of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Activity in all periods primarily included the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nU.S. (lower 48) drilling segment operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization was a gain of $6.6 million and a loss of $0.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and a loss of $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, were primarily driven by revenues discussed above.\nOur ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets requires that we achieve certain future earnings levels prior to expiration. Evaluations of the realizability of deferred tax assets are, by nature, highly subjective. They involve expectations about future operations and reflect management's assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels, dayrates and costs. The use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different determinations of our ability to realize deferred tax assets. In the event that our earnings performance projections do not indicate that we will be able to benefit from our deferred tax assets, valuation allowances are established following the more likely than not\u201d criteria. We periodically evaluate our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and, in accordance with accounting guidance related to accounting for income taxes, will record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense in the period for which an existing estimate changes.\nGain (Loss) on Disposition of Assets, Net\nAs the determination of our liability for insurance claims could be material and is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts, management believes that accounting estimates related to insurance accruals are critical.\nStockholder Approval of Stock Splits Transaction and Delisting of our Common Stock from the New York Stock Exchange\nU.S. (lower 48) drilling segment revenues were $36.7 million and $6.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and was $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, were primarily driven by our inland barge rig fleet and O&M revenue.\nCash flows from operating activities were a source of cash of $61.6 million and $14.9 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and a use of cash of $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash flows from operating activities in each period were largely impacted by our operating results and changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were a use of cash of $20.7 million and a source of cash of $17.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and a use of cash of $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n(3) Average daily commodity prices for the periods indicated based on NYMEX front-month composite energy prices.\n \u2022 the unused commitment fee to a range of 0.25 percent to 0.375 percent (based on utilization), \nInternational & Alaska drilling segment operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization was $32.0 million and $7.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and was $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, were primarily driven by revenues discussed above.\nOn January 26, 2015, we entered into the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement. The 2015 Secured Credit Agreement was originally comprised of a $200.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolver\u201d). The 2015 Secured Credit Agreement formerly included financial maintenance covenants, including a leverage ratio, consolidated interest coverage ratio, senior secured leverage ratio, and asset coverage ratio, many of which were suspended beginning in September 2015.\nOn October 8, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d), which amended and restated the Credit Facility. As a result of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement:\nFor discussion related to the results of operations and change in financial condition of our Predecessor for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 11, 2019.\n \u2022 20.0 percent of the lesser of commitments and the borrowing base and \nOn January 22, 2014, we issued $360.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.75% Notes pursuant to the 6.75% Notes Indenture. The 6.75% Notes were general unsecured obligations of the Company and ranked equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 6.75% Notes were jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that guaranteed indebtedness under the Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement, as amended from time-to-time ( 2015 Secured Credit Agreement\u201d) and our 7.50% Notes. Interest on the 6.75% Notes was payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning July 15, 2014. Debt issuance costs related to the 6.75% Notes were approximately $7.6 million. After the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the carrying amount of debt was adjusted to the claim amount and all unamortized debt issuance costs prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases were fully expensed.\nCash flows from financing activities were a use of $35.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, primarily related to the $35.2 million prepayment of the Term Loan (as defined below). Cash flows from financing activities were a source of cash of $84.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily related to proceeds from the rights offering of $95.0 million, partially offset by the payment of amounts borrowed under debtor in possession financing of $10.0 million. Cash flows from financing activities were a source of cash of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to amounts borrowed against the DIP Facility of $10.0 million and payments of $3.6 million, $1.4 million and $1.0 million for dividends on the Predecessor's Preferred Stock, debt issuance cost related to the Fifth Amendment to the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement and debtors-in-possession financing costs respectively.\nU.S. (Lower 48) Drilling\nFor 2020, we expect the U.S. land rig count to be relatively flat to year end levels after a 26% decline during 2019 while the U.S. offshore rig count is expected to increase approximately 10%. The net impact should translate into a decrease in our year over year U.S. rental tools business results and a small increase in our barge rig utilization, although overall results for our U.S. (lower 48) drilling segment should decrease due to a shift from rig activation to lower margin plug and abandonment activity on our California O&M.\nThere were no pre-petition charges for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 or the three months ended March 31, 2019. Pre-petition charges were $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily consisting of professional fees related to the Chapter 11 Cases.\nFinancing Activities\nWe may voluntarily prepay all or a part of the Term Loan and, under certain conditions we are required to prepay all or a part of the Term Loan, in each case, at a premium (1) on or prior to 6 months after the closing date of 0 percent; (2) from 6 months and on or prior to two years after the closing date of 6.50 percent; (3) from two years and on or prior to three years after the closing date of 3.25 percent; and (4) from three years after the closing date and thereafter of 0 percent.\nWe do not currently provide for deferred taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as such earnings were reinvested to fund our international operations. If the unremitted earnings were to be distributed, we could be subject to taxes and\nOur intangible assets are related to customer relationships, trade names and developed technology, and are amortized over a period of approximately three, five and six years, respectively. We assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indicators of impairment are present based on expected future profitability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to our overall operations. Should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the intangible assets would be recognized as an impairment loss.\n (2) As of December 31, 2019, the borrowing base availability under the Credit Facility was $40.2 million, which was further reduced by $9.3 million in supporting letters of credit outstanding, resulting in availability under the Credit Facility of $30.9 million.  The earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019 were reinvested to fund our international operations. If in the future we decide to repatriate earnings, the Company may be required to pay taxes on those amounts, which could reduce the liquidity of the Company at that time.\nOn July 30, 2013, we issued $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes pursuant to the 7.50% Notes Indenture. The 7.50% Notes were general unsecured obligations of the Company and ranked equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 7.50% Notes were jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that guaranteed indebtedness under the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement and the 6.75% Notes. Interest on the 7.50% Notes was payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning February 1, 2014. Debt issuance costs related to the 7.50% Notes were approximately $5.6 million. After the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the carrying amount of debt was adjusted to the claim amount and all unamortized debt issuance costs prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases were fully expensed.\nDebt Summary\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest Expense and Income\nWe are a U.S. company and we operate through our various foreign legal entities and their branches and subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world. Consequently, our tax provision is based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income is earned. The income tax rates imposed and methods of computing taxable income in these jurisdictions vary. Therefore, as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes. Our effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions. Current income tax expense represents either liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year, nonresident withholding taxes or changes in prior year tax estimates which may result from tax audit adjustments. Our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on the consolidated balance sheet. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In order to determine the amount of deferred tax assets or liabilities, as well as the valuation allowances, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding amounts and sources of future taxable income, where rigs will be deployed and other matters. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, as well as changes in tax laws, could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets and liabilities or valuation allowances, including as discussed below.\nFor a discussion of the new accounting pronouncements that have had or are expected to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 19 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n \u2022 all of the Company's agreements, instruments and other documents evidencing or relating to, or otherwise connected with, any of the Predecessor's equity interests outstanding prior to the Plan Effective Date were cancelled and all such equity interests have no further force or effect.  Fresh Start Accounting\nWe analyze financial results for each of our reportable segments. The reportable segments presented are consistent with our reportable segments discussed in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 17 - Reportable Segments in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion. We monitor our reporting segments based on several criteria, including operating gross margin and operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization. Operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization is computed as revenues less direct operating expenses, and excludes depreciation and amortization expense, where applicable. Operating gross margin percentages are computed as operating gross margin as a percent of revenues. The operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization amounts and percentages should not be used as a substitute for those amounts reported under accounting policies generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), but should be viewed in addition to the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes this information provides valuable insight into the information management considers important in managing the business.\n\nDrilling Services Business\nPredecessor 7.50% Senior Notes, Due August 2020\nIt is our intention to utilize our operating cash flows to fund maintenance and growth of our rental tool assets and drilling rigs. Given the oil and natural gas services market over the past few years, our short-term focus is to preserve liquidity by managing our costs and capital expenditures. While the overall market for oilfield services remains challenging, we are beginning to see a market recovery that is expected to increase our earnings, working capital and capital spending as we pursue attractive investment opportunities.\n (3) a $25 million liquidity covenant was replaced with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirement of 1.0x when excess availability is less than the greater of \nPredecessor 2015 Secured Credit Agreement\nAccrual for Self-Insurance\n (6) the Company was allowed to grant a second priority lien on non-working capital assets in the event of a refinancing of the Term Loan Agreement, \n\nIntangible Assets\nOur obligations under the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement were guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, other than immaterial subsidiaries and subsidiaries generating revenues primarily outside the United States, each of which has executed guaranty agreements, and were secured by first priority liens on our accounts receivable, specified rigs including barge rigs in the Gulf of Mexico ( GOM\u201d) and land rigs in Alaska, certain U.S.-based rental equipment of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors and the equity interests of certain of the Company's subsidiaries. In addition to the liquidity covenant and borrowing base requirements, the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, such as limitations on indebtedness and liens, and restrictions on entry into certain affiliate transactions and payments (including certain payments of dividends).\nWe had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $105.0 million and $59.0 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The following table provides a summary of our cash flow activity:\nSee Item 1A. Risk Factors, for a discussion of risks related to our business.\nReorganization items were $1.2 million and $93.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively. The reorganization items for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, primarily consisted of professional fees in the amount of $1.2 million, related to the Chapter 11 Cases. The reorganization items for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily consisted of gain on settlement of liabilities subject to compromise, loss from fresh start valuation adjustments, professional fees and backstop premium on rights offering in the amount of $191.1 million, $242.6 million, $30.1 million and $11.0 million, respectively, related to the Chapter 11 Cases. Reorganization items were $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily consisting of debt finance costs related to Senior Notes, professional fees, debt finance costs related to the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement and debtor-in-possession financing costs in the amount of $5.4 million, $2.3 million, $1.2 million and $1.0 million respectively, related to the Chapter 11 Cases.\nWe apply the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes. This accounting guidance requires that management make estimates and assumptions affecting amounts recorded as liabilities and related disclosures due to the uncertainty as to final resolution of certain tax matters. Because the recognition of liabilities under this interpretation may require periodic adjustments and may not necessarily imply any change in management's assessment of the ultimate outcome of these items, the amount recorded may not accurately reflect actual outcomes.\nInvesting Activities\n \u2022 the interest rate to (a) LIBOR plus a range of 1.75 percent to 2.25 percent (based on availability) or (b) a base rate plus a range of 0.75 percent to 1.25 percent (based on availability), and \nOther Matters\nThere was no loss on impairment for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 or, the three months ended March 31, 2019. Loss on impairment was $50.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the third quarter of 2018 we had a loss on impairment of $44.0 million which consisted of $34.2 million for Gulf of Mexico inland barge asset group and $9.8 million for international barge asset group. In addition, we performed our 2018 annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter, as of October 1, 2018, and determined that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value and, therefore, the entire goodwill balance of $6.7 million for U.S. rental tools segment was impaired and written off.\nFair Value Measurements\nExecutive Summary\nWe periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements, capital needs and availability of resources in view of expansion plans, operational and other cash needs. To meet our short-term liquidity requirements we primarily rely on our cash on hand and cash from operations. We also have access to cash through the Credit Facility. We expect that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to provide us the ability to fund our current operations and required capital expenditures. We may need to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt principal payments, or pursuits of business opportunities that support our strategy, through additional borrowings or the issuance of additional Successor Common Stock or other forms of equity. Our credit agreements limit our ability to pay dividends. In the past we have not paid dividends on our Predecessor Common Stock and we have no present intention to pay dividends on our Successor Common Stock in the foreseeable future.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to fair value of assets, bad debt, materials and supplies obsolescence, property and equipment, income taxes, workers' compensation and health insurance and contingent liabilities for which settlement is deemed to be probable. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. While we believe that such estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nIn accordance with the Plan, on the Plan Effective Date:\nImpairment of Property, Plant, and Equipment\nWe believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they can be complex and require significant judgments, assumptions and/or estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Other significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the consolidated financial statements.\nOn March 26, 2019, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a second lien term loan credit agreement (the Term Loan Agreement\u201d) with the lenders party thereto (the Term Loan Lenders\u201d) and UMB Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, providing for term loans (the Term Loan\u201d) in the amount of $210.0 million, guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. The Term Loan matures on March 26, 2024.\nOur contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification between ourselves and our customers, including with respect to well control and subsurface risks. We seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks. We also maintain insurance for personal injuries, damage to or loss of equipment and other insurance coverage for various business risks. To the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements, we seek protection through insurance. However, these insurance or indemnification agreements may not adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible.\nU.S. rental tools segment operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization was $69.0 million and $29.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and was $92.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, were primarily driven by revenues discussed above.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $11.1 million and $0.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and was $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We recognized income tax expense due to the jurisdictional mix of income and loss during the period, along with our continued inability to recognize the benefits associated with certain losses as a result of valuation allowances, changes in uncertain tax positions, and the income tax impacts of adjustments made as part of Fresh Start Accounting.\nPlan of Reorganization\n (2) Rig utilization rates are based on a weighted average basis assuming total days availability for all rigs available for service. Rigs acquired or disposed of are treated as added to or removed from the rig fleet as of the date of acquisition or disposal. Rigs that are in operation or fully or partially staffed and on a revenue-producing standby status are considered to be utilized. Rigs under contract that generate revenues during moves between locations or during mobilization or demobilization are also considered to be utilized. Our method of computation of rig utilization may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.  Rental Tools Services Business\n (1) the Credit Facility matures on October 8, 2024, subject to certain restrictions, including the refinancing of the Company's Term Loan Agreement (as defined below), \nGeneral and administrative expense was $18.0 million and $8.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and was $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, were primarily driven by compensation expense and legal fees.\n (1) Percentage amounts are calculated by dividing the operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization by revenue for the respective segment and business lines. \n \u2022 504,577 shares of Successor Common Stock to commitment parties under that certain Backstop Commitment Agreement, dated December 12, 2018 and amended and restated on January 28, 2019, (as amended and restated, the Backstop Commitment Agreement\u201d) in respect of the commitment premium due thereunder; \n (8) we were permitted to make a voluntary prepayment of $35.0 million on our Term Loan on September 20, 2019 without such prepayment being included in the calculation of our fixed charge coverage ratio.  As of December 31, 2019, the borrowing base availability under the Credit Facility was $40.2 million, which was further reduced by $9.3 million in supporting letters of credit outstanding, resulting in availability under the Credit Facility of $30.9 million. As of December 31, 2019, debt issuance costs of $1.5 million ($1.3 million, net of amortization) are being amortized over the term of the Credit Facility on a straight-line basis.\nOn December 12, 2018 (the Petition Date\u201d), Parker and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors\u201d) filed a prearranged plan of reorganization (the Plan\u201d) and commenced voluntary petitions under chapter 11 (the Chapter 11 Cases\u201d) of title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code\u201d) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the Bankruptcy Court\u201d). The Plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on March 7, 2019, and the Debtors emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings on March 26, 2019 (the Plan Effective Date\u201d).\nOperating gross margin (loss) amounts are reconciled to our most comparable U.S. GAAP measure as follows:\nOn October 25, 2018, we entered into a Consent Agreement and a Cash Collateral Agreement, whereby we could open bank accounts not subject to the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement for the purpose of depositing cash to secure certain letters of credit. On October 30, 2018, we deposited $10.0 million into a cash collateral account to support the letters of credit outstanding, which is included in the restricted cash balance on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.\nOn September 20, 2019, we made a voluntary prepayment on the Term Loan of $35.0 million in principal, plus $1.0 million in interest associated with the principal payment. Since the prepayment occurred within the first six months from the closing date, no premium was applicable on the prepayment. As of December 31, 2019, the Term Loan balance was $177.9 million.\n (1) the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation and bylaws; \n \u2022 135,838 shares of Successor Common Stock and 1,548,109 Successor warrants to purchase 1,548,109 shares of Successor Common Stock pro rata to holders of the Predecessor Common Stock; \n \u2022 5,178,860 shares of Successor Common Stock pro rata to 6.75% Note Holders; \nOn March 26, 2019, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, we and certain of our subsidiaries, entered into a credit agreement with the lenders party thereto (the Credit Facility Lenders\u201d), Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and Bank of America, N.A. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, providing for a revolving credit facility (as amended and restated by the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as defined below), the Credit Facility\u201d) with initial aggregate commitments in the amount of $50.0 million, guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. Availability under the Credit Facility is subject to a monthly borrowing base calculation and, prior to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, was based on eligible domestic rental equipment and eligible domestic accounts receivable. The Credit Facility provides for a $30.0 million sublimit of the aggregate commitments that is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Prior to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Credit Facility required us to maintain minimum liquidity of $25.0 million, defined as cash in our liquidity account not to exceed $10.0 million and availability under the borrowing base, allowed for an increase to the aggregate commitments by up to an additional $75.0 million, subject to certain conditions, matured on March 26, 2023, and bore interest either at a rate equal to:\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOperating Activities\nOur business is comprised of two business lines: (1) rental tools services and (2) drilling services. We report our rental tools services business as two reportable segments: (1) U.S. rental tools and (2) International rental tools. We report our drilling services business as two reportable segments: (1) U.S. (lower 48) drilling and (2) International & Alaska drilling. We eliminate inter-segment revenues and expenses.\n (7) the amount allowed for an increase to the aggregate commitments was reduced from $75.0 million to $50.0 million, and \nWe executed various amendments which, among other things: (1) modified the credit facility to an asset-based lending structure, (2) reduced the size of the Revolver to $80.0 million, (3) eliminated the financial maintenance covenants previously in effect and replaced them with a minimum liquidity covenant of $30.0 million and a monthly borrowing base calculation, (4) allowed for the refinancing of our existing Senior Notes with either secured or unsecured debt, (5) added the ability for the Company to designate certain of its subsidiaries as Designated Borrowers\u201d, and (6) permitted the Company to make restricted payments in the form of certain equity interests.\nOur expectations for 2020 results are directly linked to anticipated worldwide rig activity. Thus, there are inherent risks involved, including changes to the current supply and demand outlook, the impact of the coronavirus, and investor pressure on E&P companies to exercise capital discipline and to generate free cash flow. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors for further information regarding the risks facing the Company.\nSuccessor Credit Facility\nContract drilling revenues and expenses, comprised of daywork drilling contracts, call-outs against master service agreements and engineering and related project service contracts, are recognized as services are performed and collection is reasonably assured. For certain contracts, we receive payments contractually designated for the mobilization of rigs and other drilling equipment. Mobilization payments received, and direct costs incurred for the mobilization, are deferred and recognized over the term of the related drilling contract; however, costs incurred to relocate rigs and other drilling equipment to areas in which a contract has not been secured are expensed as incurred. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as both revenues and direct costs. For contracts that are terminated prior to the specified term, early termination payments received by us are recognized as revenues when all contractual requirements are met. Revenues from rental activities are recognized ratably over the rental term which is generally less than six months. Our project related services contracts include engineering, consulting, and project management scopes of work and revenue is typically recognized on a time and materials basis.\nReorganization Items\nThe Term Loan bears interest at a rate of 13.0 percent per annum, payable quarterly on the first day of each January, April, July, and October, beginning July 1, 2019, with 11.0 percent paid in cash and 2.0 percent paid in kind and capitalized by adding such amount to the outstanding principal.\n\nBusiness Risks\nU.S. Rental Tools\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nBased on the risks discussed above, we estimate our liability in excess of insurance coverage and accrue for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Accruals related to insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the insurance claims and our past experience with similar claims. The actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from the amounts estimated. We accrue actuarially determined amounts in our consolidated balance sheet to cover self-insurance retentions for workers' compensation, employers' liability, general liability, automobile liability and health benefits claims. These accruals use historical data based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims to project future losses. These estimates and accruals have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount paid on claims.\nCapital expenditures for 2020 are estimated to range from $85.0 million and $95.0 million and will primarily be directed to our rental tools services business inventory and maintenance capital for our drilling services business. Future capital spending will be evaluated based upon adequate return requirements and available liquidity.\nCash flows from investing activities were a use of cash of $70.3 million and $9.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash flows used in investing activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, included capital expenditures of $71.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively, and $70.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which were primarily used for tubular and other products for our rental tools services business and rig-related maintenance.\nWe do not have any unconsolidated special-purpose entities, off-balance sheet financing arrangements or guarantees of third-party financial obligations. As of December 31, 2019, we have no energy, commodity, or foreign currency derivative contracts.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nReferences to Successor\u201d relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company as of and subsequent to March 31, 2019. References to Predecessor\u201d relate to the financial position of the Company prior to, and results of operations through and including, March 31, 2019. As a result of the adoption of Fresh Start Accounting and the effects of the implementation of the Plan, the Company's consolidated financial statements of the Successor (as of and subsequent to March 31, 2019), are not comparable to its consolidated financial statements of the Predecessor.\n (1) Operating gross margin is calculated as revenues less direct operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization expense. \n (3) the Company issued: \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOther\n \u2022 $10.0 million, \nInternational & Alaska Drilling\n (2) the Company appointed new members to the Successor's board of directors to replace directors of the Predecessor; \nLegal and Investigative Matters\nThe following table presents our average utilization rates and rigs available for service for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, the three months ended March 31, 2019 and year ended December 31, 2018, respectively:\n \u2022 2,827,323 shares of Successor Common Stock pro rata to 7.50% Note Holders; \nChapter 11 Emergence\nThe commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default that accelerated the Company's obligations under the indentures governing the 6.75% Notes and the 7.50% Notes. However, any efforts to enforce such payment obligations were automatically stayed under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The principal balance on the 6.75% Notes and 7.50% Notes of $360.0 million and $225.0 million, respectively, had been reclassed from long-term debt to liabilities subject to compromise as of December 31, 2018. See also Note 2 - Chapter 11 Emergence for further details.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPredecessor 6.75% Senior Notes, Due July 2022\n\nInternational rental tools segment operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization was $10.6 million and $0.5 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and was $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, were primarily driven by revenues discussed above.\nownership data to ascertain the aggregate costs within the ranges of stock split ratios that the Company's stockholders approved at the Special Meeting. Based upon this analysis, the Board will continue to consider the appropriate ratio to effectuate the Stock Splits. As previously disclosed, the Board, at its sole discretion, may elect to abandon the Stock Splits and the overall deregistration process for any reason, including if it determines that effectuating the Stock Splits would be too costly. Assuming the Board determines to proceed with the Stock Splits and the overall deregistration process, the Company will file with the State of Delaware certificates of amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to effectuate the Stock Splits. Following the effectiveness of the Stock Splits, the Company will file a Form 15 with the SEC certifying that it has less than 300 stockholders, which will terminate the registration of the Company's common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. As a result, the Company would cease to file annual, quarterly, current, and other reports and documents with the SEC, and stockholders will cease to receive annual reports and proxy statements. Even if the Company effectuates the Stock Splits and terminates its registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, the Company intends to continue to prepare audited annual and unaudited quarterly financial statements and to make such information available to its stockholders on a voluntary basis. However, the Company would not be required to do so by law and there is no assurance that even if the Company did make such information available that it would continue to do so in the future.\nInterest expense was $20.9 million and $0.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, and was $42.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company emerged from bankruptcy at the end of the first quarter of 2019, which resulted in a decrease in overall debt balance. Interest income was $0.9 million and nominal for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, and the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively. Interest income was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

"summary": " Here are the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- The report covers the financial results of Parker Drilling for the nine months ended December 31, 2019, the three months ended March 31, 2019, and the year ended December 31, 2018. \n\n- Parker Drilling emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 26, 2019 after filing for bankruptcy protection on December 12, 2018. This impacted the comparability of the financial statements.\n\n- Total revenues were $472.4 million, $157.4 million, and $480.8 million for the respective periods. Operating gross margin was $56.7 million, $11.4 million, and $(4.8) million for the respective periods.\n\n- The rental tools services business accounts for the majority of Parker Drilling's revenues. U.S. rental tools and international rental tools are the two main segments. \n\n- The drilling services business consists of U.S. (lower 48) drilling and international & Alaska drilling segments.\n\n- Operating cash flows were $61.6 million, $14.9 million, and $(17.1) million for the respective periods.\n\n- As of December 31, 2019, Parker Drilling had $105 million in cash and cash equivalents and $30.9 million in availability under its credit facility, for total liquidity of $135.9 million.\n\n- Capital expenditures for 2020 are estimated to range from $85-$95 million, primarily for the rental tools services business.\n\n- The company expects improved results in 2020 based on an expected increase in worldwide rig activity, but there are inherent risks due to industry volatility."}
