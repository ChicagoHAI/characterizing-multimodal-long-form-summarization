MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with \"Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data\" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. The discussion in this report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applying to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" as well as those discussed elsewhere. You should read \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to:\nFuture economic instability in the global economy, which could affect spending on Internet services; the impact of changing foreign exchange rates (in particular the Euro to US dollar and Canadian dollar to US dollar exchange rates) on the translation of our non-US dollar denominated revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities; legal and operational difficulties in new markets; the imposition of a requirement that we contribute to the United States Universal Service Fund on the basis of our Internet revenue; changes in government policy and/or regulation, including rules regarding data protection, cyber security and net neutrality; increasing competition leading to lower prices for our services; our ability to attract new customers and to increase and maintain the volume of traffic on our network; the ability to maintain our Internet peering arrangements on favorable terms; our ability to renew our long-term leases of optical fiber that comprise our network; our reliance on an equipment vendor, Cisco Systems Inc., and the potential for hardware or software problems associated with such equipment; the dependence of our network on the quality and dependability of third-party fiber providers; our ability to retain certain customers that comprise a significant portion of our revenue base; the management of network failures and/or disruptions; and outcomes in litigation as well as other risks discussed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, this annual report on Form 10-K.\nGeneral Overview\nWe are a facilities-based provider of low-cost, high-speed Internet access, private network services and data center colocation space. Our network is specifically designed and optimized to transmit packet-switched data using IP. We deliver our services primarily to small and medium-sized businesses, communications service providers and other bandwidth-intensive organizations in North America, Europe and in Asia.\nOur on-net service consists of high-speed Internet access and private network services at speeds ranging from 100 Megabits per second to 100 Gigabits per second. We offer our on-net services to customers located in buildings that are physically connected to our network. We provide on-net Internet access and private network services to corporate customers and net-centric customers. Our corporate customers are located in multi-tenant office buildings and in our data centers and typically include law firms, financial services firms, advertising and marketing firms and other professional services businesses. Our net-centric customers include bandwidth-intensive users such as other Internet access providers, telephone companies, cable television companies, web hosting companies, content delivery networks and commercial content and application service providers. These net-centric customers generally receive our services in colocation facilities and in our data centers.\nOur off-net services are sold to businesses that are connected to our network primarily by means of \"last mile\" access service lines obtained from other carriers, primarily in the form of metropolitan Ethernet circuits. Our non-core services, which consist primarily of legacy services of companies whose assets or businesses we have acquired. We do not actively market these non-core services and expect the service revenue associated with them to continue to decline.\nOur network is comprised of in-building riser facilities, metropolitan optical fiber networks, metropolitan traffic aggregation points and inter-city transport facilities. Our network is physically connected entirely through our facilities to 2,506 buildings in which we provide our on-net services, including 1,653 multi-tenant office buildings. We also provide on-net services in carrier-neutral data centers, Cogent controlled data centers and single-tenant office buildings. We operate 53 Cogent controlled data centers totaling 603,000 square feet. Because of our integrated network architecture, we are not dependent on local telephone companies or cable companies to serve our on-net customers. We emphasize the sale of our on-net services because we believe we have a competitive advantage in providing these services and these services generate gross profit margins that are greater than the gross profit margins of our off-net services.\nWe believe our key growth opportunity is provided by our high-capacity network, which provides us with the ability to add a significant number of customers to our network with minimal direct incremental costs. Our focus is to add customers to our network in a way that maximizes its use and at the same time provides us with a profitable customer mix. We are responding to this opportunity by increasing our sales and marketing efforts including increasing our number of sales representatives and expanding our network to locations that we believe can be economically integrated and represent significant concentrations of Internet traffic. One of our keys to developing a profitable business will be to carefully match the cost of extending our network to reach new customers with the revenue expected to be generated by those customers. In addition, we may add customers to our network through strategic acquisitions.\nWe believe some of the most important trends in our industry are the continued long-term growth in Internet traffic and a decline in Internet access prices on a per megabit basis. The effective price per megabit for our corporate customers is declining as the bandwidth utilization and connection size of our corporate customer connections increases. As Internet traffic continues to grow and prices per unit of traffic continue to decline, we believe we can continue to load our network and gain market share from less efficient network operators. However, continued erosion in Internet access prices will likely have a negative impact on the rate at which we can increase our revenues and our profitability. Our revenue may also be negatively affected if we are unable to grow our Internet traffic or if the rate of growth of Internet traffic does not offset an expected decline in our per unit pricing. We do not know if Internet traffic will increase or decrease, or the rate at which it will increase or decrease. Changes in Internet traffic will be a function of the number of Internet users, the amount of time users spend on the Internet, the applications for which the Internet is used, the bandwidth intensity of these applications and the pricing of Internet services, and other factors.\nThe growth in Internet traffic has a more significant impact on our net-centric customers who represent the vast majority of the traffic on our network and who tend to consume the majority of their allocated bandwidth on their connections. Net-centric customers tend to purchase their service on a price per megabit basis. Our corporate customers tend to utilize a small portion of their allocated bandwidth on their connections and tend to purchase their service on a per connection basis.\nWe are a facilities-based provider of Internet access and communications services. Facilities-based providers require significant physical assets, or network facilities, to provide their services. Typically when a facilities-based network services provider begins providing its services in a new jurisdiction losses are incurred for several years until economies of scale have been achieved. Our foreign operations are in Europe, Canada, Mexico and Asia. Europe accounts for roughly 75% of our foreign operations. Our European operations have incurred losses and will continue to do so until our European customer base and revenues have grown enough to achieve sufficient economies of scale.\nDue to our strategic acquisitions of network assets and equipment, we believe we are well positioned to grow our revenue base. We continue to purchase and deploy network equipment to parts of our network to maximize the utilization of our assets and to expand and increase the capacity of our\nnetwork. Our future capital expenditures will be based primarily on the expansion of our network and the addition of on-net buildings. We plan to continue to expand our network and to increase the number of on-net buildings we serve including multi-tenant office buildings, carrier neutral data centers and Cogent controlled data centers. Many factors can affect our ability to add buildings to our network. These factors include the willingness of building owners to grant us access rights, the availability of optical fiber networks to serve those buildings, the cost to connect buildings to our network and equipment availability.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOur management reviews and analyzes several key financial measures in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and variability of our service revenue, operating results and cash flows. The following summary tables present a comparison of our results of operations with respect to certain key financial measures. The comparisons illustrated in the tables are discussed in greater detail below.\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Percent\nChange </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>485,175 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>446,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> On-net revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>346,445 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>323,602 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Off-net revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-core revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>961 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (12.8 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network operations expenses(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>209,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>194,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general, and administrative expenses(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gains on equipment transactions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (50.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>170.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM-Not meaningful\n(1)Includes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $604 and $573 for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n(2)Includes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $12,686 and $10,162 for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Percent\nChange </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Operating Data\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Revenue Per Unit (ARPU)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ARPU-on net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>506 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (7.8 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ARPU-off-net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,239 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3.5 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average price per megabit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1.11 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1.34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (17.4 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer Connections-end of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> On-net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61,334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Off-net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nService Revenue. Our service revenue increased 8.6% from 2016 to 2017. Exchange rates positively impacted our increase in service revenue by approximately $1.9 million. All foreign currency comparisons herein reflect results for 2017 translated at the average foreign currency exchange rates for 2016. For 2017 and 2016, on-net, off-net and non-core revenues represented 71.4%, 28.4% and 0.2% and 72.4%, 27.4% and 0.2% of our service revenue, respectively. Revenue recognition standards include guidance relating to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, gross receipts taxes, Universal Service Fund fees and certain state regulatory fees. We record these taxes billed to our customers on a gross basis (as service revenue and network operations expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. The impact of these taxes including the Universal Service Fund resulted in an increase of our revenues for 2017 of approximately $1.8 million.\nRevenue from our corporate and net-centric customers represented 62.3% and 37.7% of our service revenue, respectively, for 2017, and represented 60.4% and 39.6% of our service revenue, respectively, for 2016. Revenue from corporate customers increased 11.8% from $270.1 million for 2016 to $302.1 million for 2017 due to an increase in our number of corporate customers. Revenue from our net-centric customers increased by 3.6% from $176.8 million for 2016 to $183.1 million for 2017 primarily due to an increase in our number of net-centric customers, partially offset by a decline in our average price per megabit.\nOur on-net revenue increased 7.1% from 2016 to 2017. We increased the number of our on-net customer connections by 16.0% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. On-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than on-net revenues primarily due to the 7.8% decline in our on-net ARPU, primarily from a decline in ARPU for our net centric customers. ARPU is determined by dividing revenue for the period by the average customer connections for that period. Our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers is determined by dividing the aggregate monthly recurring fixed charges for those customers by the aggregate committed data rate for the same customers. The decline in on-net ARPU is partly attributed to volume and term based pricing discounts. Additionally, on-net customers who cancel their service from our installed base of customers, in general, have an ARPU that is greater than the ARPU for our new customers due to declining prices primarily for our on-net services sold to our net-centric customers. These trends resulted in the reduction to our on-net ARPU and a 17.4% decline in our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers.\nOur off-net revenue increased 12.7% from 2016 to 2017. Our off-net customer connections increased 15.8% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. Our off-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than our off-net revenue due to the 3.5% decrease in our off-net ARPU.\nOur non-core revenue decreased 12.8% from 2016 to 2017. We do not actively market these acquired non-core services and expect that the service revenue associated with them will continue to decline.\nNetwork Operations Expenses. Network operations expenses include the costs of personnel associated with service delivery, network management, and customer support, network facilities costs, fiber and equipment maintenance fees, leased circuit costs, and access and facilities fees paid to building owners. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense is included in network operations expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation. Our network operations expenses, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, increased 7.8% from 2016 to 2017. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in costs related to our network and facilities expansion activities and the increase in our off-net revenues. When we provide off-net services we also assume the cost of the associated tail-circuits.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\"). Our SG&A expenses, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, increased 6.0% from 2016 to 2017. Non cash equity-based compensation expense is included in SG&A expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation and was $10.2 million for 2016 and $12.7 million for 2017. SG&A expenses increased primarily from an increase in salaries and related costs required to support our expansion and increases in our sales efforts and an increase in our headcount partly offset by a $2.0 million decrease in our legal fees primarily associated with U.S. net neutrality and interconnection regulatory matters and a $3.1 million charge related to a proposed settlement of a class action wage and hour claim for certain of our current and past sales reps that we incurred in 2016. Our sales force headcount increased by 5.9% from 542 at December 31, 2016 to 574 at December 31, 2017 and our total headcount increased by 4.7% from 887 at December 31, 2016 to 929 at December 31, 2017.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses. Our depreciation and amortization expenses increased 0.9% from 2016 to 2017. The increase is primarily due to the depreciation expense associated with the increase related to newly deployed fixed assets more than offsetting the decline in depreciation expense from fully depreciated fixed assets.\nGains on Equipment Transactions. We exchanged certain used network equipment and cash consideration for new network equipment resulting in gains of $7.7 million for 2016 and $3.9 million for 2017. The gains are based upon the excess of the estimated fair value of the new network equipment over the carrying amount of the returned used network equipment and the cash paid.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense results from interest incurred on our $375.0 million of senior secured notes, interest incurred on our $189.2 million of senior unsecured notes, interest on our installment payment agreement and interest on our capital lease obligations. Our interest expense increased by 18.8% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to our issuance of $125.0 million of senior secured notes in December 2016. In the second quarter of 2016, we paid $10.9 million for the purchase of $10.8 million of par value and accrued interest of our $200.0 million senior unsecured notes reducing the principal to $189.2 million and resulting in a loss of $0.2 million. The loss resulted from the write off of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the purchased notes. In June 2016, we elected to repay the outstanding $17.1 million principal balance of the installment payment agreement before its maturity date resulting in a loss of $0.4 million from the remaining unamortized discount.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our income tax expense was $25.2 million for 2017 and $9.3 million for 2016. The increase in our income tax expense was primarily related to an increase in deferred income tax expense due to an increase in income before taxes in the United States and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\"). On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Act. The Act amended the Internal Revenue Code and reduced the corporate tax rate from a maximum rate of 35% to a flat 21% rate. The rate reduction is effective on January 1, 2018 and may reduce our future income taxes payable once we become a cash taxpayer in the United States. As a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate and other provisions under the Act, we were required to revalue our net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017 resulting in a reduction in our net deferred tax asset of $9.0 million and we recorded a transition tax of $2.3 million related to our foreign operations for a total income tax expense of approximately $11.3 million, which was recorded as additional noncash income tax expense in the three months and year ended December 31, 2017. The actual impact on our net deferred tax asset may vary from this amount from certain changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made and as further guidance related to the Act may be issued.\nBuildings On-net. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 we had a total of 2,506 and 2,373 on-net buildings connected to our network, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nOur management reviews and analyzes several key financial measures in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and variability of our service revenue, operating results and cash flows. The following summary tables present a comparison of our results of operations with respect to certain key financial measures. The comparisons illustrated in the tables are discussed in greater detail below.\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Percent\nChange </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Service revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>446,900 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>404,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> On-net revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>323,602 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>294,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Off-net revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-core revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>961 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (6.6 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network operations expenses(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>194,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>174,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general, and administrative expenses(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gains on capital lease terminations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gains on equipment transactions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses on debt extinguishment and redemption\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,280 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.2 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM-Not meaningful\n(1)Includes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $573 and $584 for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n(2)Includes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $10,162 and $10,931 for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Percent\nChange </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Operating Data\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Revenue Per Unit (ARPU)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ARPU-on net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>548 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ARPU-off-net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,284 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5.0 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average price per megabit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1.34 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1.61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (16.8 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer Connections-end of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> On-net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Off-net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nService Revenue. Our service revenue increased 10.6% from 2015 to 2016. Exchange rates negatively impacted our increase in service revenue by approximately $0.9 million. All foreign currency comparisons herein reflect results for 2016 translated at the average foreign currency exchange rates for 2015. For 2016 and 2015, on-net, off-net and non-core revenues represented 72.4%, 27.4% and 0.2% and 72.9%, 26.8% and 0.3% of our service revenue, respectively. Revenue recognition standards include guidance relating to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, gross receipts taxes, Universal Service Fund fees and certain state regulatory fees. We record these taxes\nbilled to our customers on a gross basis (as service revenue and network operations expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. The impact of these taxes including the Universal Service Fund resulted in an increase of our revenues for 2016 of approximately $5.5 million.\nRevenue from our corporate and net-centric customers represented 60.4% and 39.6% of our service revenue, respectively, for 2016, and represented 58.3% and 41.7% of our service revenue, respectively, for 2015. Revenue from corporate customers increased 14.7% from $235.5 million for 2015 to $270.1 million for 2016 due to an increase in our number of corporate customers. Revenue from our net-centric customers increased by 4.8% from $168.7 million for 2015 to $176.8 million for 2016 primarily due to an increase in our number of net-centric customers, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and a decline in our average price per megabit.\nOur on-net revenue increased 9.8% from 2015 to 2016. We increased the number of our on-net customer connections by 16.3% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. On-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than on-net revenues primarily due to the 4.9% decline in our on-net ARPU, primarily from a decline in ARPU for our net centric customers. ARPU is determined by dividing revenue for the period by the average customer connections for that period. Our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers is determined by dividing the aggregate monthly recurring fixed charges for those customers by the aggregate committed data rate for the same customers. The decline in on-net ARPU is partly attributed to volume and term based pricing discounts. Additionally, on-net customers who cancel their service from our installed base of customers, in general, have an ARPU that is greater than the ARPU for our new customers due to declining prices primarily for our on-net services sold to our net-centric customers. These trends resulted in the reduction to our on-net ARPU and a 16.8% decline in our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers.\nOur off-net revenue increased 12.9% from 2015 to 2016. Our off-net customer connections increased 18.1% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Our off-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than our off-net revenue due to the 5.0% decrease in our off-net ARPU.\nOur non-core revenue decreased 6.6% from 2015 to 2016. We do not actively market these acquired non-core services and expect that the service revenue associated with them will continue to decline.\nNetwork Operations Expenses. Network operations expenses include the costs of personnel associated with service delivery, network management, and customer support, network facilities costs, fiber and equipment maintenance fees, leased circuit costs, and access and facilities fees paid to building owners. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense is included in network operations expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation. Our network operations expenses, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, increased 11.2% from 2015 to 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in costs related to our network and facilities expansion activities, a $5.5 million increase in excise taxes billed to our customers recorded on a gross basis (in service revenue and cost of network operations expense) and the increase in our off-net revenues. When we provide off-net services we also assume the cost of the associated tail-circuits.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\"). Our SG&A expenses, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, increased 6.7% from 2015 to 2016. Non cash equity-based compensation expense is included in SG&A expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation and was $10.9 million for 2015 and $10.2 million for 2016. SG&A expenses increased primarily from an increase in salaries and related costs required to support our expansion and increases in our sales efforts, an increase in our headcount and a $3.1 million charge related to a proposed settlement of a class action wage and hour claim for certain of our current and past sales reps, partly offset by a $0.5 million decrease in our legal fees primarily associated with U.S.\nnet neutrality and interconnection regulatory matters. Our sales force headcount increased by 9.5% from 495 at December 31, 2015 to 542 at December 31, 2016 and our total headcount increased by 7.1% from 828 at December 31, 2015 to 887 at December 31, 2016.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses. Our depreciation and amortization expenses increased 6.7% from 2015 to 2016. The increase is primarily due to the depreciation expense associated with the increase related to newly deployed fixed assets more than offsetting the decline in depreciation expense from fully depreciated fixed assets.\nGains on Equipment Transactions. We exchanged certain used network equipment and cash consideration for new network equipment resulting in gains of $5.4 million for 2015 and $7.7 million for 2016. The gains are based upon the excess of the estimated fair value of the new network equipment over the carrying amount of the returned used network equipment and the cash paid.\nGains on capital lease terminations. In March 2015 we elected to terminate certain IRU capital lease obligations with a vendor. Under our estimate of the termination provisions of the related contract we recorded an estimated termination liability of $8.1 million in March 2015. The difference between the remaining net present value of the related IRU capital leases, the remaining net book value of the IRU assets and the termination liability and amounts due through the termination date was recorded as a gain on capital lease termination of $10.1 million in 2015.\nIn July 2015, we settled a dispute for the payment of the remaining balances for certain IRU capital lease obligations with a vendor. The IRU assets were fully depreciated in 2012 when the related fiber was replaced and was no longer used by us. The difference between the remaining net present value of the related IRU capital lease obligation and the settlement liability was recorded as a gain on lease obligations of $1.5 million.\nDebt extinguishment, redemption and new debt issuance-$250.0 million. In March 2015, we redeemed our $240.0 million 8.375% senior notes due in 2018 at a redemption price of 104.188% of the $240.0 million principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest with the proceeds from our February 2015 issuance of $250.0 million of 5.375% senior secured notes and existing cash on hand. As a result of this transaction we incurred a loss on debt extinguishment and redemption of $10.1 million in 2015.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense results from interest incurred on our $125.0 million of senior secured notes that we issued on December 2, 2016, $250.0 million of senior secured notes that we issued on February 20, 2015, $200.0 million of senior unsecured notes that we issued on April 9, 2014, $240.0 million of senior secured notes that we issued in August 2013 and January 2011 and redeemed in March 2015, interest on our installment payment agreement and interest on our capital lease obligations. Our interest expense decreased by 1.2% primarily due to the March 2015 redemption of our $240 million of 8.375% senior secured notes that carried a higher interest rate than our $250.0 million of 5.375% senior secured notes that we issued in February 2015. Additionally, in March 2015 we elected to terminate $29.9 million of capital lease obligations in Spain with a vendor reducing our interest expense on our capital leases.\nIn the second quarter of 2016, we paid $10.9 million for the purchase of $10.8 million of par value and accrued interest of our $200.0 million senior unsecured notes reducing the principal to $189.2 million and resulting in a loss of $0.2 million. The loss resulted from the write off of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the purchased notes. In June 2016, we elected to repay the outstanding $17.1 million principal balance of our installment payment agreement before its maturity date resulting in a loss of $0.4 million from the remaining unamortized discount.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our income tax expense was $9.3 million for 2016 and $7.8 million for 2015. The increase in our income tax expense was primarily related to an increase in deferred income tax expense due to an increase in income before taxes in the United States.\nBuildings On-net. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 we had a total of 2,373 and 2,251 on-net buildings connected to our network, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn assessing our short term and long term liquidity, management reviews and analyzes our current cash balances, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, capital expenditure and operating expense commitments, and required capital lease, interest and debt payments and other obligations.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated cash flows.\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>111,702 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>107,967 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>83,809 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45,801 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(45,234 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(35,471 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(97,267 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>8,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(128,847 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rates on cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,058 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(346 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,690 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents during the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(27,308 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>70,728 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(84,199 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided By Operating Activities. Our primary source of operating cash is receipts from our customers who are billed on a monthly basis for our services. Our primary uses of operating cash are payments made to our vendors, employees and interest payments made to our capital lease vendors and our note holders. Our changes in cash provided by operating activities are primarily due to changes in our operating profit and changes in our interest payments. Cash provided by operating activities for 2017, 2016 and 2015 includes interest payments on our note obligations of $30.8 million, $24.5 million and $29.3 million, respectively.\nNet Cash Used In Investing Activities. Our primary use of investing cash is for purchases of property and equipment. These amounts were $45.8 million, $45.2 million and $35.6 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The annual changes in purchases of property and equipment are primarily due to the timing and scope of our network expansion activities including geographic expansion and adding buildings to our network. In 2017, 2016 and 2015 we obtained $9.0 million, $5.5 million and $21.9 million, respectively, of network equipment and software in non-cash exchanges for notes payable under an installment payment agreement.\nNet Cash (Used In) Provided By Financing Activities. Our primary uses of cash for financing activities are for dividend payments, stock purchases and principal payments under our capital lease obligations. In 2015 we redeemed our $240.0 million senior secured notes for a payment of $251.3 million. Amounts paid under our stock buyback program were $1.8 million for 2017, $4.5 million for 2016 and $39.4 million for 2015. During 2017, 2016 and 2015 we paid $81.7 million, $68.2 million and $66.3 million, respectively, for our quarterly dividend payments. Our quarterly dividend payments have increased due to regular quarterly increases in our quarterly dividend per share amounts. Principal payments under our capital lease obligations were $11.2 million, $12.5 million and $20.2 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are impacted by the timing and extent of our network expansion activities. Our financing activities also include proceeds from and repayments of our debt offerings. In December 2016 we received net proceeds of $124.3 million from the issuance of our $125.0 million of\nsenior secured notes. In 2015 we received net proceeds of $248.6 million from the issuance of our $250.0 million senior secured notes. During 2016 we paid $10.9 million for the purchase of $10.8 million of par value and accrued interest of our $200.0 million senior unsecured notes and we elected to repay the outstanding $17.1 million principal balance of our installment payment agreement prior to its maturity date. Total installment payment agreement principal payments were $3.8 million, $21.2 million and $0.7 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIndebtedness\nOur total indebtedness, at par, at December 31, 2017 was $732.5 million. Our total indebtedness at December 31, 2017 includes $157.5 million of capital lease obligations for dark fiber primarily under 15-20 year IRUs. Our total cash and cash equivalents were $247.0 million at December 31, 2017.\nOn May 15, 2014, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the \"Merger Agreement\") by and among Cogent Communications Group, Inc. (\"Group\"), a Delaware corporation, Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"Holdings\") and Cogent Communications Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"Merger Sub\"), Group adopted a new holding company organizational structure whereby Group is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings. Holdings is a \"successor issuer\" to Group pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\").\nSenior unsecured notes-$189.2 million\nGroup is obligor on our $189.2 million (originally $200.0 million) of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the \"2021 Notes\"). The 2021 Notes were sold in private offerings for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. Holdings provided a guarantee of the 2021 Notes but Holdings is not subject to the covenants under the indenture. In the second quarter of 2016, we paid $10.9 million for the purchase of $10.8 million of par value and accrued interest on our 2021 Notes reducing the principal amount to $189.2 million.\nDebt extinguishment, redemption and new debt issuances-$375.0 million senior secured notes\nIn March 2015, Group redeemed its $240.0 million 8.375% senior notes due in 2018 (the \"2018 Notes\") with the proceeds from its February 2015 issuance of $250.0 million of 5.375% senior secured notes (the \"2022 Notes\") and existing cash on hand. In February 2015 we deposited $251.6 million with the trustee for the benefit of the holders of the 2018 Notes in order to redeem on March 12, 2015 the entire outstanding amount of 2018 Notes at a redemption price of 104.188% of the $240.0 million principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a result of this transaction we incurred a loss on debt extinguishment and redemption of $10.1 million. In December 2016, we issued an additional $125.0 million of our 2022 Notes at a premium of 100.365%.\nThe 2022 Notes were sold in private offerings for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A and mature on March 1, 2022. Interest accrues at 5.375% and is paid semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The net proceeds from the February 2015 offering were $248.6 million and the net proceeds were $124.3 million from the December 2016 offering after deducting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nSenior secured notes-$240.0 million\nIn January 2011 and in August 2013, we issued our 2018 Notes for aggregate principal amounts of $175.0 million and $65.0 million, respectively, in private offerings for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. The 2018 Notes were secured and bore interest at 8.375% per annum. Interest was payable in cash semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15, of each year. In January 2011, we received net proceeds of $170.5 million after deducting $4.5 million of\nissuance costs from issuing $175.0 million of our 2018 Notes. In August 2013, we received net proceeds of approximately $69.9 million after deducting $1.0 million of issuance costs from issuing $65.0 million of 2018 Notes. The 2018 Notes sold in August 2013 were sold at 109.00% of par value. The resulting $5.9 million premium was being amortized as a reduction to interest expense to the maturity date using the effective interest rate method. In March 2015, the 2018 Notes were extinguished and redeemed with the proceeds of our issuance of our $250.0 million of 2022 Notes and cash on hand.\nLimitations under the indentures\nThe indentures governing our 2022 and 2021 Notes, among other things, limit our ability to incur indebtedness; to pay dividends or make other distributions; to make certain investments and other restricted payments; to create liens; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; to incur restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends or make other payments; and to enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. Limitations on the ability to incur additional indebtedness (excluding IRU agreements incurred in the normal course of business) include a restriction on incurring additional indebtedness if our consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the indentures, is greater than 5.0. The indentures prohibit certain payments, such as dividends and stock purchases, when our consolidated leverage ratio, as defined by the indentures, is greater than 4.25. The unrestricted payment amount may be increased by our consolidated cash flow, as defined in the indentures, as long as our consolidated leverage ratio is less than 4.25. Our consolidated leverage ratio is currently above 4.25 as of December 31, 2017, and we have a total of $64.3 million that is permitted for investment payments including dividends and stock purchases.\nSummarized Financial Information of Holdings\nHoldings is a guarantor under the 2021 and 2022 Notes. Under the indentures we are required to disclose financial information of Holdings including its assets, liabilities and its operating results (\"Holdings Financial Information\"). The Holdings Financial Information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 is detailed below (in thousands).\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>December 31, 2017 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(Unaudited)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>62,857 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>62,857 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment from subsidiaries\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>214,591 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accumulated deficit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(151,780 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>62,857 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(Unaudited)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity-based compensation expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>14,504 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>809 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(13,695 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommon Stock Buyback Program\nOur Board of Directors has approved through December 31, 2018, purchases of our common stock under a buyback program (the \"Buyback Program\"). We purchased 0.1 million shares of our common stock for $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, 0.1 million shares of our common stock for $4.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 1.2 million shares of our common stock for $39.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2017 there was a total of $41.5 million available under the Buyback Program.\nDividends on Common Stock\nDividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. Dividends on unvested restricted shares of common stock are paid as the awards vest. Our initial quarterly dividend payment was made in the third quarter of 2012. On February 21, 2018, our Board of Directors approved the payment of our quarterly dividend of $0.50 per common share. The dividend for the first quarter of 2018 will be paid to holders of record on March 9, 2018. This estimated $22.4 million dividend payment is expected to be made on March 26, 2018.\nThe payment of any future dividends and any other returns of capital, including stock buybacks, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be reduced, eliminated or increased and will be dependent upon our financial position, results of operations, available cash, cash flow, capital requirements, limitations under our debt indentures and other factors deemed relevant by the our Board of Directors. We are a Delaware Corporation and under the General Corporate Law of the State of Delaware distributions may be restricted including a restriction that distributions, including stock purchases and dividends, do not result in an impairment of a corporation's capital, as defined under Delaware Law.

These capital leases are presented on our balance sheet at the net present value of the future minimum lease payments, or $157.5 million at December 31, 2017. These leases generally have initial terms of 15 to 20 years\n(3)These amounts include amounts due under our operating leases.\n(4)These amounts include amounts due under unconditional purchase obligations including dark fiber IRU operating and capital lease agreements entered into prior to December 31, 2017.\nFuture Capital Requirements\nWe believe that our cash on hand and cash generated from our operating activities will be adequate to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service, dividend payments and other cash requirements for the next twelve months if we execute our business plan.\nAny future acquisitions or other significant unplanned costs or cash requirements in excess of amounts we currently hold may require that we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or our stockholders, or at all. Insufficient funds may require us to delay or scale back the number of buildings and markets that we add to our network, reduce our planned increase in our sales and marketing efforts, or require us to otherwise alter our business plan or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If issuing equity securities raises additional funds, substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result.\nWe may need to or elect to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity and we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to refinance any such indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may elect to secure additional capital in the future, at acceptable terms, to improve our liquidity or fund acquisitions or for general corporate purposes. In addition, in an effort to reduce future cash interest payments as well as future amounts due at maturity or to extend debt maturities, we may, from time to time, issue new debt, enter into debt for debt, or cash transactions to purchase our outstanding debt securities in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. We will evaluate any such transactions in light of the existing market conditions. The amounts involved in any such transaction, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.\nIncome Taxes\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in the United States limits the utilization of net operating losses when ownership changes, as defined by that section, occur. We have performed an analysis of our Section 382 ownership changes and have determined that the utilization of certain of our net operating loss carryforwards in the United States is limited.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe accounting policies we believe to be most critical to understanding our financial results and condition or that require complex, significant and subjective management judgments are discussed below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize service revenue when the services are performed, evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable. Service discounts and incentives offered to certain customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue when granted. Fees billed in connection with customer installations are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of estimated customer life or contract term. We determine the estimated customer life using a historical analysis of customer retention and contract terms. If our estimated customer life and contract terms increase, we will recognize installation revenue over a longer period. We expense the direct costs associated with sales as incurred.\nRevenue recognition standards include guidance relating to taxes or surcharges assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but are not limited to, gross receipts taxes, excise taxes, Universal Service Fund fees and certain state regulatory fees. Such charges may be presented gross or net based upon our accounting policy election. We record certain excise taxes and surcharges on a gross basis and includes them in our service revenue and cost of network operations.\nValuation Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Receivable and Deferred Tax Assets\nWe have established allowances associated with uncollectible accounts receivable and certain of our deferred tax assets.\n\u2022 Our valuation allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is designed to account for the expense associated with accounts receivable that we estimate will not be collected. We assess the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating general factors, such as the length of time individual receivables are past due, historical collection experience, and changes in the credit-worthiness of our customers. We also assess the ability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to us and establish specific allowances based on the amount we expect to collect from these customers. If circumstances relating to specific customers change or economic conditions change such that our past collections experience and assessment of the economic environment are no longer appropriate, our estimate of the recoverability of our trade receivables could be impacted.\n\u2022 Our valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset reflects the uncertainty surrounding the realization of our net operating loss carry-forwards and our other deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are established when management determines it is \"more likely than not\" that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. At each balance sheet date, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. We consider all available positive and negative evidence, on a jurisdictional basis, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance including our operating results, ongoing tax planning, and our forecast of future taxable income. We base our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws, rates and interpretations, and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. We develop our estimates of future profitability based on our historical data and experience and our judgment and expectations. Changes in existing tax laws and rates, their related interpretations, and the uncertainty generated by the current economic environment may affect the amounts of our deferred tax liabilities or the valuations of our deferred tax assets overtime. Significant judgment is required with respect to the determination of whether a valuation allowance is required for certain of our deferred tax assets. Our accounting for\ndeferred tax consequences represents management's best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in accounting estimates.\nCapital Lease Obligations\nWe record assets and liabilities under capital leases at the lesser of the present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the assets under lease. We establish the number of renewal option periods used in determining the lease term, if any, based upon our assessment at the inception of the lease of the number of option periods for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in such amount that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. Useful lives are determined based on historical usage with consideration given to technological changes and trends in the industry that could impact the asset utilization. We estimate the fair value of leased assets primarily using estimated replacement cost data for similar assets.\nAccruals for Contingencies\nWe estimate our litigation accruals based upon our estimate of the expected outcome after consultation with legal counsel. In the normal course of business we are involved in other legal activities and claims. Because such matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcomes are not predictable with assurance, the liability related to these legal actions and claims cannot be determined with certainty. In accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies, we accrue our estimate of a contingent liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and there is a range of expected loss for which no amount in the range is more likely than any other amount, we accrue at the low end of the range. We review our accruals at least quarterly and adjust them to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. Judgment is required in estimating the ultimate outcome of any dispute resolution process, as well as any other amounts that may be incurred to conclude the negotiations or settle any litigation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material.\nWe estimate our accruals for disputed leased circuit obligations based upon the nature and age of the dispute. Our network costs are impacted by the timing and amounts of disputed circuit costs. We generally record these disputed amounts when billed by the vendor and reverse these amounts when the vendor credit has been received or the dispute has otherwise been resolved.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements-to be Adopted\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (\"ASU 2016-02\"). ASU 2016-02 will replace most existing lease accounting guidance when it becomes effective. ASU 2016-02 is effective for us beginning on January 1, 2019. Early application is permitted. ASU 2016-02 currently must be adopted using the modified retrospective approach for all leases that exist at or commence after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented (with the option to apply certain practical expedients), which for us will be the period beginning January 1, 2017. However, in January 2018 the FASB issued a Proposed Accounting Standards Update which, among other changes, if approved would allow a company to elect to adopt ASU 2016-02 using a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of its retained earnings on the adoption date. ASU 2016-02 will require us to record a right to use asset and a lease liability for most of our leases, including our leases currently treated as operating leases. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and we will elect to apply certain practical expedients. We have not yet determined the effect of ASU 2016-02 on our ongoing financial reporting or quantified the impact\nto our balance sheet, however we do expect the right to use asset and lease liability recorded will be material. We do not expect to early adopt ASU 2016-02 and we anticipate adopting ASU 2016-02 using the cumulative effect method should this method be approved.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (\"ASU 2014-09\") which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, and also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. ASU 2014-09 is effective for us on January 1, 2018. Early application is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU 2014-09 permits the use of either the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. We will adopt ASU 2014-09 using the modified retrospective transition method on January 1, 2018 for those contracts that are not completed as of the date of the initial application. Under the modified retrospective method, the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. We will not early adopt ASU 2014-09.\nWe have not fully quantified the effect of adopting ASU 2014-09, however we anticipate the period for which we recognize revenue for fees billed in connection with customer installations will change and we be required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs. Revenues will be recognized over the contract term for installation fees associated with customer contracts with terms that are longer than month-to-month, which may be a shorter period than the average customer life currently used, because the fee does not give rise to a material right as defined by ASU 2014-09. Revenues will be recognized over the estimated average customer life for installation fees associated with month-to-month contracts, because the fee represents a material right. The impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on our total service revenue is not expected to be material. Additionally, we will be required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs, including commissions paid to our sales team and agents, and to amortize these costs over the period the services are transferred to the customer for commission paid to our sales team and over the remaining contract term for agent commissions. We currently expense these contract acquisition costs as incurred in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A). As a result our SG&A expense for 2018 under ASU 2014-09 will be less than our SG&A expense under our current accounting policy.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\". This guidance is intended to introduce a revised approach to the recognition and measurement of credit losses, emphasizing an updated model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. This new standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance may have on our financial statements and related disclosures.", "item_7_truncated": "On May 15, 2014, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the \"Merger Agreement\") by and among Cogent Communications Group, Inc.

Our focus is to add customers to our network in a way that maximizes its use and at the same time provides us with a profitable customer mix. We are responding to this opportunity by increasing our sales and marketing efforts including increasing our number of sales representatives and expanding our network to locations that we believe can be economically integrated and represent significant concentrations of Internet traffic. One of our keys to developing a profitable business will be to carefully match the cost of extending our network to reach new customers with the revenue expected to be generated by those customers. In addition, we may add customers to our network through strategic acquisitions.\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Percent\nChange </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Operating Data\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Revenue Per Unit (ARPU)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ARPU-on net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>506 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (7.8 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ARPU-off-net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,239 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3.5 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average price per megabit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1.11 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1.34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (17.4 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer Connections-end of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> On-net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61,334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Off-net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommon Stock Buyback Program\n(4)These amounts include amounts due under unconditional purchase obligations including dark fiber IRU operating and capital lease agreements entered into prior to December 31, 2017.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (\"ASU 2014-09\") which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, and also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. ASU 2014-09 is effective for us on January 1, 2018. Early application is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU 2014-09 permits the use of either the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. We will adopt ASU 2014-09 using the modified retrospective transition method on January 1, 2018 for those contracts that are not completed as of the date of the initial application. Under the modified retrospective method, the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. We will not early adopt ASU 2014-09.\nWe estimate our accruals for disputed leased circuit obligations based upon the nature and age of the dispute. Our network costs are impacted by the timing and amounts of disputed circuit costs. We generally record these disputed amounts when billed by the vendor and reverse these amounts when the vendor credit has been received or the dispute has otherwise been resolved.\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payments due by period </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 year </th> <th> </th> <th>1 - 3 years </th> <th> </th> <th>3 - 5 years </th> <th> </th> <th>After\n5 years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>702,933 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>599,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>335,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,907 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,719 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222,080 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,517 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,592 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,538 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unconditional purchase obligations(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,823 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,944 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,210,354 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>108,603 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>160,348 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>673,841 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>267,562 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(2)Includes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $10,162 and $10,931 for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWe may need to or elect to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity and we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to refinance any such indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may elect to secure additional capital in the future, at acceptable terms, to improve our liquidity or fund acquisitions or for general corporate purposes. In addition, in an effort to reduce future cash interest payments as well as future amounts due at maturity or to extend debt maturities, we may, from time to time, issue new debt, enter into debt for debt, or cash transactions to purchase our outstanding debt securities in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. We will evaluate any such transactions in light of the existing market conditions. The amounts involved in any such transaction, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.\nIn the second quarter of 2016, we paid $10.9 million for the purchase of $10.8 million of par value and accrued interest of our $200.0 million senior unsecured notes reducing the principal to $189.2 million and resulting in a loss of $0.2 million. The loss resulted from the write off of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the purchased notes. In June 2016, we elected to repay the outstanding $17.1 million principal balance of our installment payment agreement before its maturity date resulting in a loss of $0.4 million from the remaining unamortized discount.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated cash flows.\nOur off-net revenue increased 12.9% from 2015 to 2016. Our off-net customer connections increased 18.1% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Our off-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than our off-net revenue due to the 5.0% decrease in our off-net ARPU.\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>111,702 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>107,967 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>83,809 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45,801 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(45,234 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(35,471 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(97,267 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>8,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(128,847 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rates on cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,058 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(346 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,690 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents during the year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(27,308 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>70,728 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(84,199 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nissuance costs from issuing $175.0 million of our 2018 Notes.

The 2018 Notes sold in August 2013 were sold at 109.00% of par value. The resulting $5.9 million premium was being amortized as a reduction to interest expense to the maturity date using the effective interest rate method.

All foreign currency comparisons herein reflect results for 2017 translated at the average foreign currency exchange rates for 2016. For 2017 and 2016, on-net, off-net and non-core revenues represented 71.4%, 28.4% and 0.2% and 72.4%, 27.4% and 0.2% of our service revenue, respectively. Revenue recognition standards include guidance relating to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, gross receipts taxes, Universal Service Fund fees and certain state regulatory fees. We record these taxes billed to our customers on a gross basis (as service revenue and network operations expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. The impact of these taxes including the Universal Service Fund resulted in an increase of our revenues for 2017 of approximately $1.8 million.\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Percent\nChange </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Operating Data\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Revenue Per Unit (ARPU)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ARPU-on net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>548 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ARPU-off-net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,284 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5.0 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average price per megabit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1.34 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1.61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (16.8 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customer Connections-end of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> On-net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Off-net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt extinguishment, redemption and new debt issuances-$375.0 million senior secured notes\nnetwork.

We plan to continue to expand our network and to increase the number of on-net buildings we serve including multi-tenant office buildings, carrier neutral data centers and Cogent controlled data centers. Many factors can affect our ability to add buildings to our network. These factors include the willingness of building owners to grant us access rights, the availability of optical fiber networks to serve those buildings, the cost to connect buildings to our network and equipment availability.\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>December 31, 2017 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(Unaudited)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>62,857 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>62,857 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment from subsidiaries\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>214,591 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accumulated deficit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(151,780 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>62,857 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses.

Such charges may be presented gross or net based upon our accounting policy election. We record certain excise taxes and surcharges on a gross basis and includes them in our service revenue and cost of network operations.\nBuildings On-net. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 we had a total of 2,506 and 2,373 on-net buildings connected to our network, respectively.\ndeferred tax consequences represents management's best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in accounting estimates.\nWe recognize service revenue when the services are performed, evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable. Service discounts and incentives offered to certain customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue when granted. Fees billed in connection with customer installations are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of estimated customer life or contract term. We determine the estimated customer life using a historical analysis of customer retention and contract terms. If our estimated customer life and contract terms increase, we will recognize installation revenue over a longer period. We expense the direct costs associated with sales as incurred.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our income tax expense was $25.2 million for 2017 and $9.3 million for 2016. The increase in our income tax expense was primarily related to an increase in deferred income tax expense due to an increase in income before taxes in the United States and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\"). On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Act. The Act amended the Internal Revenue Code and reduced the corporate tax rate from a maximum rate of 35% to a flat 21% rate. The rate reduction is effective on January 1, 2018 and may reduce our future income taxes payable once we become a cash taxpayer in the United States. As a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate and other provisions under the Act, we were required to revalue our net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017 resulting in a reduction in our net deferred tax asset of $9.0 million and we recorded a transition tax of $2.3 million related to our foreign operations for a total income tax expense of approximately $11.3 million, which was recorded as additional noncash income tax expense in the three months and year ended December 31, 2017. The actual impact on our net deferred tax asset may vary from this amount from certain changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made and as further guidance related to the Act may be issued.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017.\nIn assessing our short term and long term liquidity, management reviews and analyzes our current cash balances, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, capital expenditure and operating expense commitments, and required capital lease, interest and debt payments and other obligations.\nsenior secured notes. In 2015 we received net proceeds of $248.6 million from the issuance of our $250.0 million senior secured notes. During 2016 we paid $10.9 million for the purchase of $10.8 million of par value and accrued interest of our $200.0 million senior unsecured notes and we elected to repay the outstanding $17.1 million principal balance of our installment payment agreement prior to its maturity date. Total installment payment agreement principal payments were $3.8 million, $21.2 million and $0.7 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDebt extinguishment, redemption and new debt issuance-$250.0 million. In March 2015, we redeemed our $240.0 million 8.375% senior notes due in 2018 at a redemption price of 104.188% of the $240.0 million principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest with the proceeds from our February 2015 issuance of $250.0 million of 5.375% senior secured notes and existing cash on hand. As a result of this transaction we incurred a loss on debt extinguishment and redemption of $10.1 million in 2015.\nThe payment of any future dividends and any other returns of capital, including stock buybacks, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be reduced, eliminated or increased and will be dependent upon our financial position, results of operations, available cash, cash flow, capital requirements, limitations under our debt indentures and other factors deemed relevant by the our Board of Directors. We are a Delaware Corporation and under the General Corporate Law of the State of Delaware distributions may be restricted including a restriction that distributions, including stock purchases and dividends, do not result in an impairment of a corporation's capital, as defined under Delaware Law. The indentures governing our notes limit our ability to return cash to our stockholders. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of limitations on distributions.\nIncome Taxes\nOur network is comprised of in-building riser facilities, metropolitan optical fiber networks, metropolitan traffic aggregation points and inter-city transport facilities. Our network is physically connected entirely through our facilities to 2,506 buildings in which we provide our on-net services, including 1,653 multi-tenant office buildings. We also provide on-net services in carrier-neutral data centers, Cogent controlled data centers and single-tenant office buildings. We operate 53 Cogent controlled data centers totaling 603,000 square feet. Because of our integrated network architecture, we are not dependent on local telephone companies or cable companies to serve our on-net customers. We emphasize the sale of our on-net services because we believe we have a competitive advantage in providing these services and these services generate gross profit margins that are greater than the gross profit margins of our off-net services.\nOur off-net revenue increased 12.7% from 2016 to 2017. Our off-net customer connections increased 15.8% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. Our off-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than our off-net revenue due to the 3.5% decrease in our off-net ARPU.\nGroup is obligor on our $189.2 million (originally $200.0 million) of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the \"2021 Notes\"). The 2021 Notes were sold in private offerings for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. Holdings provided a guarantee of the 2021 Notes but Holdings is not subject to the covenants under the indenture. In the second quarter of 2016, we paid $10.9 million for the purchase of $10.8 million of par value and accrued interest on our 2021 Notes reducing the principal amount to $189.2 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOur management reviews and analyzes several key financial measures in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and variability of our service revenue, operating results and cash flows. The following summary tables present a comparison of our results of operations with respect to certain key financial measures. The comparisons illustrated in the tables are discussed in greater detail below.\nWe have not fully quantified the effect of adopting ASU 2014-09, however we anticipate the period for which we recognize revenue for fees billed in connection with customer installations will change and we be required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs. Revenues will be recognized over the contract term for installation fees associated with customer contracts with terms that are longer than month-to-month, which may be a shorter period than the average customer life currently used, because the fee does not give rise to a material right as defined by ASU 2014-09. Revenues will be recognized over the estimated average customer life for installation fees associated with month-to-month contracts, because the fee represents a material right. The impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on our total service revenue is not expected to be material. Additionally, we will be required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs, including commissions paid to our sales team and agents, and to amortize these costs over the period the services are transferred to the customer for commission paid to our sales team and over the remaining contract term for agent commissions. We currently expense these contract acquisition costs as incurred in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A). As a result our SG&A expense for 2018 under ASU 2014-09 will be less than our SG&A expense under our current accounting policy.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nDividends on Common Stock\nAny future acquisitions or other significant unplanned costs or cash requirements in excess of amounts we currently hold may require that we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or our stockholders, or at all. Insufficient funds may require us to delay or scale back the number of buildings and markets that we add to our network, reduce our planned increase in our sales and marketing efforts, or require us to otherwise alter our business plan or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If issuing equity securities raises additional funds, substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result.\nto our balance sheet, however we do expect the right to use asset and lease liability recorded will be material. We do not expect to early adopt ASU 2016-02 and we anticipate adopting ASU 2016-02 using the cumulative effect method should this method be approved.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\"). Our SG&A expenses, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, increased 6.0% from 2016 to 2017. Non cash equity-based compensation expense is included in SG&A expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation and was $10.2 million for 2016 and $12.7 million for 2017. SG&A expenses increased primarily from an increase in salaries and related costs required to support our expansion and increases in our sales efforts and an increase in our headcount partly offset by a $2.0 million decrease in our legal fees primarily associated with U.S. net neutrality and interconnection regulatory matters and a $3.1 million charge related to a proposed settlement of a class action wage and hour claim for certain of our current and past sales reps that we incurred in 2016. Our sales force headcount increased by 5.9% from 542 at December 31, 2016 to 574 at December 31, 2017 and our total headcount increased by 4.7% from 887 at December 31, 2016 to 929 at December 31, 2017.\nNetwork Operations Expenses. Network operations expenses include the costs of personnel associated with service delivery, network management, and customer support, network facilities costs, fiber and equipment maintenance fees, leased circuit costs, and access and facilities fees paid to building owners. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense is included in network operations expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation. Our network operations expenses, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, increased 7.8% from 2016 to 2017. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in costs related to our network and facilities expansion activities and the increase in our off-net revenues. When we provide off-net services we also assume the cost of the associated tail-circuits.\nRevenue from our corporate and net-centric customers represented 62.3% and 37.7% of our service revenue, respectively, for 2017, and represented 60.4% and 39.6% of our service revenue, respectively, for 2016. Revenue from corporate customers increased 11.8% from $270.1 million for 2016 to $302.1 million for 2017 due to an increase in our number of corporate customers. Revenue from our net-centric customers increased by 3.6% from $176.8 million for 2016 to $183.1 million for 2017 primarily due to an increase in our number of net-centric customers, partially offset by a decline in our average price per megabit.\nWe estimate our litigation accruals based upon our estimate of the expected outcome after consultation with legal counsel. In the normal course of business we are involved in other legal activities and claims. Because such matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcomes are not predictable with assurance, the liability related to these legal actions and claims cannot be determined with certainty. In accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies, we accrue our estimate of a contingent liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and there is a range of expected loss for which no amount in the range is more likely than any other amount, we accrue at the low end of the range. We review our accruals at least quarterly and adjust them to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. Judgment is required in estimating the ultimate outcome of any dispute resolution process, as well as any other amounts that may be incurred to conclude the negotiations or settle any litigation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with \"Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data\" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. The discussion in this report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applying to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" as well as those discussed elsewhere. You should read \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to:\nGains on Equipment Transactions. We exchanged certain used network equipment and cash consideration for new network equipment resulting in gains of $5.4 million for 2015 and $7.7 million for 2016. The gains are based upon the excess of the estimated fair value of the new network equipment over the carrying amount of the returned used network equipment and the cash paid.\nSummarized Financial Information of Holdings\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInterest Expense. Interest expense results from interest incurred on our $375.0 million of senior secured notes, interest incurred on our $189.2 million of senior unsecured notes, interest on our installment payment agreement and interest on our capital lease obligations. Our interest expense increased by 18.8% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to our issuance of $125.0 million of senior secured notes in December 2016. In the second quarter of 2016, we paid $10.9 million for the purchase of $10.8 million of par value and accrued interest of our $200.0 million senior unsecured notes reducing the principal to $189.2 million and resulting in a loss of $0.2 million. The loss resulted from the write off of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the purchased notes. In June 2016, we elected to repay the outstanding $17.1 million principal balance of the installment payment agreement before its maturity date resulting in a loss of $0.4 million from the remaining unamortized discount.\nOur Board of Directors has approved through December 31, 2018, purchases of our common stock under a buyback program (the \"Buyback Program\"). We purchased 0.1 million shares of our common stock for $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, 0.1 million shares of our common stock for $4.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 1.2 million shares of our common stock for $39.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2017 there was a total of $41.5 million available under the Buyback Program.\nIn July 2015, we settled a dispute for the payment of the remaining balances for certain IRU capital lease obligations with a vendor. The IRU assets were fully depreciated in 2012 when the related fiber was replaced and was no longer used by us. The difference between the remaining net present value of the related IRU capital lease obligation and the settlement liability was recorded as a gain on lease obligations of $1.5 million.\nThe 2022 Notes were sold in private offerings for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A and mature on March 1, 2022. Interest accrues at 5.375% and is paid semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The net proceeds from the February 2015 offering were $248.6 million and the net proceeds were $124.3 million from the December 2016 offering after deducting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nThe growth in Internet traffic has a more significant impact on our net-centric customers who represent the vast majority of the traffic on our network and who tend to consume the majority of their allocated bandwidth on their connections. Net-centric customers tend to purchase their service on a price per megabit basis. Our corporate customers tend to utilize a small portion of their allocated bandwidth on their connections and tend to purchase their service on a per connection basis.\nDue to our strategic acquisitions of network assets and equipment, we believe we are well positioned to grow our revenue base. We continue to purchase and deploy network equipment to parts of our network to maximize the utilization of our assets and to expand and increase the capacity of our\nNM-Not meaningful\nWe are a facilities-based provider of low-cost, high-speed Internet access, private network services and data center colocation space. Our network is specifically designed and optimized to transmit packet-switched data using IP. We deliver our services primarily to small and medium-sized businesses, communications service providers and other bandwidth-intensive organizations in North America, Europe and in Asia.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (\"ASU 2016-02\"). ASU 2016-02 will replace most existing lease accounting guidance when it becomes effective. ASU 2016-02 is effective for us beginning on January 1, 2019. Early application is permitted. ASU 2016-02 currently must be adopted using the modified retrospective approach for all leases that exist at or commence after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented (with the option to apply certain practical expedients), which for us will be the period beginning January 1, 2017. However, in January 2018 the FASB issued a Proposed Accounting Standards Update which, among other changes, if approved would allow a company to elect to adopt ASU 2016-02 using a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of its retained earnings on the adoption date. ASU 2016-02 will require us to record a right to use asset and a lease liability for most of our leases, including our leases currently treated as operating leases. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and we will elect to apply certain practical expedients. We have not yet determined the effect of ASU 2016-02 on our ongoing financial reporting or quantified the impact\nService Revenue. Our service revenue increased 10.6% from 2015 to 2016. Exchange rates negatively impacted our increase in service revenue by approximately $0.9 million. All foreign currency comparisons herein reflect results for 2016 translated at the average foreign currency exchange rates for 2015. For 2016 and 2015, on-net, off-net and non-core revenues represented 72.4%, 27.4% and 0.2% and 72.9%, 26.8% and 0.3% of our service revenue, respectively. Revenue recognition standards include guidance relating to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, gross receipts taxes, Universal Service Fund fees and certain state regulatory fees. We record these taxes\nNet Cash Provided By Operating Activities. Our primary source of operating cash is receipts from our customers who are billed on a monthly basis for our services. Our primary uses of operating cash are payments made to our vendors, employees and interest payments made to our capital lease vendors and our note holders. Our changes in cash provided by operating activities are primarily due to changes in our operating profit and changes in our interest payments. Cash provided by operating activities for 2017, 2016 and 2015 includes interest payments on our note obligations of $30.8 million, $24.5 million and $29.3 million, respectively.\n\n(1)Includes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $573 and $584 for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe indentures governing our 2022 and 2021 Notes, among other things, limit our ability to incur indebtedness; to pay dividends or make other distributions; to make certain investments and other restricted payments; to create liens; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; to incur restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends or make other payments; and to enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. Limitations on the ability to incur additional indebtedness (excluding IRU agreements incurred in the normal course of business) include a restriction on incurring additional indebtedness if our consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the indentures, is greater than 5.0. The indentures prohibit certain payments, such as dividends and stock purchases, when our consolidated leverage ratio, as defined by the indentures, is greater than 4.25. The unrestricted payment amount may be increased by our consolidated cash flow, as defined in the indentures, as long as our consolidated leverage ratio is less than 4.25. Our consolidated leverage ratio is currently above 4.25 as of December 31, 2017, and we have a total of $64.3 million that is permitted for investment payments including dividends and stock purchases.\nGains on Equipment Transactions. We exchanged certain used network equipment and cash consideration for new network equipment resulting in gains of $7.7 million for 2016 and $3.9 million for 2017. The gains are based upon the excess of the estimated fair value of the new network equipment over the carrying amount of the returned used network equipment and the cash paid.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our income tax expense was $9.3 million for 2016 and $7.8 million for 2015. The increase in our income tax expense was primarily related to an increase in deferred income tax expense due to an increase in income before taxes in the United States.\n\nThe accounting policies we believe to be most critical to understanding our financial results and condition or that require complex, significant and subjective management judgments are discussed below.\nWe are a facilities-based provider of Internet access and communications services. Facilities-based providers require significant physical assets, or network facilities, to provide their services. Typically when a facilities-based network services provider begins providing its services in a new jurisdiction losses are incurred for several years until economies of scale have been achieved. Our foreign operations are in Europe, Canada, Mexico and Asia. Europe accounts for roughly 75% of our foreign operations. Our European operations have incurred losses and will continue to do so until our European customer base and revenues have grown enough to achieve sufficient economies of scale.\n(3)These amounts include amounts due under our operating leases.\n\nSenior secured notes-$240.0 million\nOur on-net revenue increased 7.1% from 2016 to 2017. We increased the number of our on-net customer connections by 16.0% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. On-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than on-net revenues primarily due to the 7.8% decline in our on-net ARPU, primarily from a decline in ARPU for our net centric customers. ARPU is determined by dividing revenue for the period by the average customer connections for that period. Our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers is determined by dividing the aggregate monthly recurring fixed charges for those customers by the aggregate committed data rate for the same customers. The decline in on-net ARPU is partly attributed to volume and term based pricing discounts. Additionally, on-net customers who cancel their service from our installed base of customers, in general, have an ARPU that is greater than the ARPU for our new customers due to declining prices primarily for our on-net services sold to our net-centric customers. These trends resulted in the reduction to our on-net ARPU and a 17.4% decline in our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers.\nWe record assets and liabilities under capital leases at the lesser of the present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the assets under lease. We establish the number of renewal option periods used in determining the lease term, if any, based upon our assessment at the inception of the lease of the number of option periods for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in such amount that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. Useful lives are determined based on historical usage with consideration given to technological changes and trends in the industry that could impact the asset utilization. We estimate the fair value of leased assets primarily using estimated replacement cost data for similar assets.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in the United States limits the utilization of net operating losses when ownership changes, as defined by that section, occur. We have performed an analysis of our Section 382 ownership changes and have determined that the utilization of certain of our net operating loss carryforwards in the United States is limited.\nCapital Lease Obligations\nOur on-net revenue increased 9.8% from 2015 to 2016. We increased the number of our on-net customer connections by 16.3% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. On-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than on-net revenues primarily due to the 4.9% decline in our on-net ARPU, primarily from a decline in ARPU for our net centric customers. ARPU is determined by dividing revenue for the period by the average customer connections for that period. Our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers is determined by dividing the aggregate monthly recurring fixed charges for those customers by the aggregate committed data rate for the same customers. The decline in on-net ARPU is partly attributed to volume and term based pricing discounts. Additionally, on-net customers who cancel their service from our installed base of customers, in general, have an ARPU that is greater than the ARPU for our new customers due to declining prices primarily for our on-net services sold to our net-centric customers. These trends resulted in the reduction to our on-net ARPU and a 16.8% decline in our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers.\nOur on-net service consists of high-speed Internet access and private network services at speeds ranging from 100 Megabits per second to 100 Gigabits per second. We offer our on-net services to customers located in buildings that are physically connected to our network. We provide on-net Internet access and private network services to corporate customers and net-centric customers. Our corporate customers are located in multi-tenant office buildings and in our data centers and typically include law firms, financial services firms, advertising and marketing firms and other professional services businesses. Our net-centric customers include bandwidth-intensive users such as other Internet access providers, telephone companies, cable television companies, web hosting companies, content delivery networks and commercial content and application service providers. These net-centric customers generally receive our services in colocation facilities and in our data centers.\nOur non-core revenue decreased 12.8% from 2016 to 2017. We do not actively market these acquired non-core services and expect that the service revenue associated with them will continue to decline.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements-to be Adopted\n\nBuildings On-net. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 we had a total of 2,373 and 2,251 on-net buildings connected to our network, respectively.\nGains on capital lease terminations. In March 2015 we elected to terminate certain IRU capital lease obligations with a vendor. Under our estimate of the termination provisions of the related contract we recorded an estimated termination liability of $8.1 million in March 2015. The difference between the remaining net present value of the related IRU capital leases, the remaining net book value of the IRU assets and the termination liability and amounts due through the termination date was recorded as a gain on capital lease termination of $10.1 million in 2015.\n(1)These amounts include interest and principal payment obligations on our $375.0 million of 2022 Notes through the maturity date of March 1, 2022 and interest and principal payments on our $189.2 million of 2021 Notes through the maturity date of April 15, 2021 and $10.7 million due under an installment payment agreement with a vendor.\nRevenue from our corporate and net-centric customers represented 60.4% and 39.6% of our service revenue, respectively, for 2016, and represented 58.3% and 41.7% of our service revenue, respectively, for 2015. Revenue from corporate customers increased 14.7% from $235.5 million for 2015 to $270.1 million for 2016 due to an increase in our number of corporate customers. Revenue from our net-centric customers increased by 4.8% from $168.7 million for 2015 to $176.8 million for 2016 primarily due to an increase in our number of net-centric customers, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and a decline in our average price per megabit.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur total indebtedness, at par, at December 31, 2017 was $732.5 million. Our total indebtedness at December 31, 2017 includes $157.5 million of capital lease obligations for dark fiber primarily under 15-20 year IRUs. Our total cash and cash equivalents were $247.0 million at December 31, 2017.\n(2)Includes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $12,686 and $10,162 for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nNet Cash Used In Investing Activities. Our primary use of investing cash is for purchases of property and equipment. These amounts were $45.8 million, $45.2 million and $35.6 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The annual changes in purchases of property and equipment are primarily due to the timing and scope of our network expansion activities including geographic expansion and adding buildings to our network. In 2017, 2016 and 2015 we obtained $9.0 million, $5.5 million and $21.9 million, respectively, of network equipment and software in non-cash exchanges for notes payable under an installment payment agreement.\nFuture Capital Requirements\nOur off-net services are sold to businesses that are connected to our network primarily by means of \"last mile\" access service lines obtained from other carriers, primarily in the form of metropolitan Ethernet circuits. Our non-core services, which consist primarily of legacy services of companies whose assets or businesses we have acquired. We do not actively market these non-core services and expect the service revenue associated with them to continue to decline.\nOur non-core revenue decreased 6.6% from 2015 to 2016. We do not actively market these acquired non-core services and expect that the service revenue associated with them will continue to decline.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense results from interest incurred on our $125.0 million of senior secured notes that we issued on December 2, 2016, $250.0 million of senior secured notes that we issued on February 20, 2015, $200.0 million of senior unsecured notes that we issued on April 9, 2014, $240.0 million of senior secured notes that we issued in August 2013 and January 2011 and redeemed in March 2015, interest on our installment payment agreement and interest on our capital lease obligations. Our interest expense decreased by 1.2% primarily due to the March 2015 redemption of our $240 million of 8.375% senior secured notes that carried a higher interest rate than our $250.0 million of 5.375% senior secured notes that we issued in February 2015. Additionally, in March 2015 we elected to terminate $29.9 million of capital lease obligations in Spain with a vendor reducing our interest expense on our capital leases.\n\nOur management reviews and analyzes several key financial measures in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and variability of our service revenue, operating results and cash flows. The following summary tables present a comparison of our results of operations with respect to certain key financial measures. The comparisons illustrated in the tables are discussed in greater detail below.\nWe do not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.\nFuture economic instability in the global economy, which could affect spending on Internet services; the impact of changing foreign exchange rates (in particular the Euro to US dollar and Canadian dollar to US dollar exchange rates) on the translation of our non-US dollar denominated revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities; legal and operational difficulties in new markets; the imposition of a requirement that we contribute to the United States Universal Service Fund on the basis of our Internet revenue; changes in government policy and/or regulation, including rules regarding data protection, cyber security and net neutrality; increasing competition leading to lower prices for our services; our ability to attract new customers and to increase and maintain the volume of traffic on our network; the ability to maintain our Internet peering arrangements on favorable terms; our ability to renew our long-term leases of optical fiber that comprise our network; our reliance on an equipment vendor, Cisco Systems Inc., and the potential for hardware or software problems associated with such equipment; the dependence of our network on the quality and dependability of third-party fiber providers; our ability to retain certain customers that comprise a significant portion of our revenue base; the management of network failures and/or disruptions; and outcomes in litigation as well as other risks discussed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, this annual report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022 Our valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset reflects the uncertainty surrounding the realization of our net operating loss carry-forwards and our other deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are established when management determines it is \"more likely than not\" that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. At each balance sheet date, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. We consider all available positive and negative evidence, on a jurisdictional basis, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance including our operating results, ongoing tax planning, and our forecast of future taxable income. We base our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws, rates and interpretations, and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. We develop our estimates of future profitability based on our historical data and experience and our judgment and expectations. Changes in existing tax laws and rates, their related interpretations, and the uncertainty generated by the current economic environment may affect the amounts of our deferred tax liabilities or the valuations of our deferred tax assets overtime. Significant judgment is required with respect to the determination of whether a valuation allowance is required for certain of our deferred tax assets. Our accounting for\nResults of Operations\nRevenue Recognition\nLimitations under the indentures\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\"). Our SG&A expenses, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, increased 6.7% from 2015 to 2016. Non cash equity-based compensation expense is included in SG&A expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation and was $10.9 million for 2015 and $10.2 million for 2016. SG&A expenses increased primarily from an increase in salaries and related costs required to support our expansion and increases in our sales efforts, an increase in our headcount and a $3.1 million charge related to a proposed settlement of a class action wage and hour claim for certain of our current and past sales reps, partly offset by a $0.5 million decrease in our legal fees primarily associated with U.S.\nGeneral Overview\nbilled to our customers on a gross basis (as service revenue and network operations expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. The impact of these taxes including the Universal Service Fund resulted in an increase of our revenues for 2016 of approximately $5.5 million.\nWe believe that our cash on hand and cash generated from our operating activities will be adequate to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service, dividend payments and other cash requirements for the next twelve months if we execute our business plan.\nWe have established allowances associated with uncollectible accounts receivable and certain of our deferred tax assets.\nWe believe some of the most important trends in our industry are the continued long-term growth in Internet traffic and a decline in Internet access prices on a per megabit basis. The effective price per megabit for our corporate customers is declining as the bandwidth utilization and connection size of our corporate customer connections increases. As Internet traffic continues to grow and prices per unit of traffic continue to decline, we believe we can continue to load our network and gain market share from less efficient network operators. However, continued erosion in Internet access prices will likely have a negative impact on the rate at which we can increase our revenues and our profitability. Our revenue may also be negatively affected if we are unable to grow our Internet traffic or if the rate of growth of Internet traffic does not offset an expected decline in our per unit pricing. We do not know if Internet traffic will increase or decrease, or the rate at which it will increase or decrease. Changes in Internet traffic will be a function of the number of Internet users, the amount of time users spend on the Internet, the applications for which the Internet is used, the bandwidth intensity of these applications and the pricing of Internet services, and other factors.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses. Our depreciation and amortization expenses increased 0.9% from 2016 to 2017. The increase is primarily due to the depreciation expense associated with the increase related to newly deployed fixed assets more than offsetting the decline in depreciation expense from fully depreciated fixed assets.\nIndebtedness\n\u2022 Our valuation allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is designed to account for the expense associated with accounts receivable that we estimate will not be collected. We assess the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating general factors, such as the length of time individual receivables are past due, historical collection experience, and changes in the credit-worthiness of our customers. We also assess the ability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to us and establish specific allowances based on the amount we expect to collect from these customers. If circumstances relating to specific customers change or economic conditions change such that our past collections experience and assessment of the economic environment are no longer appropriate, our estimate of the recoverability of our trade receivables could be impacted.\n(2)The capital lease obligations above were incurred in connection with IRUs for inter-city and intra-city dark fiber underlying substantial portions of our network. These capital leases are presented on our balance sheet at the net present value of the future minimum lease payments, or $157.5 million at December 31, 2017. These leases generally have initial terms of 15 to 20 years\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\". This guidance is intended to introduce a revised approach to the recognition and measurement of credit losses, emphasizing an updated model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. This new standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance may have on our financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nNetwork Operations Expenses. Network operations expenses include the costs of personnel associated with service delivery, network management, and customer support, network facilities costs, fiber and equipment maintenance fees, leased circuit costs, and access and facilities fees paid to building owners. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense is included in network operations expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation. Our network operations expenses, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, increased 11.2% from 2015 to 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in costs related to our network and facilities expansion activities, a $5.5 million increase in excise taxes billed to our customers recorded on a gross basis (in service revenue and cost of network operations expense) and the increase in our off-net revenues. When we provide off-net services we also assume the cost of the associated tail-circuits.\n\nValuation Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Receivable and Deferred Tax Assets\nIn March 2015, Group redeemed its $240.0 million 8.375% senior notes due in 2018 (the \"2018 Notes\") with the proceeds from its February 2015 issuance of $250.0 million of 5.375% senior secured notes (the \"2022 Notes\") and existing cash on hand. In February 2015 we deposited $251.6 million with the trustee for the benefit of the holders of the 2018 Notes in order to redeem on March 12, 2015 the entire outstanding amount of 2018 Notes at a redemption price of 104.188% of the $240.0 million principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a result of this transaction we incurred a loss on debt extinguishment and redemption of $10.1 million. In December 2016, we issued an additional $125.0 million of our 2022 Notes at a premium of 100.365%.\nNet Cash (Used In) Provided By Financing Activities. Our primary uses of cash for financing activities are for dividend payments, stock purchases and principal payments under our capital lease obligations. In 2015 we redeemed our $240.0 million senior secured notes for a payment of $251.3 million. Amounts paid under our stock buyback program were $1.8 million for 2017, $4.5 million for 2016 and $39.4 million for 2015. During 2017, 2016 and 2015 we paid $81.7 million, $68.2 million and $66.3 million, respectively, for our quarterly dividend payments. Our quarterly dividend payments have increased due to regular quarterly increases in our quarterly dividend per share amounts. Principal payments under our capital lease obligations were $11.2 million, $12.5 million and $20.2 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are impacted by the timing and extent of our network expansion activities. Our financing activities also include proceeds from and repayments of our debt offerings. In December 2016 we received net proceeds of $124.3 million from the issuance of our $125.0 million of", "item_7_text": "On May 15, 2014, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the \"Merger Agreement\") by and among Cogent Communications Group, Inc. (\"Group\"), a Delaware corporation, Cogent Communications Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"Holdings\") and Cogent Communications Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"Merger Sub\"), Group adopted a new holding company organizational structure whereby Group is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings. Holdings is a \"successor issuer\" to Group pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\").\nDividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. Dividends on unvested restricted shares of common stock are paid as the awards vest. Our initial quarterly dividend payment was made in the third quarter of 2012. On February 21, 2018, our Board of Directors approved the payment of our quarterly dividend of $0.50 per common share. The dividend for the first quarter of 2018 will be paid to holders of record on March 9, 2018. This estimated $22.4 million dividend payment is expected to be made on March 26, 2018.\nHoldings is a guarantor under the 2021 and 2022 Notes. Under the indentures we are required to disclose financial information of Holdings including its assets, liabilities and its operating results (\"Holdings Financial Information\"). The Holdings Financial Information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 is detailed below (in thousands).\nIn January 2011 and in August 2013, we issued our 2018 Notes for aggregate principal amounts of $175.0 million and $65.0 million, respectively, in private offerings for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. The 2018 Notes were secured and bore interest at 8.375% per annum. Interest was payable in cash semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15, of each year. In January 2011, we received net proceeds of $170.5 million after deducting $4.5 million of\nWe believe our key growth opportunity is provided by our high-capacity network, which provides us with the ability to add a significant number of customers to our network with minimal direct incremental costs. Our focus is to add customers to our network in a way that maximizes its use and at the same time provides us with a profitable customer mix. We are responding to this opportunity by increasing our sales and marketing efforts including increasing our number of sales representatives and expanding our network to locations that we believe can be economically integrated and represent significant concentrations of Internet traffic. One of our keys to developing a profitable business will be to carefully match the cost of extending our network to reach new customers with the revenue expected to be generated by those customers. In addition, we may add customers to our network through strategic acquisitions.\nCommon Stock Buyback Program\n(4)These amounts include amounts due under unconditional purchase obligations including dark fiber IRU operating and capital lease agreements entered into prior to December 31, 2017.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (\"ASU 2014-09\") which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, and also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. ASU 2014-09 is effective for us on January 1, 2018. Early application is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU 2014-09 permits the use of either the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. We will adopt ASU 2014-09 using the modified retrospective transition method on January 1, 2018 for those contracts that are not completed as of the date of the initial application. Under the modified retrospective method, the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. We will not early adopt ASU 2014-09.\nWe estimate our accruals for disputed leased circuit obligations based upon the nature and age of the dispute. Our network costs are impacted by the timing and amounts of disputed circuit costs. We generally record these disputed amounts when billed by the vendor and reverse these amounts when the vendor credit has been received or the dispute has otherwise been resolved.\n(2)Includes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $10,162 and $10,931 for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWe may need to or elect to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity and we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to refinance any such indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may elect to secure additional capital in the future, at acceptable terms, to improve our liquidity or fund acquisitions or for general corporate purposes. In addition, in an effort to reduce future cash interest payments as well as future amounts due at maturity or to extend debt maturities, we may, from time to time, issue new debt, enter into debt for debt, or cash transactions to purchase our outstanding debt securities in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. We will evaluate any such transactions in light of the existing market conditions. The amounts involved in any such transaction, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.\nIn the second quarter of 2016, we paid $10.9 million for the purchase of $10.8 million of par value and accrued interest of our $200.0 million senior unsecured notes reducing the principal to $189.2 million and resulting in a loss of $0.2 million. The loss resulted from the write off of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the purchased notes. In June 2016, we elected to repay the outstanding $17.1 million principal balance of our installment payment agreement before its maturity date resulting in a loss of $0.4 million from the remaining unamortized discount.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated cash flows.\nOur off-net revenue increased 12.9% from 2015 to 2016. Our off-net customer connections increased 18.1% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Our off-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than our off-net revenue due to the 5.0% decrease in our off-net ARPU.\nissuance costs from issuing $175.0 million of our 2018 Notes. In August 2013, we received net proceeds of approximately $69.9 million after deducting $1.0 million of issuance costs from issuing $65.0 million of 2018 Notes. The 2018 Notes sold in August 2013 were sold at 109.00% of par value. The resulting $5.9 million premium was being amortized as a reduction to interest expense to the maturity date using the effective interest rate method. In March 2015, the 2018 Notes were extinguished and redeemed with the proceeds of our issuance of our $250.0 million of 2022 Notes and cash on hand.\n\nNM-Not meaningful\nAccruals for Contingencies\nService Revenue. Our service revenue increased 8.6% from 2016 to 2017. Exchange rates positively impacted our increase in service revenue by approximately $1.9 million. All foreign currency comparisons herein reflect results for 2017 translated at the average foreign currency exchange rates for 2016. For 2017 and 2016, on-net, off-net and non-core revenues represented 71.4%, 28.4% and 0.2% and 72.4%, 27.4% and 0.2% of our service revenue, respectively. Revenue recognition standards include guidance relating to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, gross receipts taxes, Universal Service Fund fees and certain state regulatory fees. We record these taxes billed to our customers on a gross basis (as service revenue and network operations expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. The impact of these taxes including the Universal Service Fund resulted in an increase of our revenues for 2017 of approximately $1.8 million.\nDebt extinguishment, redemption and new debt issuances-$375.0 million senior secured notes\nnetwork. Our future capital expenditures will be based primarily on the expansion of our network and the addition of on-net buildings. We plan to continue to expand our network and to increase the number of on-net buildings we serve including multi-tenant office buildings, carrier neutral data centers and Cogent controlled data centers. Many factors can affect our ability to add buildings to our network. These factors include the willingness of building owners to grant us access rights, the availability of optical fiber networks to serve those buildings, the cost to connect buildings to our network and equipment availability.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses. Our depreciation and amortization expenses increased 6.7% from 2015 to 2016. The increase is primarily due to the depreciation expense associated with the increase related to newly deployed fixed assets more than offsetting the decline in depreciation expense from fully depreciated fixed assets.\n(1)Includes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $604 and $573 for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nnet neutrality and interconnection regulatory matters. Our sales force headcount increased by 9.5% from 495 at December 31, 2015 to 542 at December 31, 2016 and our total headcount increased by 7.1% from 828 at December 31, 2015 to 887 at December 31, 2016.\nSenior unsecured notes-$189.2 million\nRevenue recognition standards include guidance relating to taxes or surcharges assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but are not limited to, gross receipts taxes, excise taxes, Universal Service Fund fees and certain state regulatory fees. Such charges may be presented gross or net based upon our accounting policy election. We record certain excise taxes and surcharges on a gross basis and includes them in our service revenue and cost of network operations.\nBuildings On-net. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 we had a total of 2,506 and 2,373 on-net buildings connected to our network, respectively.\ndeferred tax consequences represents management's best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in accounting estimates.\nWe recognize service revenue when the services are performed, evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable. Service discounts and incentives offered to certain customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue when granted. Fees billed in connection with customer installations are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of estimated customer life or contract term. We determine the estimated customer life using a historical analysis of customer retention and contract terms. If our estimated customer life and contract terms increase, we will recognize installation revenue over a longer period. We expense the direct costs associated with sales as incurred.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our income tax expense was $25.2 million for 2017 and $9.3 million for 2016. The increase in our income tax expense was primarily related to an increase in deferred income tax expense due to an increase in income before taxes in the United States and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\"). On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Act. The Act amended the Internal Revenue Code and reduced the corporate tax rate from a maximum rate of 35% to a flat 21% rate. The rate reduction is effective on January 1, 2018 and may reduce our future income taxes payable once we become a cash taxpayer in the United States. As a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate and other provisions under the Act, we were required to revalue our net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017 resulting in a reduction in our net deferred tax asset of $9.0 million and we recorded a transition tax of $2.3 million related to our foreign operations for a total income tax expense of approximately $11.3 million, which was recorded as additional noncash income tax expense in the three months and year ended December 31, 2017. The actual impact on our net deferred tax asset may vary from this amount from certain changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made and as further guidance related to the Act may be issued.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017.\nIn assessing our short term and long term liquidity, management reviews and analyzes our current cash balances, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, capital expenditure and operating expense commitments, and required capital lease, interest and debt payments and other obligations.\nsenior secured notes. In 2015 we received net proceeds of $248.6 million from the issuance of our $250.0 million senior secured notes. During 2016 we paid $10.9 million for the purchase of $10.8 million of par value and accrued interest of our $200.0 million senior unsecured notes and we elected to repay the outstanding $17.1 million principal balance of our installment payment agreement prior to its maturity date. Total installment payment agreement principal payments were $3.8 million, $21.2 million and $0.7 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDebt extinguishment, redemption and new debt issuance-$250.0 million. In March 2015, we redeemed our $240.0 million 8.375% senior notes due in 2018 at a redemption price of 104.188% of the $240.0 million principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest with the proceeds from our February 2015 issuance of $250.0 million of 5.375% senior secured notes and existing cash on hand. As a result of this transaction we incurred a loss on debt extinguishment and redemption of $10.1 million in 2015.\nThe payment of any future dividends and any other returns of capital, including stock buybacks, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be reduced, eliminated or increased and will be dependent upon our financial position, results of operations, available cash, cash flow, capital requirements, limitations under our debt indentures and other factors deemed relevant by the our Board of Directors. We are a Delaware Corporation and under the General Corporate Law of the State of Delaware distributions may be restricted including a restriction that distributions, including stock purchases and dividends, do not result in an impairment of a corporation's capital, as defined under Delaware Law. The indentures governing our notes limit our ability to return cash to our stockholders. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of limitations on distributions.\nIncome Taxes\nOur network is comprised of in-building riser facilities, metropolitan optical fiber networks, metropolitan traffic aggregation points and inter-city transport facilities. Our network is physically connected entirely through our facilities to 2,506 buildings in which we provide our on-net services, including 1,653 multi-tenant office buildings. We also provide on-net services in carrier-neutral data centers, Cogent controlled data centers and single-tenant office buildings. We operate 53 Cogent controlled data centers totaling 603,000 square feet. Because of our integrated network architecture, we are not dependent on local telephone companies or cable companies to serve our on-net customers. We emphasize the sale of our on-net services because we believe we have a competitive advantage in providing these services and these services generate gross profit margins that are greater than the gross profit margins of our off-net services.\nOur off-net revenue increased 12.7% from 2016 to 2017. Our off-net customer connections increased 15.8% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. Our off-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than our off-net revenue due to the 3.5% decrease in our off-net ARPU.\nGroup is obligor on our $189.2 million (originally $200.0 million) of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the \"2021 Notes\"). The 2021 Notes were sold in private offerings for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. Holdings provided a guarantee of the 2021 Notes but Holdings is not subject to the covenants under the indenture. In the second quarter of 2016, we paid $10.9 million for the purchase of $10.8 million of par value and accrued interest on our 2021 Notes reducing the principal amount to $189.2 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOur management reviews and analyzes several key financial measures in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and variability of our service revenue, operating results and cash flows. The following summary tables present a comparison of our results of operations with respect to certain key financial measures. The comparisons illustrated in the tables are discussed in greater detail below.\nWe have not fully quantified the effect of adopting ASU 2014-09, however we anticipate the period for which we recognize revenue for fees billed in connection with customer installations will change and we be required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs. Revenues will be recognized over the contract term for installation fees associated with customer contracts with terms that are longer than month-to-month, which may be a shorter period than the average customer life currently used, because the fee does not give rise to a material right as defined by ASU 2014-09. Revenues will be recognized over the estimated average customer life for installation fees associated with month-to-month contracts, because the fee represents a material right. The impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on our total service revenue is not expected to be material. Additionally, we will be required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs, including commissions paid to our sales team and agents, and to amortize these costs over the period the services are transferred to the customer for commission paid to our sales team and over the remaining contract term for agent commissions. We currently expense these contract acquisition costs as incurred in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A). As a result our SG&A expense for 2018 under ASU 2014-09 will be less than our SG&A expense under our current accounting policy.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nDividends on Common Stock\nAny future acquisitions or other significant unplanned costs or cash requirements in excess of amounts we currently hold may require that we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or our stockholders, or at all. Insufficient funds may require us to delay or scale back the number of buildings and markets that we add to our network, reduce our planned increase in our sales and marketing efforts, or require us to otherwise alter our business plan or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If issuing equity securities raises additional funds, substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result.\nto our balance sheet, however we do expect the right to use asset and lease liability recorded will be material. We do not expect to early adopt ASU 2016-02 and we anticipate adopting ASU 2016-02 using the cumulative effect method should this method be approved.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\"). Our SG&A expenses, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, increased 6.0% from 2016 to 2017. Non cash equity-based compensation expense is included in SG&A expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation and was $10.2 million for 2016 and $12.7 million for 2017. SG&A expenses increased primarily from an increase in salaries and related costs required to support our expansion and increases in our sales efforts and an increase in our headcount partly offset by a $2.0 million decrease in our legal fees primarily associated with U.S. net neutrality and interconnection regulatory matters and a $3.1 million charge related to a proposed settlement of a class action wage and hour claim for certain of our current and past sales reps that we incurred in 2016. Our sales force headcount increased by 5.9% from 542 at December 31, 2016 to 574 at December 31, 2017 and our total headcount increased by 4.7% from 887 at December 31, 2016 to 929 at December 31, 2017.\nNetwork Operations Expenses. Network operations expenses include the costs of personnel associated with service delivery, network management, and customer support, network facilities costs, fiber and equipment maintenance fees, leased circuit costs, and access and facilities fees paid to building owners. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense is included in network operations expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation. Our network operations expenses, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, increased 7.8% from 2016 to 2017. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in costs related to our network and facilities expansion activities and the increase in our off-net revenues. When we provide off-net services we also assume the cost of the associated tail-circuits.\nRevenue from our corporate and net-centric customers represented 62.3% and 37.7% of our service revenue, respectively, for 2017, and represented 60.4% and 39.6% of our service revenue, respectively, for 2016. Revenue from corporate customers increased 11.8% from $270.1 million for 2016 to $302.1 million for 2017 due to an increase in our number of corporate customers. Revenue from our net-centric customers increased by 3.6% from $176.8 million for 2016 to $183.1 million for 2017 primarily due to an increase in our number of net-centric customers, partially offset by a decline in our average price per megabit.\nWe estimate our litigation accruals based upon our estimate of the expected outcome after consultation with legal counsel. In the normal course of business we are involved in other legal activities and claims. Because such matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcomes are not predictable with assurance, the liability related to these legal actions and claims cannot be determined with certainty. In accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies, we accrue our estimate of a contingent liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and there is a range of expected loss for which no amount in the range is more likely than any other amount, we accrue at the low end of the range. We review our accruals at least quarterly and adjust them to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. Judgment is required in estimating the ultimate outcome of any dispute resolution process, as well as any other amounts that may be incurred to conclude the negotiations or settle any litigation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with \"Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data\" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. The discussion in this report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applying to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" as well as those discussed elsewhere. You should read \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to:\nGains on Equipment Transactions. We exchanged certain used network equipment and cash consideration for new network equipment resulting in gains of $5.4 million for 2015 and $7.7 million for 2016. The gains are based upon the excess of the estimated fair value of the new network equipment over the carrying amount of the returned used network equipment and the cash paid.\nSummarized Financial Information of Holdings\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInterest Expense. Interest expense results from interest incurred on our $375.0 million of senior secured notes, interest incurred on our $189.2 million of senior unsecured notes, interest on our installment payment agreement and interest on our capital lease obligations. Our interest expense increased by 18.8% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to our issuance of $125.0 million of senior secured notes in December 2016. In the second quarter of 2016, we paid $10.9 million for the purchase of $10.8 million of par value and accrued interest of our $200.0 million senior unsecured notes reducing the principal to $189.2 million and resulting in a loss of $0.2 million. The loss resulted from the write off of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the purchased notes. In June 2016, we elected to repay the outstanding $17.1 million principal balance of the installment payment agreement before its maturity date resulting in a loss of $0.4 million from the remaining unamortized discount.\nOur Board of Directors has approved through December 31, 2018, purchases of our common stock under a buyback program (the \"Buyback Program\"). We purchased 0.1 million shares of our common stock for $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, 0.1 million shares of our common stock for $4.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 1.2 million shares of our common stock for $39.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2017 there was a total of $41.5 million available under the Buyback Program.\nIn July 2015, we settled a dispute for the payment of the remaining balances for certain IRU capital lease obligations with a vendor. The IRU assets were fully depreciated in 2012 when the related fiber was replaced and was no longer used by us. The difference between the remaining net present value of the related IRU capital lease obligation and the settlement liability was recorded as a gain on lease obligations of $1.5 million.\nThe 2022 Notes were sold in private offerings for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A and mature on March 1, 2022. Interest accrues at 5.375% and is paid semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The net proceeds from the February 2015 offering were $248.6 million and the net proceeds were $124.3 million from the December 2016 offering after deducting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nThe growth in Internet traffic has a more significant impact on our net-centric customers who represent the vast majority of the traffic on our network and who tend to consume the majority of their allocated bandwidth on their connections. Net-centric customers tend to purchase their service on a price per megabit basis. Our corporate customers tend to utilize a small portion of their allocated bandwidth on their connections and tend to purchase their service on a per connection basis.\nDue to our strategic acquisitions of network assets and equipment, we believe we are well positioned to grow our revenue base. We continue to purchase and deploy network equipment to parts of our network to maximize the utilization of our assets and to expand and increase the capacity of our\nNM-Not meaningful\nWe are a facilities-based provider of low-cost, high-speed Internet access, private network services and data center colocation space. Our network is specifically designed and optimized to transmit packet-switched data using IP. We deliver our services primarily to small and medium-sized businesses, communications service providers and other bandwidth-intensive organizations in North America, Europe and in Asia.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (\"ASU 2016-02\"). ASU 2016-02 will replace most existing lease accounting guidance when it becomes effective. ASU 2016-02 is effective for us beginning on January 1, 2019. Early application is permitted. ASU 2016-02 currently must be adopted using the modified retrospective approach for all leases that exist at or commence after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented (with the option to apply certain practical expedients), which for us will be the period beginning January 1, 2017. However, in January 2018 the FASB issued a Proposed Accounting Standards Update which, among other changes, if approved would allow a company to elect to adopt ASU 2016-02 using a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of its retained earnings on the adoption date. ASU 2016-02 will require us to record a right to use asset and a lease liability for most of our leases, including our leases currently treated as operating leases. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and we will elect to apply certain practical expedients. We have not yet determined the effect of ASU 2016-02 on our ongoing financial reporting or quantified the impact\nService Revenue. Our service revenue increased 10.6% from 2015 to 2016. Exchange rates negatively impacted our increase in service revenue by approximately $0.9 million. All foreign currency comparisons herein reflect results for 2016 translated at the average foreign currency exchange rates for 2015. For 2016 and 2015, on-net, off-net and non-core revenues represented 72.4%, 27.4% and 0.2% and 72.9%, 26.8% and 0.3% of our service revenue, respectively. Revenue recognition standards include guidance relating to any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, gross receipts taxes, Universal Service Fund fees and certain state regulatory fees. We record these taxes\nNet Cash Provided By Operating Activities. Our primary source of operating cash is receipts from our customers who are billed on a monthly basis for our services. Our primary uses of operating cash are payments made to our vendors, employees and interest payments made to our capital lease vendors and our note holders. Our changes in cash provided by operating activities are primarily due to changes in our operating profit and changes in our interest payments. Cash provided by operating activities for 2017, 2016 and 2015 includes interest payments on our note obligations of $30.8 million, $24.5 million and $29.3 million, respectively.\n\n(1)Includes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $573 and $584 for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe indentures governing our 2022 and 2021 Notes, among other things, limit our ability to incur indebtedness; to pay dividends or make other distributions; to make certain investments and other restricted payments; to create liens; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; to incur restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends or make other payments; and to enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. Limitations on the ability to incur additional indebtedness (excluding IRU agreements incurred in the normal course of business) include a restriction on incurring additional indebtedness if our consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the indentures, is greater than 5.0. The indentures prohibit certain payments, such as dividends and stock purchases, when our consolidated leverage ratio, as defined by the indentures, is greater than 4.25. The unrestricted payment amount may be increased by our consolidated cash flow, as defined in the indentures, as long as our consolidated leverage ratio is less than 4.25. Our consolidated leverage ratio is currently above 4.25 as of December 31, 2017, and we have a total of $64.3 million that is permitted for investment payments including dividends and stock purchases.\nGains on Equipment Transactions. We exchanged certain used network equipment and cash consideration for new network equipment resulting in gains of $7.7 million for 2016 and $3.9 million for 2017. The gains are based upon the excess of the estimated fair value of the new network equipment over the carrying amount of the returned used network equipment and the cash paid.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our income tax expense was $9.3 million for 2016 and $7.8 million for 2015. The increase in our income tax expense was primarily related to an increase in deferred income tax expense due to an increase in income before taxes in the United States.\n\nThe accounting policies we believe to be most critical to understanding our financial results and condition or that require complex, significant and subjective management judgments are discussed below.\nWe are a facilities-based provider of Internet access and communications services. Facilities-based providers require significant physical assets, or network facilities, to provide their services. Typically when a facilities-based network services provider begins providing its services in a new jurisdiction losses are incurred for several years until economies of scale have been achieved. Our foreign operations are in Europe, Canada, Mexico and Asia. Europe accounts for roughly 75% of our foreign operations. Our European operations have incurred losses and will continue to do so until our European customer base and revenues have grown enough to achieve sufficient economies of scale.\n(3)These amounts include amounts due under our operating leases.\n\nSenior secured notes-$240.0 million\nOur on-net revenue increased 7.1% from 2016 to 2017. We increased the number of our on-net customer connections by 16.0% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. On-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than on-net revenues primarily due to the 7.8% decline in our on-net ARPU, primarily from a decline in ARPU for our net centric customers. ARPU is determined by dividing revenue for the period by the average customer connections for that period. Our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers is determined by dividing the aggregate monthly recurring fixed charges for those customers by the aggregate committed data rate for the same customers. The decline in on-net ARPU is partly attributed to volume and term based pricing discounts. Additionally, on-net customers who cancel their service from our installed base of customers, in general, have an ARPU that is greater than the ARPU for our new customers due to declining prices primarily for our on-net services sold to our net-centric customers. These trends resulted in the reduction to our on-net ARPU and a 17.4% decline in our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers.\nWe record assets and liabilities under capital leases at the lesser of the present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the assets under lease. We establish the number of renewal option periods used in determining the lease term, if any, based upon our assessment at the inception of the lease of the number of option periods for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in such amount that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. Useful lives are determined based on historical usage with consideration given to technological changes and trends in the industry that could impact the asset utilization. We estimate the fair value of leased assets primarily using estimated replacement cost data for similar assets.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in the United States limits the utilization of net operating losses when ownership changes, as defined by that section, occur. We have performed an analysis of our Section 382 ownership changes and have determined that the utilization of certain of our net operating loss carryforwards in the United States is limited.\nCapital Lease Obligations\nOur on-net revenue increased 9.8% from 2015 to 2016. We increased the number of our on-net customer connections by 16.3% from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. On-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than on-net revenues primarily due to the 4.9% decline in our on-net ARPU, primarily from a decline in ARPU for our net centric customers. ARPU is determined by dividing revenue for the period by the average customer connections for that period. Our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers is determined by dividing the aggregate monthly recurring fixed charges for those customers by the aggregate committed data rate for the same customers. The decline in on-net ARPU is partly attributed to volume and term based pricing discounts. Additionally, on-net customers who cancel their service from our installed base of customers, in general, have an ARPU that is greater than the ARPU for our new customers due to declining prices primarily for our on-net services sold to our net-centric customers. These trends resulted in the reduction to our on-net ARPU and a 16.8% decline in our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers.\nOur on-net service consists of high-speed Internet access and private network services at speeds ranging from 100 Megabits per second to 100 Gigabits per second. We offer our on-net services to customers located in buildings that are physically connected to our network. We provide on-net Internet access and private network services to corporate customers and net-centric customers. Our corporate customers are located in multi-tenant office buildings and in our data centers and typically include law firms, financial services firms, advertising and marketing firms and other professional services businesses. Our net-centric customers include bandwidth-intensive users such as other Internet access providers, telephone companies, cable television companies, web hosting companies, content delivery networks and commercial content and application service providers. These net-centric customers generally receive our services in colocation facilities and in our data centers.\nOur non-core revenue decreased 12.8% from 2016 to 2017. We do not actively market these acquired non-core services and expect that the service revenue associated with them will continue to decline.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements-to be Adopted\n\nBuildings On-net. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 we had a total of 2,373 and 2,251 on-net buildings connected to our network, respectively.\nGains on capital lease terminations. In March 2015 we elected to terminate certain IRU capital lease obligations with a vendor. Under our estimate of the termination provisions of the related contract we recorded an estimated termination liability of $8.1 million in March 2015. The difference between the remaining net present value of the related IRU capital leases, the remaining net book value of the IRU assets and the termination liability and amounts due through the termination date was recorded as a gain on capital lease termination of $10.1 million in 2015.\n(1)These amounts include interest and principal payment obligations on our $375.0 million of 2022 Notes through the maturity date of March 1, 2022 and interest and principal payments on our $189.2 million of 2021 Notes through the maturity date of April 15, 2021 and $10.7 million due under an installment payment agreement with a vendor.\nRevenue from our corporate and net-centric customers represented 60.4% and 39.6% of our service revenue, respectively, for 2016, and represented 58.3% and 41.7% of our service revenue, respectively, for 2015. Revenue from corporate customers increased 14.7% from $235.5 million for 2015 to $270.1 million for 2016 due to an increase in our number of corporate customers. Revenue from our net-centric customers increased by 4.8% from $168.7 million for 2015 to $176.8 million for 2016 primarily due to an increase in our number of net-centric customers, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and a decline in our average price per megabit.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur total indebtedness, at par, at December 31, 2017 was $732.5 million. Our total indebtedness at December 31, 2017 includes $157.5 million of capital lease obligations for dark fiber primarily under 15-20 year IRUs. Our total cash and cash equivalents were $247.0 million at December 31, 2017.\n(2)Includes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $12,686 and $10,162 for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nNet Cash Used In Investing Activities. Our primary use of investing cash is for purchases of property and equipment. These amounts were $45.8 million, $45.2 million and $35.6 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The annual changes in purchases of property and equipment are primarily due to the timing and scope of our network expansion activities including geographic expansion and adding buildings to our network. In 2017, 2016 and 2015 we obtained $9.0 million, $5.5 million and $21.9 million, respectively, of network equipment and software in non-cash exchanges for notes payable under an installment payment agreement.\nFuture Capital Requirements\nOur off-net services are sold to businesses that are connected to our network primarily by means of \"last mile\" access service lines obtained from other carriers, primarily in the form of metropolitan Ethernet circuits. Our non-core services, which consist primarily of legacy services of companies whose assets or businesses we have acquired. We do not actively market these non-core services and expect the service revenue associated with them to continue to decline.\nOur non-core revenue decreased 6.6% from 2015 to 2016. We do not actively market these acquired non-core services and expect that the service revenue associated with them will continue to decline.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense results from interest incurred on our $125.0 million of senior secured notes that we issued on December 2, 2016, $250.0 million of senior secured notes that we issued on February 20, 2015, $200.0 million of senior unsecured notes that we issued on April 9, 2014, $240.0 million of senior secured notes that we issued in August 2013 and January 2011 and redeemed in March 2015, interest on our installment payment agreement and interest on our capital lease obligations. Our interest expense decreased by 1.2% primarily due to the March 2015 redemption of our $240 million of 8.375% senior secured notes that carried a higher interest rate than our $250.0 million of 5.375% senior secured notes that we issued in February 2015. Additionally, in March 2015 we elected to terminate $29.9 million of capital lease obligations in Spain with a vendor reducing our interest expense on our capital leases.\n\nOur management reviews and analyzes several key financial measures in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and variability of our service revenue, operating results and cash flows. The following summary tables present a comparison of our results of operations with respect to certain key financial measures. The comparisons illustrated in the tables are discussed in greater detail below.\nWe do not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.\nFuture economic instability in the global economy, which could affect spending on Internet services; the impact of changing foreign exchange rates (in particular the Euro to US dollar and Canadian dollar to US dollar exchange rates) on the translation of our non-US dollar denominated revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities; legal and operational difficulties in new markets; the imposition of a requirement that we contribute to the United States Universal Service Fund on the basis of our Internet revenue; changes in government policy and/or regulation, including rules regarding data protection, cyber security and net neutrality; increasing competition leading to lower prices for our services; our ability to attract new customers and to increase and maintain the volume of traffic on our network; the ability to maintain our Internet peering arrangements on favorable terms; our ability to renew our long-term leases of optical fiber that comprise our network; our reliance on an equipment vendor, Cisco Systems Inc., and the potential for hardware or software problems associated with such equipment; the dependence of our network on the quality and dependability of third-party fiber providers; our ability to retain certain customers that comprise a significant portion of our revenue base; the management of network failures and/or disruptions; and outcomes in litigation as well as other risks discussed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, this annual report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022 Our valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset reflects the uncertainty surrounding the realization of our net operating loss carry-forwards and our other deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are established when management determines it is \"more likely than not\" that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. At each balance sheet date, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets. We consider all available positive and negative evidence, on a jurisdictional basis, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance including our operating results, ongoing tax planning, and our forecast of future taxable income. We base our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws, rates and interpretations, and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. We develop our estimates of future profitability based on our historical data and experience and our judgment and expectations. Changes in existing tax laws and rates, their related interpretations, and the uncertainty generated by the current economic environment may affect the amounts of our deferred tax liabilities or the valuations of our deferred tax assets overtime. Significant judgment is required with respect to the determination of whether a valuation allowance is required for certain of our deferred tax assets. Our accounting for\nResults of Operations\nRevenue Recognition\nLimitations under the indentures\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\"). Our SG&A expenses, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, increased 6.7% from 2015 to 2016. Non cash equity-based compensation expense is included in SG&A expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation and was $10.9 million for 2015 and $10.2 million for 2016. SG&A expenses increased primarily from an increase in salaries and related costs required to support our expansion and increases in our sales efforts, an increase in our headcount and a $3.1 million charge related to a proposed settlement of a class action wage and hour claim for certain of our current and past sales reps, partly offset by a $0.5 million decrease in our legal fees primarily associated with U.S.\nGeneral Overview\nbilled to our customers on a gross basis (as service revenue and network operations expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. The impact of these taxes including the Universal Service Fund resulted in an increase of our revenues for 2016 of approximately $5.5 million.\nWe believe that our cash on hand and cash generated from our operating activities will be adequate to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service, dividend payments and other cash requirements for the next twelve months if we execute our business plan.\nWe have established allowances associated with uncollectible accounts receivable and certain of our deferred tax assets.\nWe believe some of the most important trends in our industry are the continued long-term growth in Internet traffic and a decline in Internet access prices on a per megabit basis. The effective price per megabit for our corporate customers is declining as the bandwidth utilization and connection size of our corporate customer connections increases. As Internet traffic continues to grow and prices per unit of traffic continue to decline, we believe we can continue to load our network and gain market share from less efficient network operators. However, continued erosion in Internet access prices will likely have a negative impact on the rate at which we can increase our revenues and our profitability. Our revenue may also be negatively affected if we are unable to grow our Internet traffic or if the rate of growth of Internet traffic does not offset an expected decline in our per unit pricing. We do not know if Internet traffic will increase or decrease, or the rate at which it will increase or decrease. Changes in Internet traffic will be a function of the number of Internet users, the amount of time users spend on the Internet, the applications for which the Internet is used, the bandwidth intensity of these applications and the pricing of Internet services, and other factors.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses. Our depreciation and amortization expenses increased 0.9% from 2016 to 2017. The increase is primarily due to the depreciation expense associated with the increase related to newly deployed fixed assets more than offsetting the decline in depreciation expense from fully depreciated fixed assets.\nIndebtedness\n\u2022 Our valuation allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is designed to account for the expense associated with accounts receivable that we estimate will not be collected. We assess the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating general factors, such as the length of time individual receivables are past due, historical collection experience, and changes in the credit-worthiness of our customers. We also assess the ability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to us and establish specific allowances based on the amount we expect to collect from these customers. If circumstances relating to specific customers change or economic conditions change such that our past collections experience and assessment of the economic environment are no longer appropriate, our estimate of the recoverability of our trade receivables could be impacted.\n(2)The capital lease obligations above were incurred in connection with IRUs for inter-city and intra-city dark fiber underlying substantial portions of our network. These capital leases are presented on our balance sheet at the net present value of the future minimum lease payments, or $157.5 million at December 31, 2017. These leases generally have initial terms of 15 to 20 years\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\". This guidance is intended to introduce a revised approach to the recognition and measurement of credit losses, emphasizing an updated model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. This new standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance may have on our financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nNetwork Operations Expenses. Network operations expenses include the costs of personnel associated with service delivery, network management, and customer support, network facilities costs, fiber and equipment maintenance fees, leased circuit costs, and access and facilities fees paid to building owners. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense is included in network operations expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation. Our network operations expenses, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, increased 11.2% from 2015 to 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in costs related to our network and facilities expansion activities, a $5.5 million increase in excise taxes billed to our customers recorded on a gross basis (in service revenue and cost of network operations expense) and the increase in our off-net revenues. When we provide off-net services we also assume the cost of the associated tail-circuits.\n\nValuation Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Receivable and Deferred Tax Assets\nIn March 2015, Group redeemed its $240.0 million 8.375% senior notes due in 2018 (the \"2018 Notes\") with the proceeds from its February 2015 issuance of $250.0 million of 5.375% senior secured notes (the \"2022 Notes\") and existing cash on hand. In February 2015 we deposited $251.6 million with the trustee for the benefit of the holders of the 2018 Notes in order to redeem on March 12, 2015 the entire outstanding amount of 2018 Notes at a redemption price of 104.188% of the $240.0 million principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a result of this transaction we incurred a loss on debt extinguishment and redemption of $10.1 million. In December 2016, we issued an additional $125.0 million of our 2022 Notes at a premium of 100.365%.\nNet Cash (Used In) Provided By Financing Activities. Our primary uses of cash for financing activities are for dividend payments, stock purchases and principal payments under our capital lease obligations. In 2015 we redeemed our $240.0 million senior secured notes for a payment of $251.3 million. Amounts paid under our stock buyback program were $1.8 million for 2017, $4.5 million for 2016 and $39.4 million for 2015. During 2017, 2016 and 2015 we paid $81.7 million, $68.2 million and $66.3 million, respectively, for our quarterly dividend payments. Our quarterly dividend payments have increased due to regular quarterly increases in our quarterly dividend per share amounts. Principal payments under our capital lease obligations were $11.2 million, $12.5 million and $20.2 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are impacted by the timing and extent of our network expansion activities. Our financing activities also include proceeds from and repayments of our debt offerings. In December 2016 we received net proceeds of $124.3 million from the issuance of our $125.0 million of", "item_7_tables": "Table 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Holdings, Inc. as the new parent company. \n\n- Service revenue increased 8.6% from 2016 to 2017, driven by growth in on-net and off-net revenue. On-net revenue grew due to more customer connections, while off-net revenue rose due to more customers and higher prices.\n\n- Network operations expenses grew 7.8% and SG&A expenses grew 6.0% from 2016 to 2017, mostly due to company growth and expansion. \n\n- Interest expense increased 18.8% in 2017 due to new debt issuances in late 2016.\n\n- Income tax expense grew significantly in 2017 due to higher pre-tax income and the impact of the new tax law which required a revaluation of deferred tax assets.\n\n- The company has $702 million of debt maturing over the next 5 years and $335 million of capital lease obligations. \n\n- The company believes its cash from operations and cash on hand will meet working capital, capex, debt service and dividend needs over the next 12 months.\n\n- Cogent expects to adopt the new revenue recognition standard in 2018 which will impact timing of revenue recognition for installations and capitalization of commissions."}
