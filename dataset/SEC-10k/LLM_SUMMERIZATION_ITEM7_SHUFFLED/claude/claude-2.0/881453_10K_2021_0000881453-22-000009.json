Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" included below the Table of Contents, Risk Factors\u201d, and the Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThe Company was established in 1969 and has been a provider of annuity contracts for the individual market in the United States. The Company's products have been sold primarily to individuals to provide for long-term savings and retirement needs and to address the economic impact of premature death, estate planning concerns and supplemental retirement income.\nThe Company has sold a wide array of annuities, including deferred and immediate variable annuities with (1) fixed interest rate allocation options, subject to a market value adjustment, that are registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d), and (2) fixed-rate allocation options subject to a limited market value adjustment or no market value adjustment and not registered with the SEC. The Company ceased offering these products in March 2010. In 2018, the Company resumed offering annuity products to new investors (except in New York). For more information on products, see \"Item 1 Business-Products\".\nEffective July 1, 2021, Pruco Life Insurance Company ( Pruco Life\u201d) recaptured the risks related to its business, as discussed above, that had previously been reinsured to the Company from April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2021. The recapture does not impact Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey ( PLNJ\u201d), which will continue to reinsure its new and in force business to The Prudential Insurance Company of America ( Prudential Insurance\u201d). The product risks related to the previously reinsured business that were being managed in the Company, were transferred to Pruco Life. In addition, the living benefit hedging program related to the previously reinsured living benefit riders are being managed within Pruco Life. This transaction is referred to as the \"2021 Variable Annuities Recapture\".\nEffective December 1, 2021, the Company entered into a reinsurance agreement with Pruco Life under which the Company reinsured all of its variable and fixed indexed annuities and fixed annuities with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal income feature to Pruco Life.\nSale of PALAC\nIn September 2021, Prudential Annuities, Inc. ( PAI\u201d) entered into a definitive agreement to sell its equity interest in Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corporation (the Company\u201d or PALAC\u201d) to Fortitude Group Holdings, LLC. The transaction will result in a benefit to Prudential Financial Inc. (\"Prudential Financial\") comprised of the purchase price for PALAC, a pre-closing net capital distribution by PALAC and an expected tax impact. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nCOVID-19\nSince the first quarter of 2020, the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) has caused extreme stress and disruption in the global economy and financial markets, and elevated mortality and morbidity for the global population. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our results of operations in the current period and is expected to impact our results of operations in future periods.\nIn 2021, the United States experienced multiple waves of COVID-19, with the severity of each wave depending on such factors as seasonality, varying levels of population immunity, and the evolution of the virus itself into different variants. Deaths from COVID-19 in the United States peaked in the first quarter of 2021, prior to widespread vaccination, and again in the third quarter, due to the emergence of the Delta variant. In December, the Omicron variant emerged in the United States and has since become the dominant strain, causing many more infections but with a smaller percentage of infections resulting in hospitalizations and deaths compared to prior waves. Several vaccines are now widely accessible and other therapeutics, such as antiviral treatments, are increasingly becoming available. As a result, the overall financial impact to the Company is expected to remain manageable; however, the future evolution of the virus, among other factors, could cause the actual course of the pandemic to differ from our current expectations. The Company has taken several measures to manage the impacts of this pandemic. The actual and expected impacts of these measures and other items are set forth below:\n\u2022Results of Operations. See Results of Operations\u201d for a discussion of results for the full year of 2021.\n\u2022Business Continuity. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been executing Prudential Financial's and our business continuity protocols to ensure our employees are safe and able to serve our customers. This included effectively transitioning the vast majority of our employees to remote work arrangements in 2020 and 2021.\nWe believe we can sustain long-term remote work and social distancing while ensuring that critical business operations are sustained. In addition, we are managing COVID-19-related impacts on third-party provided services, and do not anticipate significant interruption in critical operations.\n\u2022Risk Factors. See Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the risks to our businesses posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022CARES Act and Other Regulatory Developments. See \"Business-Regulation\" for additional information.\nRevenues and Expenses\nThe Company earns revenues principally from contract charges, mortality and expense fees, asset administration fees from annuity and investment products and from net investment income on the investment of general account and other funds. The Company earns contract fees, mortality and expense fees and asset administration fees primarily from the sale and servicing of annuity products. The Company's operating expenses principally consist of annuity benefit guarantees provided and reserves established for anticipated future annuity benefit guarantees and costs of managing risk related to these products, interest credited to contractholders' account balances, general business expenses, reinsurance premiums, commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products it sold.\nIndustry Trends\nOur business is impacted by financial markets, economic conditions, regulatory oversight, and a variety of trends that affect the industries where we compete.\nFinancial and Economic Environment. Interest rates in the U.S. have experienced a sustained period of historically low levels, which continue to negatively impact our investment-related activity, including our investment income returns, net investment spread results, and portfolio income and reinvestment yields. See Impact of a Low Interest Rate Environment\u201d below. In addition, we are subject to financial impacts associated with movements in equity markets and the evolution of the credit cycle as discussed in Risk Factors\u201d.\nDemographics. Customer demographics continue to evolve and new opportunities present themselves in different consumer segments such as the millennial and multicultural markets. Consumer expectations and preferences are changing. We believe existing customers and potential customers are increasingly looking for cost-effective solutions that they can easily understand and access through technology-enabled devices. At the same time, income protection, wealth accumulation and the needs of retiring baby boomers are continuing to shape the insurance industry. A persistent retirement security gap exists in terms of both savings and protection. Despite the ongoing phenomenon of the risk and responsibility of retirement savings shifting from employers to employees, employers are becoming increasingly focused on the financial wellness of the individuals they employ.\nRegulatory Environment. See Business-Regulation\u201d for a discussion of regulatory developments that may impact the Company and the associated risks.\nCompetitive Environment. See Business\u201d for a discussion of the competitive environment and the basis on which we compete.\nImpact of a Low Interest Rate Environment\nAs a financial services company, market interest rates are a key driver of the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Changes in interest rates can affect our results of operations and/or our financial condition in several ways, including favorable or adverse impacts to:\n\u2022 investment-related activity, including: investment income returns, net interest margins, net investment spread results,\nnew money rates, mortgage loan prepayments and bond redemptions;\n\u2022 hedging costs and other risk mitigation activities;\n\u2022 insurance reserve levels, market experience true-ups and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (\"DAC\")/value of business acquired ( VOBA\u201d)/deferred sales inducements (\"DSI\");\n\u2022 customer account values, including their impact on fee income;\n\u2022fair value of, and possible impairments, on intangible assets;\n\u2022product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix; and\n\u2022policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity.\nFor more information on interest rate risks, see \"Risk Factors-Market Risk\".\nAccounting Policies & Pronouncements\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Management, on an ongoing basis, reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements. If management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances, the Company's results of operations and financial position as reported in the Financial Statements could change significantly.\nThe following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.\nInsurance Assets\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Deferred Sales Inducements\nWe capitalize costs that are directly related to the acquisition of annuity contracts. These costs primarily include commissions, as well as costs of policy issuance and underwriting and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully negotiated contracts. We have also deferred costs associated with sales inducements offered in the past related to our variable and fixed annuity contracts. Sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the policyholders' account balances mainly as an inducement to purchase the contract. For additional information about sales inducements, see Note 9 to the Financial Statements. We generally amortize DAC and DSI over the expected lives of the contracts, based on our estimates of the level and timing of gross profits. As described in more detail below, in calculating DAC and DSI amortization we are required to make assumptions about investment returns, mortality, persistency, and other items that impact our estimates of the level and timing of gross profits. We also periodically evaluate the recoverability of our DAC and DSI. For certain contracts, this evaluation is performed as part of our premium deficiency testing, as discussed further below in Insurance Liabilities-Future Policy Benefits\". As of December 31, 2021, DAC and DSI were $567 million and $295 million, respectively.\nAmortization methodologies\nWe generally amortize DAC and other costs over the expected life of the policies in proportion to total gross profits. Total gross profits include both actual gross profits and estimates of gross profits for future periods. Gross profits are defined as (i) amounts assessed for mortality, contract administration, surrender charges, and other assessments plus amounts earned from investment of policyholder balances, less (ii) benefits in excess of policyholder balances, costs incurred for contract administration, the net cost of reinsurance for certain products, interest credited to policyholder balances and other credits. If significant negative gross profits are expected in any periods, the amount of insurance in force is generally substituted as the base for computing amortization. U.S. GAAP gross profits and amortization rates also include the impacts of the embedded derivatives associated with certain of the optional living benefit features of our variable annuity contracts and indexed annuity contracts and related hedging activities. In calculating amortization expense, we estimate the amounts of gross profits that will be included in our U.S. GAAP results, and utilize these estimates to calculate distinct amortization rates and expense amounts. In addition, in calculating gross profits, we include the profits and losses related to contracts previously issued by the Company that are reported in affiliated legal entities other than the Company as a result of, for example, reinsurance agreements with those affiliated entities. The Company is an indirect subsidiary of Prudential Financial (an SEC registrant) and has extensive transactions and relationships with other subsidiaries of Prudential Financial, including reinsurance agreements, as discussed in Note 10 and Note 14 to the Financial Statements. Incorporating all product-related profits and losses in gross profits, including those that are reported in affiliated legal entities, produces an amortization pattern representative of the total economics of the products. For a further discussion of the amortization of DAC and other costs, see -Results of Operations\u201d.\nWe also regularly evaluate and adjust the related DAC and DSI balances with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the impact of actual gross profits and changes in our projections of estimated future gross profits on our DAC and DSI amortization rates. Adjustments to the DAC and DSI balances include the impact to our estimate of total gross profits of the annual review of assumptions, our quarterly adjustments for current period experience, and our quarterly adjustments for market performance. Each of these adjustments is further discussed below in -Annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments\u201d.\nValue of Business Acquired\nIn addition to DAC and DSI, we also recognize an asset for value of business acquired, or VOBA, which is an intangible asset that represents an adjustment to the stated value of acquired in-force insurance contract liabilities to present them at fair value, determined as of the acquisition date. VOBA is amortized over the expected life of the acquired contracts using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC and DSI (see -Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Deferred Sales Inducements\u201d above for additional information). VOBA is also subject to recoverability testing. As of December 31, 2021, VOBA was $28 million.\nAnnual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments\nWe perform an annual comprehensive review of the assumptions used in estimating gross profits for future periods. Over the last several years, the Company's most significant assumption updates that have resulted in a change to expected future gross profits and the amortization of DAC, DSI and VOBA have been related to lapse and other contractholder behavior assumptions, mortality, and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments. These assumptions may also cause potential significant variability in amortization expense in the future. The impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.\nThe quarterly adjustments for current period experience referred to above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for a given period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for that period. To the extent each period's actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period, the assumed level of total gross profits may change. In these cases, we recognize a cumulative adjustment to all previous periods' amortization, also referred to as an experience true-up adjustment.\nThe quarterly adjustments for market performance referred to above reflect the impact of changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance and market conditions. A significant portion of gross profits for our variable annuity contracts is dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options. This rate of return influences the fees we earn on variable annuity contracts, costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts, as well as other sources of profit. Returns that are higher than our expectations for a given period produce higher than expected account balances, which increase the future fees we expect to earn on variable annuity contracts and decrease the future costs we expect to incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts. The opposite occurs when returns are lower than our expectations. The changes in future expected gross profits are used to recognize a cumulative adjustment to all prior periods' amortization.\nThe weighted average rate of return assumptions used in developing estimated market returns consider many factors specific to each product type, including asset durations, asset allocations and other factors. With regard to equity market assumptions, the near-term future rate of return assumption used in evaluating DAC, DSI and VOBA and liabilities for future policy benefits for certain of our products, primarily our domestic variable annuity products, is generally updated each quarter and is derived using a reversion to the mean approach, a common industry practice. Under this approach, we consider historical equity returns and adjust projected equity returns over an initial future period of five years (the near-term\u201d) so that equity returns converge to the long-term expected rate of return. If the near-term projected future rate of return is greater than our near-term maximum future rate of return of 15.0%, we use our maximum future rate of return. If the near-term projected future rate of return is lower than our near-term minimum future rate of return of 0%, we use our minimum future rate of return. As of December 31, 2021, we assume an 8.0% long-term equity expected rate of return and a 0.0% near-term mean reversion equity expected rate of return.\nWith regard to interest rate assumptions used in evaluating DAC, DSI and liabilities for future policy benefits for certain of our products, we generally update the long-term and near-term future rates used to project fixed income returns annually and quarterly, respectively. As a result of our 2021 annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, we kept our long-term expectation of the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate unchanged and continue to grade to a rate of 3.25% over ten years. As part of our quarterly market experience updates, we update our near-term projections of interest rates to reflect changes in current rates.\nInsurance Liabilities\nFuture Policy Benefits\nFuture Policy Benefit Reserves\nWe establish reserves for future policy benefits to, or on behalf of, policyholders, using methodologies prescribed by U.S. GAAP. The reserving methodologies used include the following:\n\u2022For life contingent payout annuities, we utilize a net premium valuation methodology in measuring the liability for future policy benefits. Under this methodology, a liability for future policy benefits is accrued when premium revenue is recognized. The liability, which represents the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums (portion of the gross premium required to provide for all benefits and expenses), is estimated using methods that include assumptions applicable at the time the insurance contracts are made with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as appropriate. Original assumptions continue to be used in subsequent accounting periods to determine changes in the liability for future policy benefits (often referred to as the lock-in concept\u201d), unless a premium deficiency exists. The result of the net premium valuation methodology is that the liability at any point in time represents an accumulation of the portion of premiums received to date expected to be needed to fund future benefits (i.e., net premiums received to date), less any benefits and expenses already paid. The liability does not necessarily reflect the full policyholder obligation the Company expects to pay at the conclusion of the contract since a portion of that obligation would be funded by net premiums received in the future and would be recognized in the liability at that time. We perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation. If the liabilities determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net reserves (i.e., GAAP reserves net of any DAC, DSI or VOBA asset), the existing net reserves are adjusted by first reducing these assets by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings. If the deficiency is more than these asset balances for insurance contracts, we then increase the net reserves by the excess, again through a charge to current period earnings. If a premium deficiency is recognized, the assumptions as of the premium deficiency test date are locked-in and used in subsequent valuations and the net reserves continue to be subject to premium deficiency testing. In addition, for limited-payment contracts, future policy benefit reserves also include a deferred profit liability representing gross premiums received in excess of net premiums. The deferred profits are generally recognized in revenue in a constant relationship with insurance in force or with the amount of expected future benefit payments.\n\u2022For certain contract features, such as those related to guaranteed minimum death benefits ( GMDB\u201d) and guaranteed minimum income benefits ( GMIB\u201d), a liability is established when associated assessments (which include policy charges for administration, mortality, expense, surrender, and other, regardless of how characterized) are recognized. This liability is established using current best estimate assumptions and is based on the ratio of the present value of total expected excess payments (e.g., payments in excess of account value) over the life of the contract divided by the present value of total expected assessments (i.e., benefit ratio). The liability equals the current benefit ratio multiplied by cumulative assessments recognized to date, plus interest, less cumulative excess payments to date. The result of the benefit ratio method is that the liability at any point in time represents an accumulation of the portion of assessments received to date expected to be needed to fund future excess payments, less any excess payments already paid. The liability does not necessarily reflect the full policyholder obligation the Company expects to pay at the conclusion of the contract since a portion of that excess payment would be funded by assessments received in the future and would be recognized in the liability at that time. Similar to as described above for DAC, the reserves are subject to adjustments based on annual reviews of assumptions and quarterly adjustments for experience, including market performance. These adjustments reflect the impact on the benefit ratio of using actual historical experience from the issuance date to the balance sheet date plus updated estimates of future experience. The updated benefit ratio is then applied to all prior periods' assessments to derive an adjustment to the reserve recognized through a benefit or charge to current period earnings.\n\u2022For certain product guarantees, primarily certain optional living benefit features of the variable annuity products including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ( GMAB\u201d), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ( GMWB\u201d) and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits ( GMIWB\u201d), the benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives using a fair value accounting framework. The fair value of these contracts is calculated as the present value of expected future benefit payments to contractholders less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. Under U.S. GAAP, the fair values of these benefit features are based on assumptions a market participant would use in valuing these embedded derivatives. Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives are recorded quarterly through a benefit or charge to current period earnings. For additional information regarding the valuation of these embedded derivatives, see Note 5 to the Financial Statements.\nThe assumptions used in establishing reserves are generally based on the Company's experience, industry experience and/or other factors, as applicable. We update our actuarial assumptions, such as mortality and policyholder behavior assumptions annually, unless a material change is observed in an interim period that we feel is indicative of a long-term trend. Generally, we do not expect trends to change significantly in the short-term and, to the extent these trends may change, we expect such changes to be gradual over the long-term. In a sustained low interest rate environment, there is an increased likelihood that the reserves determined based on best estimate assumptions may be greater than the net liabilities.\nThe following paragraphs provide additional details about the reserves we have established:\nThe reserves for future policy benefits of our business relate to reserves for the GMDB and GMIB features of our variable annuities, and for the optional living benefit features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives. As discussed above, in establishing reserves for GMDBs and GMIBs, we utilize current best estimate assumptions. The primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves generally include annuitization, lapse, withdrawal and mortality assumptions, as well as interest rate and equity market return assumptions. Lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on the in-the-moneyness of the benefit and reflect other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. Lapse rates are reduced when contracts are more in-the-money. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower for the period where surrender charges apply. For life contingent payout annuity contracts, we establish reserves using best estimate assumptions with provisions for adverse deviations as of inception or best estimate assumptions as of the most recent loss recognition date.\nThe reserves for certain optional living benefit features, including GMAB, GMWB and GMIWB are accounted for as embedded derivatives at fair value, as described above. This methodology could result in either a liability or contra-liability balance, given changing capital market conditions and various actuarial assumptions. Since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations, the valuations are calculated using internally-developed models with option pricing techniques. The models are based on a risk neutral valuation framework and incorporate premiums for risks inherent in valuation techniques, inputs, and the general uncertainty around the timing and amount of future cash flows. The significant inputs to the valuation models for these embedded derivatives include capital market assumptions, such as interest rate levels and volatility assumptions, the Company's market-perceived risk of its own non-performance risk ( NPR\u201d), as well as actuarially determined assumptions, including mortality rates and contractholder behavior, such as lapse rates, benefit utilization rates and withdrawal rates. Capital market inputs and actual contractholders' account values are updated each quarter based on capital market conditions as of the end of the quarter, including interest rates, equity markets and volatility. In the risk neutral valuation, the initial swap curve drives the total returns used to grow the contractholders' account values. The Company's discount rate assumption is based on the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) swap curve adjusted for an additional spread, which includes an estimate of NPR. Actuarial assumptions, including contractholder behavior and mortality, are reviewed at least annually and updated based upon emerging experience, future expectations and other data, including any observable market data, such as available industry studies or market transactions such as acquisitions and reinsurance transactions. For additional information regarding the valuation of these optional living benefit features, see Note 5 to the Financial Statements.\nPolicyholders' Account Balances\nPolicyholders' account balances liability represents the contract value that has accrued to the benefit of the policyholder as of the balance sheet date. This liability is primarily associated with the accumulated account deposits, plus interest credited, less policyholder withdrawals and other charges assessed against the account balance, as applicable. The liability also includes provisions for benefits under non-life contingent payout annuities. Policyholders' account balances also include amounts representing the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with the index-linked features of certain annuity products. For additional information regarding the valuation of these embedded derivatives, see Note 5 to the Financial Statements.\nSensitivities for Insurance Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table summarizes the impact that could result on each of the listed financial statement balances from changes in certain key assumptions. The information below is for illustrative purposes and includes only the hypothetical direct impact on December 31, 2021 balances of changes in a single assumption and not changes in any combination of assumptions. Additionally, the illustration of the insurance assumption impacts below reflects a parallel shift in the insurance assumptions; however, these may be non-parallel in practice. Changes in current assumptions could result in impacts to financial statement balances that are in excess of the amounts illustrated. A description of the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of each of these financial statement balances is provided above. For traditional long-duration and limited-payment contracts, U.S. GAAP requires the original assumptions used when the contracts are issued to be locked-in and that those assumptions be used in all future liability calculations as long as the resulting liabilities are adequate to provide for the future benefits and expenses (i.e., there is no premium deficiency). Therefore, these products are not reflected in the sensitivity table below unless the hypothetical change in assumption would result in an adverse impact that would cause a premium deficiency. Similarly, the impact of any favorable change in assumptions for traditional long-duration and limited-payment contracts is not reflected in the table below given that the current assumption is required to remain locked-in and instead the positive impacts would be recognized into net income over the life of the policies in force.\nThe impacts presented within this table exclude the related impacts of our asset liability management strategy, which seeks to offset the changes in the balances presented within this table and is primarily composed of investments and derivatives. See further below for a discussion of the estimates and assumptions involved with the application of U.S. GAAP accounting policies for these instruments and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d for hypothetical impacts on related balances as a result of changes in certain significant assumptions.\nTable 9: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) in </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs, Deferred Sales Inducements and Value of Business Acquired </td> <td> </td> <td>Reinsurance Recoverables </td> <td> </td> <td>Future Policy Benefits and Policyholders' Account Balances </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Impact </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hypothetical change in current assumptions: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 25 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 25 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term equity expected rate of return </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 50 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 50 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NPR credit spread </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 50 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(90) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(30) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(390) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>270 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 50 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(290) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortality </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 1% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(40) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 1% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lapse </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 10% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(120) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 10% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(105) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nValuation of Investments, Including Derivatives, Measurement of Allowance for Credit Loss, and the Recognition of Other-than-Temporary Impairments\nOur investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities, other invested assets and derivative financial instruments. Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or the values of securities. Derivative financial instruments we generally use include swaps, futures, forwards and options and may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) market. We are also party to financial instruments that contain derivative instruments that are embedded\u201d in the financial instruments. Management believes the following accounting policies related to investments, including derivatives, are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. Each of these policies is discussed further within other relevant disclosures related to investments and derivatives, as referenced below:\n\u2022Valuation of investments, including derivatives;\n\u2022Measurement of the allowance for credit losses on fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale, commercial mortgage loans, and other loans; and\n\u2022Recognition of other-than-temporary impairments (\"OTTI\") for equity method investments.\nWe present at fair value in the statements of financial position our debt security investments classified as available-for-sale, investments classified as trading, and certain fixed maturities, equity securities, and certain investments within Other invested assets,\u201d such as derivatives. For additional information regarding the key estimates and assumptions surrounding the determination of fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities, as well as derivative instruments, embedded derivatives and other investments, see Note 5 to the Financial Statements.\nFor our investments classified as available-for-sale, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\u201d ( AOCI\u201d), a separate component of equity. For our investments classified as trading and equity securities, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within Other income (loss)\u201d. Our commercial mortgage and other loans are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances, net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and expenses and unamortized premiums or discounts and a valuation allowance for losses.\nIn addition, an allowance for credit losses is measured each quarter for available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans. For additional information regarding our policies regarding the measurement of credit losses, see Note 2 to the Financial Statements.\nFor equity method investments, the carrying value of these investments is written down or impaired to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary. For additional information regarding our OTTI policies, see Note 2 to the Financial Statements.\nTaxes on Income\nOur effective tax rate is based on income, non-taxable and non-deductible items, tax credits, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. The Dividend Received Deduction ( DRD\u201d) is a major reason for the difference between the Company's effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate. The DRD is an estimate that incorporates the prior and current year information, as well as the current year's equity market performance. Both the current estimate of the DRD and the DRD in future periods can vary based on factors such as, but not limited to, changes in the amount of dividends received that are eligible for the DRD, changes in the amount of distributions received from underlying fund investments, changes in the account balances of variable life and annuity contracts, and the Company's taxable income before the DRD.\nAn increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by one percentage point would have resulted in a decrease or increase in our 2021 \"Income tax expense (benefit)\" of $63 million.\nThe CARES Act. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) was enacted into law. One provision of the CARES Act amends the Tax Act of 2017 and allows companies with net operating losses ( NOLs\u201d) originating in 2020, 2019 or 2018 to carry back those losses for up to five years. The Company has generated taxable income in 2020. Therefore, there is no impact from the change in law for NOL carry back to tax years that have a 35% tax rate.\nContingencies\nA contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events. Under U.S. GAAP, accruals for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated, such as in connection with an unresolved legal matter. The initial reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and, ultimately, when the matter is brought to closure.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nASU 2018-12, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) on August 15, 2018 and was amended by ASU 2019-09, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Effective Date, issued in October 2019 and ASU 2020-11, Financial Services-Insurance (Topic 944): Effective Date and Early Application, issued in November 2020. Large calendar-year public companies that early adopt ASU 2018-12 are allowed to apply the guidance either as of January 1, 2020 or January 1, 2021 (and record transition adjustments as of January 1, 2020 or January 1, 2021, respectively) in the 2022 financial statements. Companies that do not early adopt ASU 2018-12 would apply the guidance as of January 1, 2021 (and record transition adjustments as of January 1, 2021) in the 2023 financial statements. The Company will adopt ASU 2018-12 using the modified retrospective transition method where permitted.\nASU 2018-12 will impact, at least to some extent, the accounting and disclosure requirements for all long-duration insurance and investment contracts issued by the Company. The Company expects the standard to have a significant financial impact on the Financial Statements and will significantly enhance disclosures. In addition to the significant impacts to the balance sheet upon adoption, the Company also expects an impact to the pattern of earnings emergence following the transition date. See Note 2 to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of ASU 2018-12, as well as other accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted and newly adopted accounting pronouncements.\nChanges in Financial Position\n2021 to 2020 Annual Comparison\nTotal assets decreased $5.7 billion from $64.3 billion at December 31, 2020 to $58.6 billion at December 31, 2021. Significant components were:\n\u2022$10.4 billion decrease in Total investments and Cash and cash equivalents primarily driven by consideration paid related to the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture and new reinsurance with Pruco Life and dividend distributions;\n\u2022$3.7 billion decrease in Deferred policy acquisition costs primarily due to the unwinding of assumed costs as part of the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture and ceding costs as part of the new reinsurance with Pruco Life;\nPartially offset by:\n\u2022$7.4 billion increase in Reinsurance recoverables driven by the new reinsurance with Pruco Life; and\n\u2022$1.9 billion increase in Other assets driven by the new reinsurance with Pruco Life.\nTotal liabilities decreased by $4.6 billion from $61.5 billion at December 31, 2020 to $56.9 billion at December 31, 2021. Significant components were:\n\u2022$14.0 billion decrease in Future policy benefits primarily driven by the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture and a decrease in reserves related to our variable annuity living benefit guarantees due to favorable equity market performance and rising interest rates;\nPartially offset by:\n\u2022$7.0 billion increase in Reinsurance payables driven by the new reinsurance with Pruco Life; and\n\u2022$2.6 billion increase in Policyholders' account balances primarily driven by incremental general account product sales.\nTotal equity decreased $1.0 billion from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020 to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2021, primarily driven by return of capital of $3.8 billion related to the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture and $1.4 billion due to unrealized losses on investments driven by rising interest rates reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), partially offset by an after-tax net income of $4.1 billion.\nResults of Operations\nIncome (loss) from Operations before Income Taxes\n2021 to 2020 Annual Comparison\nIncome (loss) from operations before income taxes increased $10.3 billion from a loss of $4.0 billion in 2020 to a gain of $6.3 billion in 2021. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, income from operations increased $10.4 billion primarily driven by:\n\u2022Significant Realized investment gains (losses), reflecting a favorable impact related to the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture and portions of the U.S. GAAP liability before NPR, that are excluded from our hedge target driven by favorable equity market performance and rising interest rates.\nThe following table illustrates the net impact on our results of operations from changes in the U.S. GAAP embedded derivative liability and hedge positions under the Asset Liability Management (\"ALM\") strategy, and the related amortization of DAC and other costs, for the periods indicated:\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions)(1) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. GAAP embedded derivative and hedging positions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in value of U.S.GAAP liability, pre-NPR(2) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,904) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in the NPR adjustment </td> <td>(945) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>520 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of hedge assets, excluding capital hedges(3) </td> <td>(3,224) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,077 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of capital hedges(4) </td> <td>(900) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(921) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 Variable Annuities Recapture Impact </td> <td>5,142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>1,201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,622 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments </td> <td>7,026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,606) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market experience updates(5) </td> <td>180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(96) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charges related to realized investments gains (losses), net </td> <td>(215) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net impact from changes in the U.S. GAAP embedded derivative and hedge positions, after the impact of NPR, DAC and other costs(6) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,631) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Positive amount represents income; negative amount represents a loss.\n(2)Represents the change in the liability (excluding NPR) for our variable annuities which is measured utilizing a valuation methodology that is required under U.S. GAAP.

Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update to our assumptions and other refinements, the increase was $11.3 billion primarily driven by:\n\u2022Significant Realized investment gains (losses), reflecting a favorable impact to the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture and portions of the U.S. GAAP liability before NPR, that are excluded from our hedge target driven by favorable equity market performance and rising interest rates.\nBenefits and expenses increased $0.9 billion from $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update to our assumptions and other refinements, the increase of $1.1 billion primarily was driven by:\n\u2022Higher Commission expense primarily driven by the unwinding of assumed deferred acquisition costs, partially offset by ceding allowance received as part of the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture.\nRisks and Risk Mitigants\nFixed Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants. The primary risk exposure of our fixed annuity products relates to investment risks we bear for providing customers a minimum guaranteed interest rate or an index-linked interest rate required to be credited to the customer's account value, which include interest rate fluctuations and/or sustained periods of low interest rates, and credit risk related to the underlying investments. We manage these risk exposures primarily through our investment strategies and product design features, which include credit rate resetting subject to the minimum guaranteed interest rate, as well as surrender charges applied during the early years of the contract that help to provide protection for premature withdrawals. In addition, a portion of our fixed annuity products has a market value adjustment provision that affords protection of lapse in the case of rising interest rates. We also manage these risk exposures through affiliated reinsurance. For information on our affiliated reinsurance agreements, see Business-Reinsurance\u201d section and Note 14 to the Financial Statements.\nIndexed Variable Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants. The primary risk exposure of our indexed variable annuity products relates to the investment risks we bear in order to credit to the customer's account balance the required crediting rate based on the performance of the elected indices at the end of each term. We manage this risk primarily through our investment strategies including derivatives and product design features, which include credit rate resetting subject to contractual minimums as well as surrender charges applied during the early years of the contract that help to provide protection for premature withdrawals. In addition, our indexed variable annuity strategies have an interim value provision that provides protection from lapse in the case of rising interest rates. We also manage these risk exposures through affiliated reinsurance. For information on our affiliated reinsurance agreements, see Business-Reinsurance\u201d section and Note 14 to the Financial Statements.\nVariable Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants. The primary risk exposures of our variable annuity contracts relate to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including capital markets assumptions such as equity market returns, interest rates and market volatility, along with actuarial assumptions such as contractholder mortality, the timing and amount of annuitization and withdrawals, and contract lapses. For these risk exposures, achievement of our expected returns is subject to the risk that actual experience will differ from the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products. We manage our exposure to certain risks driven by fluctuations in capital markets primarily through a combination of i) Product Design Features, ii) our Asset Liability Management Strategy, and iii) our Capital Hedge Program as discussed below.\nEffective July 1, 2021, Pruco Life recaptured the risks related to its business that had previously been reinsured to the Company from April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2021. The recapture does not impact PLNJ, which will continue to reinsure its new and in force business to Prudential Insurance. The product risks related to the previously reinsured business that were being managed in the Company, were transferred to Pruco Life. In addition, the living benefit hedging program related to the previously reinsured living benefit riders are being managed within Pruco Life. For more information on this transaction, see Note 1 to the Financial Statements.\ni. Product Design Features:\nA portion of the variable annuity contracts that we offer include an asset transfer feature. This feature is implemented at the contract level, and transfers assets between certain variable investment sub-accounts selected by the annuity contractholder and, depending on the benefit feature, a fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond fund sub-account within the separate account. The objective of the asset transfer feature is to reduce our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility. The transfers are based on a static mathematical formula used with the particular benefit which considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the impact of investment performance on the contractholder's total account value. Other product design features we utilize include, among others, asset allocation restrictions, minimum issuance age requirements and certain limitations on the amount of contractholder purchase payments, as well as a required minimum allocation to our general account for certain of our products. We continue to introduce products that diversify our risk profile and have incorporated provisions in product design allowing frequent revisions of key pricing elements for certain of our products. In addition, there is diversity in our fee arrangements, as certain fees are primarily based on the benefit guarantee amount, the contractholder account value and/or premiums, which helps preserve certain revenue streams when market fluctuations cause account values to decline.\nii. Asset Liability Management Strategy (including fixed income instruments and derivatives):\nWe employ an ALM strategy that utilizes a combination of both traditional fixed income instruments and derivatives to help defray potential claims associated with our variable annuity living benefit guarantees. The economic liability we manage with this ALM strategy consists of expected living benefit claims under less severe market conditions, which are managed using fixed income and derivative instruments, and potential living benefit claims resulting from more severe market conditions, which are hedged using derivative instruments. For the portion of our ALM strategy executed with derivatives, we enter into a range of exchange-traded and over-the-counter (\"OTC\") equity, interest rate and credit derivatives, including, but not limited to: equity and treasury futures; total return, credit default and interest rate swaps; and options, including equity options, swaptions, and floors and caps. The intent of this strategy is to more efficiently manage the capital and liquidity associated with these products while continuing to mitigate fluctuations in net income due to movements in capital markets.\nThe valuation of the economic liability we seek to defray excludes certain items that are included within the U.S. GAAP liability, such as NPR in order to maximize protection irrespective of the possibility of our own default, as well as risk margins (required by U.S. GAAP but different from our best estimate) and valuation methodology differences. The following table provides a reconciliation between the liability reported under U.S. GAAP and the economic liability we manage through our ALM strategy as of the periods indicated:\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. GAAP liability (including NPR) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,905 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NPR adjustment </td> <td>522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,705 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Subtotal </td> <td>4,290 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,610 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments including risk margins and valuation methodology differences </td> <td>(1,331) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,596) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Economic liability managed through the ALM strategy </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fair value of our fixed income instruments and derivative assets exceed our economic liability.\nUnder our ALM strategy, we expect differences in the U.S. GAAP net income impact between the changes in value of the fixed income instruments (either designated as available-for-sale or designated as trading) and derivatives as compared to the changes in the embedded derivative liability these assets support. These differences can be primarily attributed to three distinct areas:\n\u2022Different valuation methodologies in measuring the liability we intend to cover with fixed income instruments and derivatives versus the liability reported under U.S. GAAP. The valuation methodology utilized in estimating the economic liability we intend to defray with fixed income instruments and derivatives is different from that required to be utilized to measure the liability under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the valuation of the economic liability excludes certain items that are included within the U.S. GAAP liability, such as NPR in order to maximize protection irrespective of the possibility of our own default and risk margins (required by U.S. GAAP but different from our best estimate).\n\u2022Different accounting treatment between liabilities and assets supporting those liabilities. Under U.S. GAAP, changes in fair value of the embedded derivative liability, derivative income and fixed income instruments designated as trading are immediately reflected in net income, while changes in the fair value of fixed income instruments that are designated as available-for-sale are recorded as unrealized gains (losses) in other comprehensive income.\n\u2022General hedge results. For the derivative portion of the ALM strategy, the net hedging impact (the extent to which the changes in value of the hedging instruments offset the change in value of the portion of the economic liability we are hedging) may be impacted by a number of factors, including: cash flow timing differences between our hedging instruments and the corresponding portion of the economic liability we are hedging, basis differences attributable to actual underlying contractholder funds to be hedged versus hedgeable indices, rebalancing costs related to dynamic rebalancing of hedging instruments as markets move, certain elements of the economic liability that may not be hedged (including certain actuarial assumptions), and implied and realized market volatility on the hedge positions relative to the portion of the economic liability we seek to hedge.\niii. Capital Hedge Program:\nWe employ a capital hedge program within the Company to protect a portion of the overall capital position of the variable annuities business against its exposure to the equity markets. The capital hedge program is conducted using equity derivatives which include equity call and put options, total return swaps and futures contracts.\nIncome Taxes\nThe differences between income taxes expected at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% applicable for 2021, 2020 and 2019, and the reported income tax expense (benefit) are provided in the following table:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected federal income tax expense (benefit) at federal statutory rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(847) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(269) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-taxable investment income </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax credits </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported income tax expense (benefit) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(866) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(291) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate </td> <td>20.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe effective tax rate is the ratio of Income tax expense (benefit)\u201d divided by Income before income taxes\u201d. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was 20.7%, 21.5% and 22.7%, respectively. For a detailed description of the nature of each significant reconciling item, see Note 11 to the Financial Statements. The change in the effective tax rate from 21.5% in 2020 to 20.7% in 2021 was primarily driven by the increase in pre-tax income. The change in the effective tax rate from 22.7% in 2019 to 21.5% in 2020 was primarily driven by the decrease in pre-tax income.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe Company's liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and interest that relate to tax years still subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. The completion of review or the expiration of the Federal statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the liability for income taxes. The Company had no unrecognized benefit as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. We do not anticipate any significant changes within the next 12 months to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired.\nIncome Tax Expense vs. Income Tax Paid in Cash\nIncome tax expense recorded under U.S. GAAP routinely differs from the income taxes paid in cash in any given year. Income tax expense recorded under U.S. GAAP is based on income reported in our Statements of Operations for the current period and it includes both current and deferred taxes. Income taxes paid during the year include tax installments made for the current year as well as tax payments and refunds related to prior periods.\nFor additional information on income tax related items, see Business-Regulation\u201d and Note 11 to the Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nLiquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the Company. Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operations of our business, fund business growth, and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our business, general economic conditions, our ability to borrow from affiliates and our access to the capital markets through affiliates as described herein.\nEffective and prudent liquidity and capital management is a priority across the organization. Management monitors the liquidity of the Company on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi-year time horizon. We use a Risk Appetite Framework ( RAF\u201d) to ensure that all risks taken by the Company align with our capacity and willingness to take those risks. The RAF provides a dynamic assessment of capital and liquidity stress impacts, including scenarios similar to, and more severe than, those occurring due to COVID-19, and is intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available to absorb those impacts. We believe that our capital and liquidity resources are sufficient to satisfy the capital and liquidity requirements of the Company.\nOur businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by domestic and international regulators. These regulations currently include requirements (many of which are the subject of ongoing rule-making) relating to capital, leverage, liquidity, stress-testing, overall risk management, credit exposure reporting and credit concentration. For information on these regulatory initiatives and their potential impact on us, see Business-Regulation\" and Risk Factors\".\nCapital\nWe manage PALAC to regulatory capital levels consistent with our AA\u201d ratings targets. We utilize the risk-based capital ( RBC\u201d) ratio as a primary measure of capital adequacy. RBC is calculated based on statutory financial statements and risk formulas consistent with the practices of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\"). RBC considers, among other things, risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with an insurer's products and liabilities, interest rate risks and general business risks. RBC ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring an insurer's solvency and ability to pay future claims. The reporting of RBC measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities, but is available to the public. The Company's capital levels substantially exceed the minimum level required by applicable insurance regulations. Our regulatory capital levels may be affected in the future by changes to the applicable regulations, proposals for which are currently under consideration by both domestic and international insurance regulators.\nThe regulatory capital level of the Company can be materially impacted by interest rate and equity market fluctuations, changes in the values of derivatives, the level of impairments recorded, and credit quality migration of the investment portfolio, among other items. In addition, the reinsurance of business or the recapture of business subject to reinsurance arrangements due to defaults by, or credit quality migration affecting, the reinsurers or for other reasons could negatively impact regulatory capital levels. The Company's regulatory capital level is also affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator.\nThe Company has returned capital to its parent, PAI, for the periods indicated below.\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Return of Capital </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>451 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,813 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>192 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2020 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>192 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2020 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>173 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2020 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>207 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity is managed to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations. Liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, as described more fully below, including portfolios of liquid assets. Our investment portfolios are integral to the overall liquidity of the Company. We use a projection process for cash flows from operations to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet projected cash outflows, including claims. The impact of Prudential Funding, LLC's (\"Prudential Funding\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, financing capacity on liquidity (as described below) is considered in the internal liquidity measures of the Company.\nLiquidity is measured against internally-developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support. We consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets (e.g., type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate our liquidity under various stress scenarios, including company-specific and market-wide events. We continue to believe that cash generated by ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios.\nThe principal sources of the Company's liquidity are premiums and certain annuity considerations, investment and fee income, investment maturities, sales of investments and internal borrowings. The principal uses of that liquidity include benefits, claims, and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders, withdrawals and net policy loan activity. Other uses of liquidity include commissions, general and administrative expenses, purchases of investments, the payment of dividends and returns of capital to the parent company, hedging and reinsurance activity and payments in connection with financing activities.\nIn managing liquidity, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. We use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent, timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers.\nLiquid Assets\nLiquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, U.S. Treasury fixed maturities, fixed maturities that are not designated as held-to-maturity, and public equity securities. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had liquid assets of $12 billion and $21 billion, respectively. The portion of liquid assets comprised cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was $3 billion and $1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, $8 billion, or 92%, of the fixed maturity investments in the Company's general account portfolios were rated high or highest quality based on NAIC or equivalent rating.\nFinancing Activities\nPrudential Funding, LLC\nPrudential Financial and Prudential Funding borrow funds in the capital markets primarily through the direct issuance of commercial paper. The borrowings serve as an additional source of financing to meet our working capital needs. Prudential Funding operates under a support agreement with Prudential Insurance whereby Prudential Insurance has agreed to maintain Prudential Funding's positive tangible net worth at all times.\nHedging activities associated with living benefit guarantees\nThe hedging portion of our risk management strategy associated with our living benefit guarantees is being managed within the Company. For the portion of the risk management strategy executed through hedging, we enter into a range of exchange-traded, cleared and other OTC equity and interest rate derivatives in order to hedge certain living benefit guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives against changes in certain capital market risks above a designated threshold. The portion of the risk management strategy comprising the hedging portion requires access to liquidity to meet the Company's payment obligations relating to these derivatives, such as payments for periodic settlements, purchases, maturities and terminations. These liquidity needs can vary materially due to, among other items, changes in interest rates, equity markets, mortality and policyholder behavior.\nThe hedging portion of the risk management strategy may also result in derivative-related collateral postings to (when we are in a net pay position) or from (when we are in a net receive position) counterparties. The net collateral position depends on changes in interest rates and equity markets related to the amount of the exposures hedged. Depending on market conditions, the collateral posting requirements can result in material liquidity needs when we are in a net pay position.", "item_7_truncated": "\u2022 investment-related activity, including: investment income returns, net interest margins, net investment spread results,\nAmortization methodologies\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected federal income tax expense (benefit) at federal statutory rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(847) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(269) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-taxable investment income </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax credits </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported income tax expense (benefit) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(866) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(291) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate </td> <td>20.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPartially offset by:\nFuture Policy Benefit Reserves\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Return of Capital </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>451 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,813 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2021 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>192 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2020 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>192 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2020 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>173 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2020 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>207 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndustry Trends\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in millions)(1) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. GAAP embedded derivative and hedging positions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in value of U.S.GAAP liability, pre-NPR(2) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,904) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in the NPR adjustment </td> <td>(945) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>520 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of hedge assets, excluding capital hedges(3) </td> <td>(3,224) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,077 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of capital hedges(4) </td> <td>(900) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(921) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 Variable Annuities Recapture Impact </td> <td>5,142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>1,201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,622 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments </td> <td>7,026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,606) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market experience updates(5) </td> <td>180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(96) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charges related to realized investments gains (losses), net </td> <td>(215) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net impact from changes in the U.S. GAAP embedded derivative and hedge positions, after the impact of NPR, DAC and other costs(6) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,631) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe manage PALAC to regulatory capital levels consistent with our AA\u201d ratings targets.

RBC is calculated based on statutory financial statements and risk formulas consistent with the practices of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\"). RBC considers, among other things, risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with an insurer's products and liabilities, interest rate risks and general business risks. RBC ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring an insurer's solvency and ability to pay future claims. The reporting of RBC measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities, but is available to the public. The Company's capital levels substantially exceed the minimum level required by applicable insurance regulations. Our regulatory capital levels may be affected in the future by changes to the applicable regulations, proposals for which are currently under consideration by both domestic and international insurance regulators.\nTable 9: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Increase (Decrease) in </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs, Deferred Sales Inducements and Value of Business Acquired </td> <td> </td> <td>Reinsurance Recoverables </td> <td> </td> <td>Future Policy Benefits and Policyholders' Account Balances </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Impact </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hypothetical change in current assumptions: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 25 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 25 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term equity expected rate of return </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 50 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 50 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NPR credit spread </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 50 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(90) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(30) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(390) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>270 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 50 basis points </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(290) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortality </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 1% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(40) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 1% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lapse </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase by 10% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(120) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease by 10% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(105) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\ni.

Management, on an ongoing basis, reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements. If management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances, the Company's results of operations and financial position as reported in the Financial Statements could change significantly.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nIncome Tax Expense vs. Income Tax Paid in Cash\n(3)Represents the changes in fair value of the derivatives utilized to hedge potential claims associated with our variable annuity living benefit guarantees.\nThe CARES Act. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) was enacted into law. One provision of the CARES Act amends the Tax Act of 2017 and allows companies with net operating losses ( NOLs\u201d) originating in 2020, 2019 or 2018 to carry back those losses for up to five years. The Company has generated taxable income in 2020. Therefore, there is no impact from the change in law for NOL carry back to tax years that have a 35% tax rate.\nThe Company's liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and interest that relate to tax years still subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. The completion of review or the expiration of the Federal statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the liability for income taxes. The Company had no unrecognized benefit as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. We do not anticipate any significant changes within the next 12 months to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired.\nEffective December 1, 2021, the Company entered into a reinsurance agreement with Pruco Life under which the Company reinsured all of its variable and fixed indexed annuities and fixed annuities with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal income feature to Pruco Life.\n\u2022For certain contract features, such as those related to guaranteed minimum death benefits ( GMDB\u201d) and guaranteed minimum income benefits ( GMIB\u201d), a liability is established when associated assessments (which include policy charges for administration, mortality, expense, surrender, and other, regardless of how characterized) are recognized. This liability is established using current best estimate assumptions and is based on the ratio of the present value of total expected excess payments (e.g., payments in excess of account value) over the life of the contract divided by the present value of total expected assessments (i.e., benefit ratio). The liability equals the current benefit ratio multiplied by cumulative assessments recognized to date, plus interest, less cumulative excess payments to date. The result of the benefit ratio method is that the liability at any point in time represents an accumulation of the portion of assessments received to date expected to be needed to fund future excess payments, less any excess payments already paid. The liability does not necessarily reflect the full policyholder obligation the Company expects to pay at the conclusion of the contract since a portion of that excess payment would be funded by assessments received in the future and would be recognized in the liability at that time. Similar to as described above for DAC, the reserves are subject to adjustments based on annual reviews of assumptions and quarterly adjustments for experience, including market performance. These adjustments reflect the impact on the benefit ratio of using actual historical experience from the issuance date to the balance sheet date plus updated estimates of future experience. The updated benefit ratio is then applied to all prior periods' assessments to derive an adjustment to the reserve recognized through a benefit or charge to current period earnings.\nThe following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.\nThe Company has returned capital to its parent, PAI, for the periods indicated below.\nRevenues, Benefits and Expenses\nChanges in Financial Position\nVariable Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants. The primary risk exposures of our variable annuity contracts relate to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including capital markets assumptions such as equity market returns, interest rates and market volatility, along with actuarial assumptions such as contractholder mortality, the timing and amount of annuitization and withdrawals, and contract lapses. For these risk exposures, achievement of our expected returns is subject to the risk that actual experience will differ from the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products. We manage our exposure to certain risks driven by fluctuations in capital markets primarily through a combination of i) Product Design Features, ii) our Asset Liability Management Strategy, and iii) our Capital Hedge Program as discussed below.\n\u2022CARES Act and Other Regulatory Developments. See \"Business-Regulation\" for additional information.\nIndexed Variable Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants. The primary risk exposure of our indexed variable annuity products relates to the investment risks we bear in order to credit to the customer's account balance the required crediting rate based on the performance of the elected indices at the end of each term. We manage this risk primarily through our investment strategies including derivatives and product design features, which include credit rate resetting subject to contractual minimums as well as surrender charges applied during the early years of the contract that help to provide protection for premature withdrawals. In addition, our indexed variable annuity strategies have an interim value provision that provides protection from lapse in the case of rising interest rates. We also manage these risk exposures through affiliated reinsurance. For information on our affiliated reinsurance agreements, see Business-Reinsurance\u201d section and Note 14 to the Financial Statements.\nCapital\n\u2022policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity.\nAn increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by one percentage point would have resulted in a decrease or increase in our 2021 \"Income tax expense (benefit)\" of $63 million.\nFor equity method investments, the carrying value of these investments is written down or impaired to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary.

Interest rates in the U.S. have experienced a sustained period of historically low levels, which continue to negatively impact our investment-related activity, including our investment income returns, net investment spread results, and portfolio income and reinvestment yields. See Impact of a Low Interest Rate Environment\u201d below. In addition, we are subject to financial impacts associated with movements in equity markets and the evolution of the credit cycle as discussed in Risk Factors\u201d.\n\u2022$7.4 billion increase in Reinsurance recoverables driven by the new reinsurance with Pruco Life; and\nSensitivities for Insurance Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table illustrates the net impact on our results of operations from changes in the U.S. GAAP embedded derivative liability and hedge positions under the Asset Liability Management (\"ALM\") strategy, and the related amortization of DAC and other costs, for the periods indicated:\n\u2022For life contingent payout annuities, we utilize a net premium valuation methodology in measuring the liability for future policy benefits. Under this methodology, a liability for future policy benefits is accrued when premium revenue is recognized. The liability, which represents the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums (portion of the gross premium required to provide for all benefits and expenses), is estimated using methods that include assumptions applicable at the time the insurance contracts are made with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as appropriate. Original assumptions continue to be used in subsequent accounting periods to determine changes in the liability for future policy benefits (often referred to as the lock-in concept\u201d), unless a premium deficiency exists. The result of the net premium valuation methodology is that the liability at any point in time represents an accumulation of the portion of premiums received to date expected to be needed to fund future benefits (i.e., net premiums received to date), less any benefits and expenses already paid. The liability does not necessarily reflect the full policyholder obligation the Company expects to pay at the conclusion of the contract since a portion of that obligation would be funded by net premiums received in the future and would be recognized in the liability at that time. We perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation. If the liabilities determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net reserves (i.e., GAAP reserves net of any DAC, DSI or VOBA asset), the existing net reserves are adjusted by first reducing these assets by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings. If the deficiency is more than these asset balances for insurance contracts, we then increase the net reserves by the excess, again through a charge to current period earnings. If a premium deficiency is recognized, the assumptions as of the premium deficiency test date are locked-in and used in subsequent valuations and the net reserves continue to be subject to premium deficiency testing. In addition, for limited-payment contracts, future policy benefit reserves also include a deferred profit liability representing gross premiums received in excess of net premiums. The deferred profits are generally recognized in revenue in a constant relationship with insurance in force or with the amount of expected future benefit payments.\nFor additional information on income tax related items, see Business-Regulation\u201d and Note 11 to the Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\n\u2022General hedge results. For the derivative portion of the ALM strategy, the net hedging impact (the extent to which the changes in value of the hedging instruments offset the change in value of the portion of the economic liability we are hedging) may be impacted by a number of factors, including: cash flow timing differences between our hedging instruments and the corresponding portion of the economic liability we are hedging, basis differences attributable to actual underlying contractholder funds to be hedged versus hedgeable indices, rebalancing costs related to dynamic rebalancing of hedging instruments as markets move, certain elements of the economic liability that may not be hedged (including certain actuarial assumptions), and implied and realized market volatility on the hedge positions relative to the portion of the economic liability we seek to hedge.\n\u2022Different valuation methodologies in measuring the liability we intend to cover with fixed income instruments and derivatives versus the liability reported under U.S. GAAP. The valuation methodology utilized in estimating the economic liability we intend to defray with fixed income instruments and derivatives is different from that required to be utilized to measure the liability under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the valuation of the economic liability excludes certain items that are included within the U.S. GAAP liability, such as NPR in order to maximize protection irrespective of the possibility of our own default and risk margins (required by U.S. GAAP but different from our best estimate).\n\u2022Results of Operations.

We use a Risk Appetite Framework ( RAF\u201d) to ensure that all risks taken by the Company align with our capacity and willingness to take those risks. The RAF provides a dynamic assessment of capital and liquidity stress impacts, including scenarios similar to, and more severe than, those occurring due to COVID-19, and is intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available to absorb those impacts. We believe that our capital and liquidity resources are sufficient to satisfy the capital and liquidity requirements of the Company.\nThe following table summarizes the impact that could result on each of the listed financial statement balances from changes in certain key assumptions. The information below is for illustrative purposes and includes only the hypothetical direct impact on December 31, 2021 balances of changes in a single assumption and not changes in any combination of assumptions. Additionally, the illustration of the insurance assumption impacts below reflects a parallel shift in the insurance assumptions; however, these may be non-parallel in practice. Changes in current assumptions could result in impacts to financial statement balances that are in excess of the amounts illustrated. A description of the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of each of these financial statement balances is provided above. For traditional long-duration and limited-payment contracts, U.S. GAAP requires the original assumptions used when the contracts are issued to be locked-in and that those assumptions be used in all future liability calculations as long as the resulting liabilities are adequate to provide for the future benefits and expenses (i.e., there is no premium deficiency). Therefore, these products are not reflected in the sensitivity table below unless the hypothetical change in assumption would result in an adverse impact that would cause a premium deficiency. Similarly, the impact of any favorable change in assumptions for traditional long-duration and limited-payment contracts is not reflected in the table below given that the current assumption is required to remain locked-in and instead the positive impacts would be recognized into net income over the life of the policies in force.\nThe following paragraphs provide additional details about the reserves we have established:\nnew money rates, mortgage loan prepayments and bond redemptions;\n\u2022$7.0 billion increase in Reinsurance payables driven by the new reinsurance with Pruco Life; and\nOur business is impacted by financial markets, economic conditions, regulatory oversight, and a variety of trends that affect the industries where we compete.\nThe hedging portion of the risk management strategy may also result in derivative-related collateral postings to (when we are in a net pay position) or from (when we are in a net receive position) counterparties. The net collateral position depends on changes in interest rates and equity markets related to the amount of the exposures hedged. Depending on market conditions, the collateral posting requirements can result in material liquidity needs when we are in a net pay position.\nWe capitalize costs that are directly related to the acquisition of annuity contracts. These costs primarily include commissions, as well as costs of policy issuance and underwriting and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully negotiated contracts. We have also deferred costs associated with sales inducements offered in the past related to our variable and fixed annuity contracts. Sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the policyholders' account balances mainly as an inducement to purchase the contract. For additional information about sales inducements, see Note 9 to the Financial Statements. We generally amortize DAC and DSI over the expected lives of the contracts, based on our estimates of the level and timing of gross profits. As described in more detail below, in calculating DAC and DSI amortization we are required to make assumptions about investment returns, mortality, persistency, and other items that impact our estimates of the level and timing of gross profits. We also periodically evaluate the recoverability of our DAC and DSI. For certain contracts, this evaluation is performed as part of our premium deficiency testing, as discussed further below in Insurance Liabilities-Future Policy Benefits\". As of December 31, 2021, DAC and DSI were $567 million and $295 million, respectively.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nInsurance Liabilities\nPolicyholders' account balances liability represents the contract value that has accrued to the benefit of the policyholder as of the balance sheet date. This liability is primarily associated with the accumulated account deposits, plus interest credited, less policyholder withdrawals and other charges assessed against the account balance, as applicable. The liability also includes provisions for benefits under non-life contingent payout annuities. Policyholders' account balances also include amounts representing the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with the index-linked features of certain annuity products. For additional information regarding the valuation of these embedded derivatives, see Note 5 to the Financial Statements.\nThe differences between income taxes expected at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% applicable for 2021, 2020 and 2019, and the reported income tax expense (benefit) are provided in the following table:\n\u2022product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix; and\n\u2022$1.9 billion increase in Other assets driven by the new reinsurance with Pruco Life.\nEffective Tax Rate\nTotal assets decreased $5.7 billion from $64.3 billion at December 31, 2020 to $58.6 billion at December 31, 2021. Significant components were:\nThe valuation of the economic liability we seek to defray excludes certain items that are included within the U.S. GAAP liability, such as NPR in order to maximize protection irrespective of the possibility of our own default, as well as risk margins (required by U.S. GAAP but different from our best estimate) and valuation methodology differences. The following table provides a reconciliation between the liability reported under U.S. GAAP and the economic liability we manage through our ALM strategy as of the periods indicated:\nThe quarterly adjustments for current period experience referred to above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for a given period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for that period. To the extent each period's actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period, the assumed level of total gross profits may change. In these cases, we recognize a cumulative adjustment to all previous periods' amortization, also referred to as an experience true-up adjustment.\nTaxes on Income\nSale of PALAC\nOur liquidity is managed to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations. Liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, as described more fully below, including portfolios of liquid assets. Our investment portfolios are integral to the overall liquidity of the Company. We use a projection process for cash flows from operations to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet projected cash outflows, including claims. The impact of Prudential Funding, LLC's (\"Prudential Funding\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, financing capacity on liquidity (as described below) is considered in the internal liquidity measures of the Company.\nThe Company has sold a wide array of annuities, including deferred and immediate variable annuities with (1) fixed interest rate allocation options, subject to a market value adjustment, that are registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d), and (2) fixed-rate allocation options subject to a limited market value adjustment or no market value adjustment and not registered with the SEC. The Company ceased offering these products in March 2010. In 2018, the Company resumed offering annuity products to new investors (except in New York). For more information on products, see \"Item 1 Business-Products\".\nOur effective tax rate is based on income, non-taxable and non-deductible items, tax credits, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. The Dividend Received Deduction ( DRD\u201d) is a major reason for the difference between the Company's effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate. The DRD is an estimate that incorporates the prior and current year information, as well as the current year's equity market performance. Both the current estimate of the DRD and the DRD in future periods can vary based on factors such as, but not limited to, changes in the amount of dividends received that are eligible for the DRD, changes in the amount of distributions received from underlying fund investments, changes in the account balances of variable life and annuity contracts, and the Company's taxable income before the DRD.\nWe also regularly evaluate and adjust the related DAC and DSI balances with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the impact of actual gross profits and changes in our projections of estimated future gross profits on our DAC and DSI amortization rates. Adjustments to the DAC and DSI balances include the impact to our estimate of total gross profits of the annual review of assumptions, our quarterly adjustments for current period experience, and our quarterly adjustments for market performance. Each of these adjustments is further discussed below in -Annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments\u201d.\nThe regulatory capital level of the Company can be materially impacted by interest rate and equity market fluctuations, changes in the values of derivatives, the level of impairments recorded, and credit quality migration of the investment portfolio, among other items. In addition, the reinsurance of business or the recapture of business subject to reinsurance arrangements due to defaults by, or credit quality migration affecting, the reinsurers or for other reasons could negatively impact regulatory capital levels. The Company's regulatory capital level is also affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator.\nOur investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities, other invested assets and derivative financial instruments. Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or the values of securities. Derivative financial instruments we generally use include swaps, futures, forwards and options and may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) market. We are also party to financial instruments that contain derivative instruments that are embedded\u201d in the financial instruments. Management believes the following accounting policies related to investments, including derivatives, are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. Each of these policies is discussed further within other relevant disclosures related to investments and derivatives, as referenced below:\nIncome (loss) from operations before income taxes increased $10.3 billion from a loss of $4.0 billion in 2020 to a gain of $6.3 billion in 2021. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, income from operations increased $10.4 billion primarily driven by:\n\u2022 customer account values, including their impact on fee income;\n\n2021 to 2020 Annual Comparison\nLiquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, U.S. Treasury fixed maturities, fixed maturities that are not designated as held-to-maturity, and public equity securities. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had liquid assets of $12 billion and $21 billion, respectively. The portion of liquid assets comprised cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was $3 billion and $1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, $8 billion, or 92%, of the fixed maturity investments in the Company's general account portfolios were rated high or highest quality based on NAIC or equivalent rating.\nWe believe we can sustain long-term remote work and social distancing while ensuring that critical business operations are sustained. In addition, we are managing COVID-19-related impacts on third-party provided services, and do not anticipate significant interruption in critical operations.\nA portion of the variable annuity contracts that we offer include an asset transfer feature. This feature is implemented at the contract level, and transfers assets between certain variable investment sub-accounts selected by the annuity contractholder and, depending on the benefit feature, a fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond fund sub-account within the separate account. The objective of the asset transfer feature is to reduce our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility. The transfers are based on a static mathematical formula used with the particular benefit which considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the impact of investment performance on the contractholder's total account value. Other product design features we utilize include, among others, asset allocation restrictions, minimum issuance age requirements and certain limitations on the amount of contractholder purchase payments, as well as a required minimum allocation to our general account for certain of our products. We continue to introduce products that diversify our risk profile and have incorporated provisions in product design allowing frequent revisions of key pricing elements for certain of our products. In addition, there is diversity in our fee arrangements, as certain fees are primarily based on the benefit guarantee amount, the contractholder account value and/or premiums, which helps preserve certain revenue streams when market fluctuations cause account values to decline.\nFor 2021, the gain of $7.0 billion primarily reflected favorable impacts related to the portions of the U.S. GAAP liability before NPR that are excluded from the hedge target driven by rising interest rates and favorable equity markets and the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture impact, partially offset by changes in fair value of hedge assets and capital hedges driven by rising interest rates and favorable equity markets and unfavorable NPR adjustment.\nA contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events. Under U.S. GAAP, accruals for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated, such as in connection with an unresolved legal matter. The initial reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and, ultimately, when the matter is brought to closure.\n\nPartially offset by:\nRisks and Risk Mitigants\nii. Asset Liability Management Strategy (including fixed income instruments and derivatives):\n\u2022Different accounting treatment between liabilities and assets supporting those liabilities. Under U.S. GAAP, changes in fair value of the embedded derivative liability, derivative income and fixed income instruments designated as trading are immediately reflected in net income, while changes in the fair value of fixed income instruments that are designated as available-for-sale are recorded as unrealized gains (losses) in other comprehensive income.\nThe weighted average rate of return assumptions used in developing estimated market returns consider many factors specific to each product type, including asset durations, asset allocations and other factors. With regard to equity market assumptions, the near-term future rate of return assumption used in evaluating DAC, DSI and VOBA and liabilities for future policy benefits for certain of our products, primarily our domestic variable annuity products, is generally updated each quarter and is derived using a reversion to the mean approach, a common industry practice. Under this approach, we consider historical equity returns and adjust projected equity returns over an initial future period of five years (the near-term\u201d) so that equity returns converge to the long-term expected rate of return. If the near-term projected future rate of return is greater than our near-term maximum future rate of return of 15.0%, we use our maximum future rate of return. If the near-term projected future rate of return is lower than our near-term minimum future rate of return of 0%, we use our minimum future rate of return. As of December 31, 2021, we assume an 8.0% long-term equity expected rate of return and a 0.0% near-term mean reversion equity expected rate of return.\niii. Capital Hedge Program:\nIn addition to DAC and DSI, we also recognize an asset for value of business acquired, or VOBA, which is an intangible asset that represents an adjustment to the stated value of acquired in-force insurance contract liabilities to present them at fair value, determined as of the acquisition date. VOBA is amortized over the expected life of the acquired contracts using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC and DSI (see -Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Deferred Sales Inducements\u201d above for additional information). VOBA is also subject to recoverability testing. As of December 31, 2021, VOBA was $28 million.\nIn managing liquidity, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. We use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent, timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers.\n\u2022Recognition of other-than-temporary impairments (\"OTTI\") for equity method investments.\nValue of Business Acquired\nIncome tax expense recorded under U.S. GAAP routinely differs from the income taxes paid in cash in any given year. Income tax expense recorded under U.S. GAAP is based on income reported in our Statements of Operations for the current period and it includes both current and deferred taxes. Income taxes paid during the year include tax installments made for the current year as well as tax payments and refunds related to prior periods.\nThe reserves for future policy benefits of our business relate to reserves for the GMDB and GMIB features of our variable annuities, and for the optional living benefit features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives. As discussed above, in establishing reserves for GMDBs and GMIBs, we utilize current best estimate assumptions. The primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves generally include annuitization, lapse, withdrawal and mortality assumptions, as well as interest rate and equity market return assumptions. Lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on the in-the-moneyness of the benefit and reflect other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. Lapse rates are reduced when contracts are more in-the-money. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower for the period where surrender charges apply. For life contingent payout annuity contracts, we establish reserves using best estimate assumptions with provisions for adverse deviations as of inception or best estimate assumptions as of the most recent loss recognition date.\n\u2022fair value of, and possible impairments, on intangible assets;\nEffective July 1, 2021, Pruco Life recaptured the risks related to its business that had previously been reinsured to the Company from April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2021. The recapture does not impact PLNJ, which will continue to reinsure its new and in force business to Prudential Insurance. The product risks related to the previously reinsured business that were being managed in the Company, were transferred to Pruco Life. In addition, the living benefit hedging program related to the previously reinsured living benefit riders are being managed within Pruco Life. For more information on this transaction, see Note 1 to the Financial Statements.\nFuture Policy Benefits\nCOVID-19\nThe assumptions used in establishing reserves are generally based on the Company's experience, industry experience and/or other factors, as applicable. We update our actuarial assumptions, such as mortality and policyholder behavior assumptions annually, unless a material change is observed in an interim period that we feel is indicative of a long-term trend. Generally, we do not expect trends to change significantly in the short-term and, to the extent these trends may change, we expect such changes to be gradual over the long-term. In a sustained low interest rate environment, there is an increased likelihood that the reserves determined based on best estimate assumptions may be greater than the net liabilities.\nIncome (loss) from Operations before Income Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fair value of our fixed income instruments and derivative assets exceed our economic liability.\nPrudential Funding, LLC\nThe impacts presented within this table exclude the related impacts of our asset liability management strategy, which seeks to offset the changes in the balances presented within this table and is primarily composed of investments and derivatives. See further below for a discussion of the estimates and assumptions involved with the application of U.S. GAAP accounting policies for these instruments and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d for hypothetical impacts on related balances as a result of changes in certain significant assumptions.\nTotal liabilities decreased by $4.6 billion from $61.5 billion at December 31, 2020 to $56.9 billion at December 31, 2021. Significant components were:\nWe present at fair value in the statements of financial position our debt security investments classified as available-for-sale, investments classified as trading, and certain fixed maturities, equity securities, and certain investments within Other invested assets,\u201d such as derivatives. For additional information regarding the key estimates and assumptions surrounding the determination of fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities, as well as derivative instruments, embedded derivatives and other investments, see Note 5 to the Financial Statements.\n(4)Represents the changes in fair value of equity derivatives of the capital hedge program intended to protect a portion of the overall capital position of our business against exposure to the equity markets.\nAccounting Policies & Pronouncements\nEffective July 1, 2021, Pruco Life Insurance Company ( Pruco Life\u201d) recaptured the risks related to its business, as discussed above, that had previously been reinsured to the Company from April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2021. The recapture does not impact Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey ( PLNJ\u201d), which will continue to reinsure its new and in force business to The Prudential Insurance Company of America ( Prudential Insurance\u201d). The product risks related to the previously reinsured business that were being managed in the Company, were transferred to Pruco Life. In addition, the living benefit hedging program related to the previously reinsured living benefit riders are being managed within Pruco Life. This transaction is referred to as the \"2021 Variable Annuities Recapture\".\nWe establish reserves for future policy benefits to, or on behalf of, policyholders, using methodologies prescribed by U.S. GAAP. The reserving methodologies used include the following:\n\u2022$10.4 billion decrease in Total investments and Cash and cash equivalents primarily driven by consideration paid related to the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture and new reinsurance with Pruco Life and dividend distributions;\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022 insurance reserve levels, market experience true-ups and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (\"DAC\")/value of business acquired ( VOBA\u201d)/deferred sales inducements (\"DSI\");\nFor 2020, the loss of $2.6 billion primarily reflected unfavorable impacts related to the portions of the U.S. GAAP liability before NPR that are excluded from the hedge target, partially offset by changes in fair value of hedge assets driven by declining interest rates.\nFixed Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants. The primary risk exposure of our fixed annuity products relates to investment risks we bear for providing customers a minimum guaranteed interest rate or an index-linked interest rate required to be credited to the customer's account value, which include interest rate fluctuations and/or sustained periods of low interest rates, and credit risk related to the underlying investments. We manage these risk exposures primarily through our investment strategies and product design features, which include credit rate resetting subject to the minimum guaranteed interest rate, as well as surrender charges applied during the early years of the contract that help to provide protection for premature withdrawals. In addition, a portion of our fixed annuity products has a market value adjustment provision that affords protection of lapse in the case of rising interest rates. We also manage these risk exposures through affiliated reinsurance. For information on our affiliated reinsurance agreements, see Business-Reinsurance\u201d section and Note 14 to the Financial Statements.\n\u2022For certain product guarantees, primarily certain optional living benefit features of the variable annuity products including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ( GMAB\u201d), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ( GMWB\u201d) and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits ( GMIWB\u201d), the benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives using a fair value accounting framework. The fair value of these contracts is calculated as the present value of expected future benefit payments to contractholders less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. Under U.S. GAAP, the fair values of these benefit features are based on assumptions a market participant would use in valuing these embedded derivatives. Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives are recorded quarterly through a benefit or charge to current period earnings. For additional information regarding the valuation of these embedded derivatives, see Note 5 to the Financial Statements.\nSince the first quarter of 2020, the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) has caused extreme stress and disruption in the global economy and financial markets, and elevated mortality and morbidity for the global population. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our results of operations in the current period and is expected to impact our results of operations in future periods.\nASU 2018-12 will impact, at least to some extent, the accounting and disclosure requirements for all long-duration insurance and investment contracts issued by the Company. The Company expects the standard to have a significant financial impact on the Financial Statements and will significantly enhance disclosures. In addition to the significant impacts to the balance sheet upon adoption, the Company also expects an impact to the pattern of earnings emergence following the transition date. See Note 2 to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of ASU 2018-12, as well as other accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted and newly adopted accounting pronouncements.\nWe employ a capital hedge program within the Company to protect a portion of the overall capital position of the variable annuities business against its exposure to the equity markets. The capital hedge program is conducted using equity derivatives which include equity call and put options, total return swaps and futures contracts.\nFinancing Activities\n\u2022Significant Realized investment gains (losses), reflecting a favorable impact to the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture and portions of the U.S. GAAP liability before NPR, that are excluded from our hedge target driven by favorable equity market performance and rising interest rates.\nOverview\n\u2022Valuation of investments, including derivatives;\nRevenues and Expenses\n\n\u2022$2.6 billion increase in Policyholders' account balances primarily driven by incremental general account product sales.\nLiquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the Company. Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operations of our business, fund business growth, and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our business, general economic conditions, our ability to borrow from affiliates and our access to the capital markets through affiliates as described herein.\n(2)Represents the change in the liability (excluding NPR) for our variable annuities which is measured utilizing a valuation methodology that is required under U.S. GAAP. This liability includes such items as risk margins which are required by U.S. GAAP but not included in our best estimate of the liability.\nUnder our ALM strategy, we expect differences in the U.S. GAAP net income impact between the changes in value of the fixed income instruments (either designated as available-for-sale or designated as trading) and derivatives as compared to the changes in the embedded derivative liability these assets support. These differences can be primarily attributed to three distinct areas:\nThe quarterly adjustments for market performance referred to above reflect the impact of changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance and market conditions. A significant portion of gross profits for our variable annuity contracts is dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options. This rate of return influences the fees we earn on variable annuity contracts, costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts, as well as other sources of profit. Returns that are higher than our expectations for a given period produce higher than expected account balances, which increase the future fees we expect to earn on variable annuity contracts and decrease the future costs we expect to incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts. The opposite occurs when returns are lower than our expectations. The changes in future expected gross profits are used to recognize a cumulative adjustment to all prior periods' amortization.\n\u2022Business Continuity. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been executing Prudential Financial's and our business continuity protocols to ensure our employees are safe and able to serve our customers. This included effectively transitioning the vast majority of our employees to remote work arrangements in 2020 and 2021.\nWe generally amortize DAC and other costs over the expected life of the policies in proportion to total gross profits. Total gross profits include both actual gross profits and estimates of gross profits for future periods. Gross profits are defined as (i) amounts assessed for mortality, contract administration, surrender charges, and other assessments plus amounts earned from investment of policyholder balances, less (ii) benefits in excess of policyholder balances, costs incurred for contract administration, the net cost of reinsurance for certain products, interest credited to policyholder balances and other credits. If significant negative gross profits are expected in any periods, the amount of insurance in force is generally substituted as the base for computing amortization. U.S. GAAP gross profits and amortization rates also include the impacts of the embedded derivatives associated with certain of the optional living benefit features of our variable annuity contracts and indexed annuity contracts and related hedging activities. In calculating amortization expense, we estimate the amounts of gross profits that will be included in our U.S. GAAP results, and utilize these estimates to calculate distinct amortization rates and expense amounts. In addition, in calculating gross profits, we include the profits and losses related to contracts previously issued by the Company that are reported in affiliated legal entities other than the Company as a result of, for example, reinsurance agreements with those affiliated entities. The Company is an indirect subsidiary of Prudential Financial (an SEC registrant) and has extensive transactions and relationships with other subsidiaries of Prudential Financial, including reinsurance agreements, as discussed in Note 10 and Note 14 to the Financial Statements. Incorporating all product-related profits and losses in gross profits, including those that are reported in affiliated legal entities, produces an amortization pattern representative of the total economics of the products. For a further discussion of the amortization of DAC and other costs, see -Results of Operations\u201d.\nImpact of a Low Interest Rate Environment\nThe Company was established in 1969 and has been a provider of annuity contracts for the individual market in the United States. The Company's products have been sold primarily to individuals to provide for long-term savings and retirement needs and to address the economic impact of premature death, estate planning concerns and supplemental retirement income.\nInsurance Assets\nWe employ an ALM strategy that utilizes a combination of both traditional fixed income instruments and derivatives to help defray potential claims associated with our variable annuity living benefit guarantees. The economic liability we manage with this ALM strategy consists of expected living benefit claims under less severe market conditions, which are managed using fixed income and derivative instruments, and potential living benefit claims resulting from more severe market conditions, which are hedged using derivative instruments. For the portion of our ALM strategy executed with derivatives, we enter into a range of exchange-traded and over-the-counter (\"OTC\") equity, interest rate and credit derivatives, including, but not limited to: equity and treasury futures; total return, credit default and interest rate swaps; and options, including equity options, swaptions, and floors and caps. The intent of this strategy is to more efficiently manage the capital and liquidity associated with these products while continuing to mitigate fluctuations in net income due to movements in capital markets.\nContingencies\nValuation of Investments, Including Derivatives, Measurement of Allowance for Credit Loss, and the Recognition of Other-than-Temporary Impairments\nDemographics. Customer demographics continue to evolve and new opportunities present themselves in different consumer segments such as the millennial and multicultural markets. Consumer expectations and preferences are changing. We believe existing customers and potential customers are increasingly looking for cost-effective solutions that they can easily understand and access through technology-enabled devices. At the same time, income protection, wealth accumulation and the needs of retiring baby boomers are continuing to shape the insurance industry. A persistent retirement security gap exists in terms of both savings and protection. Despite the ongoing phenomenon of the risk and responsibility of retirement savings shifting from employers to employees, employers are becoming increasingly focused on the financial wellness of the individuals they employ.\nCompetitive Environment. See Business\u201d for a discussion of the competitive environment and the basis on which we compete.\nWe perform an annual comprehensive review of the assumptions used in estimating gross profits for future periods. Over the last several years, the Company's most significant assumption updates that have resulted in a change to expected future gross profits and the amortization of DAC, DSI and VOBA have been related to lapse and other contractholder behavior assumptions, mortality, and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments. These assumptions may also cause potential significant variability in amortization expense in the future. The impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.\nASU 2018-12, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) on August 15, 2018 and was amended by ASU 2019-09, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Effective Date, issued in October 2019 and ASU 2020-11, Financial Services-Insurance (Topic 944): Effective Date and Early Application, issued in November 2020. Large calendar-year public companies that early adopt ASU 2018-12 are allowed to apply the guidance either as of January 1, 2020 or January 1, 2021 (and record transition adjustments as of January 1, 2020 or January 1, 2021, respectively) in the 2022 financial statements. Companies that do not early adopt ASU 2018-12 would apply the guidance as of January 1, 2021 (and record transition adjustments as of January 1, 2021) in the 2023 financial statements. The Company will adopt ASU 2018-12 using the modified retrospective transition method where permitted.\nThe effective tax rate is the ratio of Income tax expense (benefit)\u201d divided by Income before income taxes\u201d. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was 20.7%, 21.5% and 22.7%, respectively. For a detailed description of the nature of each significant reconciling item, see Note 11 to the Financial Statements. The change in the effective tax rate from 21.5% in 2020 to 20.7% in 2021 was primarily driven by the increase in pre-tax income. The change in the effective tax rate from 22.7% in 2019 to 21.5% in 2020 was primarily driven by the decrease in pre-tax income.\nFor more information on interest rate risks, see \"Risk Factors-Market Risk\".\n\n(1)Positive amount represents income; negative amount represents a loss.\nThe reserves for certain optional living benefit features, including GMAB, GMWB and GMIWB are accounted for as embedded derivatives at fair value, as described above. This methodology could result in either a liability or contra-liability balance, given changing capital market conditions and various actuarial assumptions. Since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations, the valuations are calculated using internally-developed models with option pricing techniques. The models are based on a risk neutral valuation framework and incorporate premiums for risks inherent in valuation techniques, inputs, and the general uncertainty around the timing and amount of future cash flows. The significant inputs to the valuation models for these embedded derivatives include capital market assumptions, such as interest rate levels and volatility assumptions, the Company's market-perceived risk of its own non-performance risk ( NPR\u201d), as well as actuarially determined assumptions, including mortality rates and contractholder behavior, such as lapse rates, benefit utilization rates and withdrawal rates. Capital market inputs and actual contractholders' account values are updated each quarter based on capital market conditions as of the end of the quarter, including interest rates, equity markets and volatility. In the risk neutral valuation, the initial swap curve drives the total returns used to grow the contractholders' account values. The Company's discount rate assumption is based on the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) swap curve adjusted for an additional spread, which includes an estimate of NPR. Actuarial assumptions, including contractholder behavior and mortality, are reviewed at least annually and updated based upon emerging experience, future expectations and other data, including any observable market data, such as available industry studies or market transactions such as acquisitions and reinsurance transactions. For additional information regarding the valuation of these optional living benefit features, see Note 5 to the Financial Statements.\nThe principal sources of the Company's liquidity are premiums and certain annuity considerations, investment and fee income, investment maturities, sales of investments and internal borrowings. The principal uses of that liquidity include benefits, claims, and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders, withdrawals and net policy loan activity. Other uses of liquidity include commissions, general and administrative expenses, purchases of investments, the payment of dividends and returns of capital to the parent company, hedging and reinsurance activity and payments in connection with financing activities.\nBenefits and expenses increased $0.9 billion from $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update to our assumptions and other refinements, the increase of $1.1 billion primarily was driven by:\nResults of Operations\nHedging activities associated with living benefit guarantees\n\u2022Risk Factors. See Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the risks to our businesses posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022Significant Realized investment gains (losses), reflecting a favorable impact related to the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture and portions of the U.S. GAAP liability before NPR, that are excluded from our hedge target driven by favorable equity market performance and rising interest rates.\nThe hedging portion of our risk management strategy associated with our living benefit guarantees is being managed within the Company. For the portion of the risk management strategy executed through hedging, we enter into a range of exchange-traded, cleared and other OTC equity and interest rate derivatives in order to hedge certain living benefit guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives against changes in certain capital market risks above a designated threshold. The portion of the risk management strategy comprising the hedging portion requires access to liquidity to meet the Company's payment obligations relating to these derivatives, such as payments for periodic settlements, purchases, maturities and terminations. These liquidity needs can vary materially due to, among other items, changes in interest rates, equity markets, mortality and policyholder behavior.\nAs a financial services company, market interest rates are a key driver of the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Changes in interest rates can affect our results of operations and/or our financial condition in several ways, including favorable or adverse impacts to:\nThe Company earns revenues principally from contract charges, mortality and expense fees, asset administration fees from annuity and investment products and from net investment income on the investment of general account and other funds. The Company earns contract fees, mortality and expense fees and asset administration fees primarily from the sale and servicing of annuity products. The Company's operating expenses principally consist of annuity benefit guarantees provided and reserves established for anticipated future annuity benefit guarantees and costs of managing risk related to these products, interest credited to contractholders' account balances, general business expenses, reinsurance premiums, commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products it sold.\nPolicyholders' Account Balances\nLiquidity\nIn addition, an allowance for credit losses is measured each quarter for available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans. For additional information regarding our policies regarding the measurement of credit losses, see Note 2 to the Financial Statements.\nRegulatory Environment. See Business-Regulation\u201d for a discussion of regulatory developments that may impact the Company and the associated risks.\nOverview\nYou should read the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" included below the Table of Contents, Risk Factors\u201d, and the Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2021 to 2020 Annual Comparison\nOur businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by domestic and international regulators. These regulations currently include requirements (many of which are the subject of ongoing rule-making) relating to capital, leverage, liquidity, stress-testing, overall risk management, credit exposure reporting and credit concentration. For information on these regulatory initiatives and their potential impact on us, see Business-Regulation\" and Risk Factors\".\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nWith regard to interest rate assumptions used in evaluating DAC, DSI and liabilities for future policy benefits for certain of our products, we generally update the long-term and near-term future rates used to project fixed income returns annually and quarterly, respectively. As a result of our 2021 annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, we kept our long-term expectation of the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate unchanged and continue to grade to a rate of 3.25% over ten years. As part of our quarterly market experience updates, we update our near-term projections of interest rates to reflect changes in current rates.\nLiquidity is measured against internally-developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support. We consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets (e.g., type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate our liquidity under various stress scenarios, including company-specific and market-wide events. We continue to believe that cash generated by ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios.\nPrudential Financial and Prudential Funding borrow funds in the capital markets primarily through the direct issuance of commercial paper. The borrowings serve as an additional source of financing to meet our working capital needs. Prudential Funding operates under a support agreement with Prudential Insurance whereby Prudential Insurance has agreed to maintain Prudential Funding's positive tangible net worth at all times.\n\u2022$3.7 billion decrease in Deferred policy acquisition costs primarily due to the unwinding of assumed costs as part of the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture and ceding costs as part of the new reinsurance with Pruco Life;\nFor our investments classified as available-for-sale, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\u201d ( AOCI\u201d), a separate component of equity. For our investments classified as trading and equity securities, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within Other income (loss)\u201d. Our commercial mortgage and other loans are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances, net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and expenses and unamortized premiums or discounts and a valuation allowance for losses.\nTotal equity decreased $1.0 billion from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020 to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2021, primarily driven by return of capital of $3.8 billion related to the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture and $1.4 billion due to unrealized losses on investments driven by rising interest rates reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), partially offset by an after-tax net income of $4.1 billion.\nIn 2021, the United States experienced multiple waves of COVID-19, with the severity of each wave depending on such factors as seasonality, varying levels of population immunity, and the evolution of the virus itself into different variants. Deaths from COVID-19 in the United States peaked in the first quarter of 2021, prior to widespread vaccination, and again in the third quarter, due to the emergence of the Delta variant. In December, the Omicron variant emerged in the United States and has since become the dominant strain, causing many more infections but with a smaller percentage of infections resulting in hospitalizations and deaths compared to prior waves. Several vaccines are now widely accessible and other therapeutics, such as antiviral treatments, are increasingly becoming available. As a result, the overall financial impact to the Company is expected to remain manageable; however, the future evolution of the virus, among other factors, could cause the actual course of the pandemic to differ from our current expectations. The Company has taken several measures to manage the impacts of this pandemic. The actual and expected impacts of these measures and other items are set forth below:\n\u2022Measurement of the allowance for credit losses on fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale, commercial mortgage loans, and other loans; and", "item_7_text": "\u2022 investment-related activity, including: investment income returns, net interest margins, net investment spread results,\nAmortization methodologies\nPartially offset by:\nFuture Policy Benefit Reserves\nIndustry Trends\nWe manage PALAC to regulatory capital levels consistent with our AA\u201d ratings targets. We utilize the risk-based capital ( RBC\u201d) ratio as a primary measure of capital adequacy. RBC is calculated based on statutory financial statements and risk formulas consistent with the practices of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\"). RBC considers, among other things, risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with an insurer's products and liabilities, interest rate risks and general business risks. RBC ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring an insurer's solvency and ability to pay future claims. The reporting of RBC measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities, but is available to the public. The Company's capital levels substantially exceed the minimum level required by applicable insurance regulations. Our regulatory capital levels may be affected in the future by changes to the applicable regulations, proposals for which are currently under consideration by both domestic and international insurance regulators.\ni. Product Design Features:\n\n\u2022 hedging costs and other risk mitigation activities;\n\u2022Higher Commission expense primarily driven by the unwinding of assumed deferred acquisition costs, partially offset by ceding allowance received as part of the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture.\nIn September 2021, Prudential Annuities, Inc. ( PAI\u201d) entered into a definitive agreement to sell its equity interest in Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corporation (the Company\u201d or PALAC\u201d) to Fortitude Group Holdings, LLC. The transaction will result in a benefit to Prudential Financial Inc. (\"Prudential Financial\") comprised of the purchase price for PALAC, a pre-closing net capital distribution by PALAC and an expected tax impact. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\n(6)Excludes amounts from the changes in unrealized gains and losses from fixed income instruments recorded in other comprehensive income (versus net income) of $1,659 million and $1,298 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRevenues increased $11.2 billion from a loss of $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 to a gain of $8.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update to our assumptions and other refinements, the increase was $11.3 billion primarily driven by:\nLiquid Assets\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Management, on an ongoing basis, reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements. If management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances, the Company's results of operations and financial position as reported in the Financial Statements could change significantly.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nIncome Tax Expense vs. Income Tax Paid in Cash\n(3)Represents the changes in fair value of the derivatives utilized to hedge potential claims associated with our variable annuity living benefit guarantees.\nThe CARES Act. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) was enacted into law. One provision of the CARES Act amends the Tax Act of 2017 and allows companies with net operating losses ( NOLs\u201d) originating in 2020, 2019 or 2018 to carry back those losses for up to five years. The Company has generated taxable income in 2020. Therefore, there is no impact from the change in law for NOL carry back to tax years that have a 35% tax rate.\nThe Company's liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and interest that relate to tax years still subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. The completion of review or the expiration of the Federal statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the liability for income taxes. The Company had no unrecognized benefit as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. We do not anticipate any significant changes within the next 12 months to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired.\nEffective December 1, 2021, the Company entered into a reinsurance agreement with Pruco Life under which the Company reinsured all of its variable and fixed indexed annuities and fixed annuities with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal income feature to Pruco Life.\n\u2022For certain contract features, such as those related to guaranteed minimum death benefits ( GMDB\u201d) and guaranteed minimum income benefits ( GMIB\u201d), a liability is established when associated assessments (which include policy charges for administration, mortality, expense, surrender, and other, regardless of how characterized) are recognized. This liability is established using current best estimate assumptions and is based on the ratio of the present value of total expected excess payments (e.g., payments in excess of account value) over the life of the contract divided by the present value of total expected assessments (i.e., benefit ratio). The liability equals the current benefit ratio multiplied by cumulative assessments recognized to date, plus interest, less cumulative excess payments to date. The result of the benefit ratio method is that the liability at any point in time represents an accumulation of the portion of assessments received to date expected to be needed to fund future excess payments, less any excess payments already paid. The liability does not necessarily reflect the full policyholder obligation the Company expects to pay at the conclusion of the contract since a portion of that excess payment would be funded by assessments received in the future and would be recognized in the liability at that time. Similar to as described above for DAC, the reserves are subject to adjustments based on annual reviews of assumptions and quarterly adjustments for experience, including market performance. These adjustments reflect the impact on the benefit ratio of using actual historical experience from the issuance date to the balance sheet date plus updated estimates of future experience. The updated benefit ratio is then applied to all prior periods' assessments to derive an adjustment to the reserve recognized through a benefit or charge to current period earnings.\nThe following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.\nThe Company has returned capital to its parent, PAI, for the periods indicated below.\nRevenues, Benefits and Expenses\nChanges in Financial Position\nVariable Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants. The primary risk exposures of our variable annuity contracts relate to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including capital markets assumptions such as equity market returns, interest rates and market volatility, along with actuarial assumptions such as contractholder mortality, the timing and amount of annuitization and withdrawals, and contract lapses. For these risk exposures, achievement of our expected returns is subject to the risk that actual experience will differ from the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products. We manage our exposure to certain risks driven by fluctuations in capital markets primarily through a combination of i) Product Design Features, ii) our Asset Liability Management Strategy, and iii) our Capital Hedge Program as discussed below.\n\u2022CARES Act and Other Regulatory Developments. See \"Business-Regulation\" for additional information.\nIndexed Variable Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants. The primary risk exposure of our indexed variable annuity products relates to the investment risks we bear in order to credit to the customer's account balance the required crediting rate based on the performance of the elected indices at the end of each term. We manage this risk primarily through our investment strategies including derivatives and product design features, which include credit rate resetting subject to contractual minimums as well as surrender charges applied during the early years of the contract that help to provide protection for premature withdrawals. In addition, our indexed variable annuity strategies have an interim value provision that provides protection from lapse in the case of rising interest rates. We also manage these risk exposures through affiliated reinsurance. For information on our affiliated reinsurance agreements, see Business-Reinsurance\u201d section and Note 14 to the Financial Statements.\nCapital\n\u2022policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity.\nAn increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by one percentage point would have resulted in a decrease or increase in our 2021 \"Income tax expense (benefit)\" of $63 million.\nFor equity method investments, the carrying value of these investments is written down or impaired to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary.

Interest rates in the U.S. have experienced a sustained period of historically low levels, which continue to negatively impact our investment-related activity, including our investment income returns, net investment spread results, and portfolio income and reinvestment yields. See Impact of a Low Interest Rate Environment\u201d below. In addition, we are subject to financial impacts associated with movements in equity markets and the evolution of the credit cycle as discussed in Risk Factors\u201d.\n\u2022$7.4 billion increase in Reinsurance recoverables driven by the new reinsurance with Pruco Life; and\nSensitivities for Insurance Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table illustrates the net impact on our results of operations from changes in the U.S. GAAP embedded derivative liability and hedge positions under the Asset Liability Management (\"ALM\") strategy, and the related amortization of DAC and other costs, for the periods indicated:\n\u2022For life contingent payout annuities, we utilize a net premium valuation methodology in measuring the liability for future policy benefits. Under this methodology, a liability for future policy benefits is accrued when premium revenue is recognized. The liability, which represents the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums (portion of the gross premium required to provide for all benefits and expenses), is estimated using methods that include assumptions applicable at the time the insurance contracts are made with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as appropriate. Original assumptions continue to be used in subsequent accounting periods to determine changes in the liability for future policy benefits (often referred to as the lock-in concept\u201d), unless a premium deficiency exists. The result of the net premium valuation methodology is that the liability at any point in time represents an accumulation of the portion of premiums received to date expected to be needed to fund future benefits (i.e., net premiums received to date), less any benefits and expenses already paid. The liability does not necessarily reflect the full policyholder obligation the Company expects to pay at the conclusion of the contract since a portion of that obligation would be funded by net premiums received in the future and would be recognized in the liability at that time. We perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation. If the liabilities determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net reserves (i.e., GAAP reserves net of any DAC, DSI or VOBA asset), the existing net reserves are adjusted by first reducing these assets by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings. If the deficiency is more than these asset balances for insurance contracts, we then increase the net reserves by the excess, again through a charge to current period earnings. If a premium deficiency is recognized, the assumptions as of the premium deficiency test date are locked-in and used in subsequent valuations and the net reserves continue to be subject to premium deficiency testing. In addition, for limited-payment contracts, future policy benefit reserves also include a deferred profit liability representing gross premiums received in excess of net premiums. The deferred profits are generally recognized in revenue in a constant relationship with insurance in force or with the amount of expected future benefit payments.\nFor additional information on income tax related items, see Business-Regulation\u201d and Note 11 to the Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\n\u2022General hedge results. For the derivative portion of the ALM strategy, the net hedging impact (the extent to which the changes in value of the hedging instruments offset the change in value of the portion of the economic liability we are hedging) may be impacted by a number of factors, including: cash flow timing differences between our hedging instruments and the corresponding portion of the economic liability we are hedging, basis differences attributable to actual underlying contractholder funds to be hedged versus hedgeable indices, rebalancing costs related to dynamic rebalancing of hedging instruments as markets move, certain elements of the economic liability that may not be hedged (including certain actuarial assumptions), and implied and realized market volatility on the hedge positions relative to the portion of the economic liability we seek to hedge.\n\u2022Different valuation methodologies in measuring the liability we intend to cover with fixed income instruments and derivatives versus the liability reported under U.S. GAAP. The valuation methodology utilized in estimating the economic liability we intend to defray with fixed income instruments and derivatives is different from that required to be utilized to measure the liability under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the valuation of the economic liability excludes certain items that are included within the U.S. GAAP liability, such as NPR in order to maximize protection irrespective of the possibility of our own default and risk margins (required by U.S. GAAP but different from our best estimate).\n\u2022Results of Operations. See Results of Operations\u201d for a discussion of results for the full year of 2021.\n2021 to 2020 Annual Comparison\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nEffective and prudent liquidity and capital management is a priority across the organization. Management monitors the liquidity of the Company on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi-year time horizon. We use a Risk Appetite Framework ( RAF\u201d) to ensure that all risks taken by the Company align with our capacity and willingness to take those risks. The RAF provides a dynamic assessment of capital and liquidity stress impacts, including scenarios similar to, and more severe than, those occurring due to COVID-19, and is intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available to absorb those impacts. We believe that our capital and liquidity resources are sufficient to satisfy the capital and liquidity requirements of the Company.\nThe following table summarizes the impact that could result on each of the listed financial statement balances from changes in certain key assumptions. The information below is for illustrative purposes and includes only the hypothetical direct impact on December 31, 2021 balances of changes in a single assumption and not changes in any combination of assumptions. Additionally, the illustration of the insurance assumption impacts below reflects a parallel shift in the insurance assumptions; however, these may be non-parallel in practice. Changes in current assumptions could result in impacts to financial statement balances that are in excess of the amounts illustrated. A description of the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of each of these financial statement balances is provided above. For traditional long-duration and limited-payment contracts, U.S. GAAP requires the original assumptions used when the contracts are issued to be locked-in and that those assumptions be used in all future liability calculations as long as the resulting liabilities are adequate to provide for the future benefits and expenses (i.e., there is no premium deficiency). Therefore, these products are not reflected in the sensitivity table below unless the hypothetical change in assumption would result in an adverse impact that would cause a premium deficiency. Similarly, the impact of any favorable change in assumptions for traditional long-duration and limited-payment contracts is not reflected in the table below given that the current assumption is required to remain locked-in and instead the positive impacts would be recognized into net income over the life of the policies in force.\nThe following paragraphs provide additional details about the reserves we have established:\nnew money rates, mortgage loan prepayments and bond redemptions;\n\u2022$7.0 billion increase in Reinsurance payables driven by the new reinsurance with Pruco Life; and\nOur business is impacted by financial markets, economic conditions, regulatory oversight, and a variety of trends that affect the industries where we compete.\nThe hedging portion of the risk management strategy may also result in derivative-related collateral postings to (when we are in a net pay position) or from (when we are in a net receive position) counterparties. The net collateral position depends on changes in interest rates and equity markets related to the amount of the exposures hedged. Depending on market conditions, the collateral posting requirements can result in material liquidity needs when we are in a net pay position.\nWe capitalize costs that are directly related to the acquisition of annuity contracts. These costs primarily include commissions, as well as costs of policy issuance and underwriting and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully negotiated contracts. We have also deferred costs associated with sales inducements offered in the past related to our variable and fixed annuity contracts. Sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the policyholders' account balances mainly as an inducement to purchase the contract. For additional information about sales inducements, see Note 9 to the Financial Statements. We generally amortize DAC and DSI over the expected lives of the contracts, based on our estimates of the level and timing of gross profits. As described in more detail below, in calculating DAC and DSI amortization we are required to make assumptions about investment returns, mortality, persistency, and other items that impact our estimates of the level and timing of gross profits. We also periodically evaluate the recoverability of our DAC and DSI. For certain contracts, this evaluation is performed as part of our premium deficiency testing, as discussed further below in Insurance Liabilities-Future Policy Benefits\". As of December 31, 2021, DAC and DSI were $567 million and $295 million, respectively.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nInsurance Liabilities\nPolicyholders' account balances liability represents the contract value that has accrued to the benefit of the policyholder as of the balance sheet date. This liability is primarily associated with the accumulated account deposits, plus interest credited, less policyholder withdrawals and other charges assessed against the account balance, as applicable. The liability also includes provisions for benefits under non-life contingent payout annuities. Policyholders' account balances also include amounts representing the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with the index-linked features of certain annuity products. For additional information regarding the valuation of these embedded derivatives, see Note 5 to the Financial Statements.\nThe differences between income taxes expected at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% applicable for 2021, 2020 and 2019, and the reported income tax expense (benefit) are provided in the following table:\n\u2022product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix; and\n\u2022$1.9 billion increase in Other assets driven by the new reinsurance with Pruco Life.\nEffective Tax Rate\nTotal assets decreased $5.7 billion from $64.3 billion at December 31, 2020 to $58.6 billion at December 31, 2021. Significant components were:\nThe valuation of the economic liability we seek to defray excludes certain items that are included within the U.S. GAAP liability, such as NPR in order to maximize protection irrespective of the possibility of our own default, as well as risk margins (required by U.S. GAAP but different from our best estimate) and valuation methodology differences. The following table provides a reconciliation between the liability reported under U.S. GAAP and the economic liability we manage through our ALM strategy as of the periods indicated:\nThe quarterly adjustments for current period experience referred to above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for a given period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for that period. To the extent each period's actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period, the assumed level of total gross profits may change. In these cases, we recognize a cumulative adjustment to all previous periods' amortization, also referred to as an experience true-up adjustment.\nTaxes on Income\nSale of PALAC\nOur liquidity is managed to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations. Liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, as described more fully below, including portfolios of liquid assets. Our investment portfolios are integral to the overall liquidity of the Company. We use a projection process for cash flows from operations to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet projected cash outflows, including claims. The impact of Prudential Funding, LLC's (\"Prudential Funding\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, financing capacity on liquidity (as described below) is considered in the internal liquidity measures of the Company.\nThe Company has sold a wide array of annuities, including deferred and immediate variable annuities with (1) fixed interest rate allocation options, subject to a market value adjustment, that are registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d), and (2) fixed-rate allocation options subject to a limited market value adjustment or no market value adjustment and not registered with the SEC. The Company ceased offering these products in March 2010. In 2018, the Company resumed offering annuity products to new investors (except in New York). For more information on products, see \"Item 1 Business-Products\".\nOur effective tax rate is based on income, non-taxable and non-deductible items, tax credits, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. The Dividend Received Deduction ( DRD\u201d) is a major reason for the difference between the Company's effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate. The DRD is an estimate that incorporates the prior and current year information, as well as the current year's equity market performance. Both the current estimate of the DRD and the DRD in future periods can vary based on factors such as, but not limited to, changes in the amount of dividends received that are eligible for the DRD, changes in the amount of distributions received from underlying fund investments, changes in the account balances of variable life and annuity contracts, and the Company's taxable income before the DRD.\nWe also regularly evaluate and adjust the related DAC and DSI balances with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the impact of actual gross profits and changes in our projections of estimated future gross profits on our DAC and DSI amortization rates. Adjustments to the DAC and DSI balances include the impact to our estimate of total gross profits of the annual review of assumptions, our quarterly adjustments for current period experience, and our quarterly adjustments for market performance. Each of these adjustments is further discussed below in -Annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments\u201d.\nThe regulatory capital level of the Company can be materially impacted by interest rate and equity market fluctuations, changes in the values of derivatives, the level of impairments recorded, and credit quality migration of the investment portfolio, among other items. In addition, the reinsurance of business or the recapture of business subject to reinsurance arrangements due to defaults by, or credit quality migration affecting, the reinsurers or for other reasons could negatively impact regulatory capital levels. The Company's regulatory capital level is also affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator.\nOur investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities, other invested assets and derivative financial instruments. Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or the values of securities. Derivative financial instruments we generally use include swaps, futures, forwards and options and may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) market. We are also party to financial instruments that contain derivative instruments that are embedded\u201d in the financial instruments. Management believes the following accounting policies related to investments, including derivatives, are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. Each of these policies is discussed further within other relevant disclosures related to investments and derivatives, as referenced below:\nIncome (loss) from operations before income taxes increased $10.3 billion from a loss of $4.0 billion in 2020 to a gain of $6.3 billion in 2021. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, income from operations increased $10.4 billion primarily driven by:\n\u2022 customer account values, including their impact on fee income;\n\n2021 to 2020 Annual Comparison\nLiquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, U.S. Treasury fixed maturities, fixed maturities that are not designated as held-to-maturity, and public equity securities. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had liquid assets of $12 billion and $21 billion, respectively. The portion of liquid assets comprised cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was $3 billion and $1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, $8 billion, or 92%, of the fixed maturity investments in the Company's general account portfolios were rated high or highest quality based on NAIC or equivalent rating.\nWe believe we can sustain long-term remote work and social distancing while ensuring that critical business operations are sustained. In addition, we are managing COVID-19-related impacts on third-party provided services, and do not anticipate significant interruption in critical operations.\nA portion of the variable annuity contracts that we offer include an asset transfer feature. This feature is implemented at the contract level, and transfers assets between certain variable investment sub-accounts selected by the annuity contractholder and, depending on the benefit feature, a fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond fund sub-account within the separate account. The objective of the asset transfer feature is to reduce our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility. The transfers are based on a static mathematical formula used with the particular benefit which considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the impact of investment performance on the contractholder's total account value. Other product design features we utilize include, among others, asset allocation restrictions, minimum issuance age requirements and certain limitations on the amount of contractholder purchase payments, as well as a required minimum allocation to our general account for certain of our products. We continue to introduce products that diversify our risk profile and have incorporated provisions in product design allowing frequent revisions of key pricing elements for certain of our products. In addition, there is diversity in our fee arrangements, as certain fees are primarily based on the benefit guarantee amount, the contractholder account value and/or premiums, which helps preserve certain revenue streams when market fluctuations cause account values to decline.\nFor 2021, the gain of $7.0 billion primarily reflected favorable impacts related to the portions of the U.S. GAAP liability before NPR that are excluded from the hedge target driven by rising interest rates and favorable equity markets and the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture impact, partially offset by changes in fair value of hedge assets and capital hedges driven by rising interest rates and favorable equity markets and unfavorable NPR adjustment.\nA contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events. Under U.S. GAAP, accruals for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated, such as in connection with an unresolved legal matter. The initial reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and, ultimately, when the matter is brought to closure.\n\nPartially offset by:\nRisks and Risk Mitigants\nii. Asset Liability Management Strategy (including fixed income instruments and derivatives):\n\u2022Different accounting treatment between liabilities and assets supporting those liabilities. Under U.S. GAAP, changes in fair value of the embedded derivative liability, derivative income and fixed income instruments designated as trading are immediately reflected in net income, while changes in the fair value of fixed income instruments that are designated as available-for-sale are recorded as unrealized gains (losses) in other comprehensive income.\nThe weighted average rate of return assumptions used in developing estimated market returns consider many factors specific to each product type, including asset durations, asset allocations and other factors. With regard to equity market assumptions, the near-term future rate of return assumption used in evaluating DAC, DSI and VOBA and liabilities for future policy benefits for certain of our products, primarily our domestic variable annuity products, is generally updated each quarter and is derived using a reversion to the mean approach, a common industry practice. Under this approach, we consider historical equity returns and adjust projected equity returns over an initial future period of five years (the near-term\u201d) so that equity returns converge to the long-term expected rate of return. If the near-term projected future rate of return is greater than our near-term maximum future rate of return of 15.0%, we use our maximum future rate of return. If the near-term projected future rate of return is lower than our near-term minimum future rate of return of 0%, we use our minimum future rate of return. As of December 31, 2021, we assume an 8.0% long-term equity expected rate of return and a 0.0% near-term mean reversion equity expected rate of return.\niii. Capital Hedge Program:\nIn addition to DAC and DSI, we also recognize an asset for value of business acquired, or VOBA, which is an intangible asset that represents an adjustment to the stated value of acquired in-force insurance contract liabilities to present them at fair value, determined as of the acquisition date. VOBA is amortized over the expected life of the acquired contracts using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC and DSI (see -Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Deferred Sales Inducements\u201d above for additional information). VOBA is also subject to recoverability testing. As of December 31, 2021, VOBA was $28 million.\nIn managing liquidity, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. We use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent, timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers.\n\u2022Recognition of other-than-temporary impairments (\"OTTI\") for equity method investments.\nValue of Business Acquired\nIncome tax expense recorded under U.S. GAAP routinely differs from the income taxes paid in cash in any given year. Income tax expense recorded under U.S. GAAP is based on income reported in our Statements of Operations for the current period and it includes both current and deferred taxes. Income taxes paid during the year include tax installments made for the current year as well as tax payments and refunds related to prior periods.\nThe reserves for future policy benefits of our business relate to reserves for the GMDB and GMIB features of our variable annuities, and for the optional living benefit features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives. As discussed above, in establishing reserves for GMDBs and GMIBs, we utilize current best estimate assumptions. The primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves generally include annuitization, lapse, withdrawal and mortality assumptions, as well as interest rate and equity market return assumptions. Lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on the in-the-moneyness of the benefit and reflect other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. Lapse rates are reduced when contracts are more in-the-money. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower for the period where surrender charges apply. For life contingent payout annuity contracts, we establish reserves using best estimate assumptions with provisions for adverse deviations as of inception or best estimate assumptions as of the most recent loss recognition date.\n\u2022fair value of, and possible impairments, on intangible assets;\nEffective July 1, 2021, Pruco Life recaptured the risks related to its business that had previously been reinsured to the Company from April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2021. The recapture does not impact PLNJ, which will continue to reinsure its new and in force business to Prudential Insurance. The product risks related to the previously reinsured business that were being managed in the Company, were transferred to Pruco Life. In addition, the living benefit hedging program related to the previously reinsured living benefit riders are being managed within Pruco Life. For more information on this transaction, see Note 1 to the Financial Statements.\nFuture Policy Benefits\nCOVID-19\nThe assumptions used in establishing reserves are generally based on the Company's experience, industry experience and/or other factors, as applicable. We update our actuarial assumptions, such as mortality and policyholder behavior assumptions annually, unless a material change is observed in an interim period that we feel is indicative of a long-term trend. Generally, we do not expect trends to change significantly in the short-term and, to the extent these trends may change, we expect such changes to be gradual over the long-term. In a sustained low interest rate environment, there is an increased likelihood that the reserves determined based on best estimate assumptions may be greater than the net liabilities.\nIncome (loss) from Operations before Income Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fair value of our fixed income instruments and derivative assets exceed our economic liability.\nPrudential Funding, LLC\nThe impacts presented within this table exclude the related impacts of our asset liability management strategy, which seeks to offset the changes in the balances presented within this table and is primarily composed of investments and derivatives. See further below for a discussion of the estimates and assumptions involved with the application of U.S. GAAP accounting policies for these instruments and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d for hypothetical impacts on related balances as a result of changes in certain significant assumptions.\nTotal liabilities decreased by $4.6 billion from $61.5 billion at December 31, 2020 to $56.9 billion at December 31, 2021. Significant components were:\nWe present at fair value in the statements of financial position our debt security investments classified as available-for-sale, investments classified as trading, and certain fixed maturities, equity securities, and certain investments within Other invested assets,\u201d such as derivatives. For additional information regarding the key estimates and assumptions surrounding the determination of fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities, as well as derivative instruments, embedded derivatives and other investments, see Note 5 to the Financial Statements.\n(4)Represents the changes in fair value of equity derivatives of the capital hedge program intended to protect a portion of the overall capital position of our business against exposure to the equity markets.\nAccounting Policies & Pronouncements\nEffective July 1, 2021, Pruco Life Insurance Company ( Pruco Life\u201d) recaptured the risks related to its business, as discussed above, that had previously been reinsured to the Company from April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2021. The recapture does not impact Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey ( PLNJ\u201d), which will continue to reinsure its new and in force business to The Prudential Insurance Company of America ( Prudential Insurance\u201d). The product risks related to the previously reinsured business that were being managed in the Company, were transferred to Pruco Life. In addition, the living benefit hedging program related to the previously reinsured living benefit riders are being managed within Pruco Life. This transaction is referred to as the \"2021 Variable Annuities Recapture\".\nWe establish reserves for future policy benefits to, or on behalf of, policyholders, using methodologies prescribed by U.S. GAAP. The reserving methodologies used include the following:\n\u2022$10.4 billion decrease in Total investments and Cash and cash equivalents primarily driven by consideration paid related to the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture and new reinsurance with Pruco Life and dividend distributions;\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022 insurance reserve levels, market experience true-ups and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (\"DAC\")/value of business acquired ( VOBA\u201d)/deferred sales inducements (\"DSI\");\nFor 2020, the loss of $2.6 billion primarily reflected unfavorable impacts related to the portions of the U.S. GAAP liability before NPR that are excluded from the hedge target, partially offset by changes in fair value of hedge assets driven by declining interest rates.\nFixed Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants. The primary risk exposure of our fixed annuity products relates to investment risks we bear for providing customers a minimum guaranteed interest rate or an index-linked interest rate required to be credited to the customer's account value, which include interest rate fluctuations and/or sustained periods of low interest rates, and credit risk related to the underlying investments. We manage these risk exposures primarily through our investment strategies and product design features, which include credit rate resetting subject to the minimum guaranteed interest rate, as well as surrender charges applied during the early years of the contract that help to provide protection for premature withdrawals. In addition, a portion of our fixed annuity products has a market value adjustment provision that affords protection of lapse in the case of rising interest rates. We also manage these risk exposures through affiliated reinsurance. For information on our affiliated reinsurance agreements, see Business-Reinsurance\u201d section and Note 14 to the Financial Statements.\n\u2022For certain product guarantees, primarily certain optional living benefit features of the variable annuity products including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ( GMAB\u201d), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ( GMWB\u201d) and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits ( GMIWB\u201d), the benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives using a fair value accounting framework. The fair value of these contracts is calculated as the present value of expected future benefit payments to contractholders less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. Under U.S. GAAP, the fair values of these benefit features are based on assumptions a market participant would use in valuing these embedded derivatives. Changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives are recorded quarterly through a benefit or charge to current period earnings. For additional information regarding the valuation of these embedded derivatives, see Note 5 to the Financial Statements.\nSince the first quarter of 2020, the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) has caused extreme stress and disruption in the global economy and financial markets, and elevated mortality and morbidity for the global population. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our results of operations in the current period and is expected to impact our results of operations in future periods.\nASU 2018-12 will impact, at least to some extent, the accounting and disclosure requirements for all long-duration insurance and investment contracts issued by the Company. The Company expects the standard to have a significant financial impact on the Financial Statements and will significantly enhance disclosures. In addition to the significant impacts to the balance sheet upon adoption, the Company also expects an impact to the pattern of earnings emergence following the transition date. See Note 2 to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of ASU 2018-12, as well as other accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted and newly adopted accounting pronouncements.\nWe employ a capital hedge program within the Company to protect a portion of the overall capital position of the variable annuities business against its exposure to the equity markets. The capital hedge program is conducted using equity derivatives which include equity call and put options, total return swaps and futures contracts.\nFinancing Activities\n\u2022Significant Realized investment gains (losses), reflecting a favorable impact to the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture and portions of the U.S. GAAP liability before NPR, that are excluded from our hedge target driven by favorable equity market performance and rising interest rates.\nOverview\n\u2022Valuation of investments, including derivatives;\nRevenues and Expenses\n\n\u2022$2.6 billion increase in Policyholders' account balances primarily driven by incremental general account product sales.\nLiquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the Company. Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operations of our business, fund business growth, and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our business, general economic conditions, our ability to borrow from affiliates and our access to the capital markets through affiliates as described herein.\n(2)Represents the change in the liability (excluding NPR) for our variable annuities which is measured utilizing a valuation methodology that is required under U.S. GAAP. This liability includes such items as risk margins which are required by U.S. GAAP but not included in our best estimate of the liability.\nUnder our ALM strategy, we expect differences in the U.S. GAAP net income impact between the changes in value of the fixed income instruments (either designated as available-for-sale or designated as trading) and derivatives as compared to the changes in the embedded derivative liability these assets support. These differences can be primarily attributed to three distinct areas:\nThe quarterly adjustments for market performance referred to above reflect the impact of changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance and market conditions. A significant portion of gross profits for our variable annuity contracts is dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options. This rate of return influences the fees we earn on variable annuity contracts, costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts, as well as other sources of profit. Returns that are higher than our expectations for a given period produce higher than expected account balances, which increase the future fees we expect to earn on variable annuity contracts and decrease the future costs we expect to incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts. The opposite occurs when returns are lower than our expectations. The changes in future expected gross profits are used to recognize a cumulative adjustment to all prior periods' amortization.\n\u2022Business Continuity. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been executing Prudential Financial's and our business continuity protocols to ensure our employees are safe and able to serve our customers. This included effectively transitioning the vast majority of our employees to remote work arrangements in 2020 and 2021.\nWe generally amortize DAC and other costs over the expected life of the policies in proportion to total gross profits. Total gross profits include both actual gross profits and estimates of gross profits for future periods. Gross profits are defined as (i) amounts assessed for mortality, contract administration, surrender charges, and other assessments plus amounts earned from investment of policyholder balances, less (ii) benefits in excess of policyholder balances, costs incurred for contract administration, the net cost of reinsurance for certain products, interest credited to policyholder balances and other credits. If significant negative gross profits are expected in any periods, the amount of insurance in force is generally substituted as the base for computing amortization. U.S. GAAP gross profits and amortization rates also include the impacts of the embedded derivatives associated with certain of the optional living benefit features of our variable annuity contracts and indexed annuity contracts and related hedging activities. In calculating amortization expense, we estimate the amounts of gross profits that will be included in our U.S. GAAP results, and utilize these estimates to calculate distinct amortization rates and expense amounts. In addition, in calculating gross profits, we include the profits and losses related to contracts previously issued by the Company that are reported in affiliated legal entities other than the Company as a result of, for example, reinsurance agreements with those affiliated entities. The Company is an indirect subsidiary of Prudential Financial (an SEC registrant) and has extensive transactions and relationships with other subsidiaries of Prudential Financial, including reinsurance agreements, as discussed in Note 10 and Note 14 to the Financial Statements. Incorporating all product-related profits and losses in gross profits, including those that are reported in affiliated legal entities, produces an amortization pattern representative of the total economics of the products. For a further discussion of the amortization of DAC and other costs, see -Results of Operations\u201d.\nImpact of a Low Interest Rate Environment\nThe Company was established in 1969 and has been a provider of annuity contracts for the individual market in the United States. The Company's products have been sold primarily to individuals to provide for long-term savings and retirement needs and to address the economic impact of premature death, estate planning concerns and supplemental retirement income.\nInsurance Assets\nWe employ an ALM strategy that utilizes a combination of both traditional fixed income instruments and derivatives to help defray potential claims associated with our variable annuity living benefit guarantees. The economic liability we manage with this ALM strategy consists of expected living benefit claims under less severe market conditions, which are managed using fixed income and derivative instruments, and potential living benefit claims resulting from more severe market conditions, which are hedged using derivative instruments. For the portion of our ALM strategy executed with derivatives, we enter into a range of exchange-traded and over-the-counter (\"OTC\") equity, interest rate and credit derivatives, including, but not limited to: equity and treasury futures; total return, credit default and interest rate swaps; and options, including equity options, swaptions, and floors and caps. The intent of this strategy is to more efficiently manage the capital and liquidity associated with these products while continuing to mitigate fluctuations in net income due to movements in capital markets.\nContingencies\nValuation of Investments, Including Derivatives, Measurement of Allowance for Credit Loss, and the Recognition of Other-than-Temporary Impairments\nDemographics. Customer demographics continue to evolve and new opportunities present themselves in different consumer segments such as the millennial and multicultural markets. Consumer expectations and preferences are changing. We believe existing customers and potential customers are increasingly looking for cost-effective solutions that they can easily understand and access through technology-enabled devices. At the same time, income protection, wealth accumulation and the needs of retiring baby boomers are continuing to shape the insurance industry. A persistent retirement security gap exists in terms of both savings and protection. Despite the ongoing phenomenon of the risk and responsibility of retirement savings shifting from employers to employees, employers are becoming increasingly focused on the financial wellness of the individuals they employ.\nCompetitive Environment. See Business\u201d for a discussion of the competitive environment and the basis on which we compete.\nWe perform an annual comprehensive review of the assumptions used in estimating gross profits for future periods. Over the last several years, the Company's most significant assumption updates that have resulted in a change to expected future gross profits and the amortization of DAC, DSI and VOBA have been related to lapse and other contractholder behavior assumptions, mortality, and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments. These assumptions may also cause potential significant variability in amortization expense in the future. The impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.\nASU 2018-12, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) on August 15, 2018 and was amended by ASU 2019-09, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Effective Date, issued in October 2019 and ASU 2020-11, Financial Services-Insurance (Topic 944): Effective Date and Early Application, issued in November 2020. Large calendar-year public companies that early adopt ASU 2018-12 are allowed to apply the guidance either as of January 1, 2020 or January 1, 2021 (and record transition adjustments as of January 1, 2020 or January 1, 2021, respectively) in the 2022 financial statements. Companies that do not early adopt ASU 2018-12 would apply the guidance as of January 1, 2021 (and record transition adjustments as of January 1, 2021) in the 2023 financial statements. The Company will adopt ASU 2018-12 using the modified retrospective transition method where permitted.\nThe effective tax rate is the ratio of Income tax expense (benefit)\u201d divided by Income before income taxes\u201d. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was 20.7%, 21.5% and 22.7%, respectively. For a detailed description of the nature of each significant reconciling item, see Note 11 to the Financial Statements. The change in the effective tax rate from 21.5% in 2020 to 20.7% in 2021 was primarily driven by the increase in pre-tax income. The change in the effective tax rate from 22.7% in 2019 to 21.5% in 2020 was primarily driven by the decrease in pre-tax income.\nFor more information on interest rate risks, see \"Risk Factors-Market Risk\".\n\n(1)Positive amount represents income; negative amount represents a loss.\nThe reserves for certain optional living benefit features, including GMAB, GMWB and GMIWB are accounted for as embedded derivatives at fair value, as described above. This methodology could result in either a liability or contra-liability balance, given changing capital market conditions and various actuarial assumptions. Since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations, the valuations are calculated using internally-developed models with option pricing techniques. The models are based on a risk neutral valuation framework and incorporate premiums for risks inherent in valuation techniques, inputs, and the general uncertainty around the timing and amount of future cash flows. The significant inputs to the valuation models for these embedded derivatives include capital market assumptions, such as interest rate levels and volatility assumptions, the Company's market-perceived risk of its own non-performance risk ( NPR\u201d), as well as actuarially determined assumptions, including mortality rates and contractholder behavior, such as lapse rates, benefit utilization rates and withdrawal rates. Capital market inputs and actual contractholders' account values are updated each quarter based on capital market conditions as of the end of the quarter, including interest rates, equity markets and volatility. In the risk neutral valuation, the initial swap curve drives the total returns used to grow the contractholders' account values. The Company's discount rate assumption is based on the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) swap curve adjusted for an additional spread, which includes an estimate of NPR. Actuarial assumptions, including contractholder behavior and mortality, are reviewed at least annually and updated based upon emerging experience, future expectations and other data, including any observable market data, such as available industry studies or market transactions such as acquisitions and reinsurance transactions. For additional information regarding the valuation of these optional living benefit features, see Note 5 to the Financial Statements.\nThe principal sources of the Company's liquidity are premiums and certain annuity considerations, investment and fee income, investment maturities, sales of investments and internal borrowings. The principal uses of that liquidity include benefits, claims, and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders, withdrawals and net policy loan activity. Other uses of liquidity include commissions, general and administrative expenses, purchases of investments, the payment of dividends and returns of capital to the parent company, hedging and reinsurance activity and payments in connection with financing activities.\nBenefits and expenses increased $0.9 billion from $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update to our assumptions and other refinements, the increase of $1.1 billion primarily was driven by:\nResults of Operations\nHedging activities associated with living benefit guarantees\n\u2022Risk Factors. See Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the risks to our businesses posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022Significant Realized investment gains (losses), reflecting a favorable impact related to the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture and portions of the U.S. GAAP liability before NPR, that are excluded from our hedge target driven by favorable equity market performance and rising interest rates.\nThe hedging portion of our risk management strategy associated with our living benefit guarantees is being managed within the Company. For the portion of the risk management strategy executed through hedging, we enter into a range of exchange-traded, cleared and other OTC equity and interest rate derivatives in order to hedge certain living benefit guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives against changes in certain capital market risks above a designated threshold. The portion of the risk management strategy comprising the hedging portion requires access to liquidity to meet the Company's payment obligations relating to these derivatives, such as payments for periodic settlements, purchases, maturities and terminations. These liquidity needs can vary materially due to, among other items, changes in interest rates, equity markets, mortality and policyholder behavior.\nAs a financial services company, market interest rates are a key driver of the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Changes in interest rates can affect our results of operations and/or our financial condition in several ways, including favorable or adverse impacts to:\nThe Company earns revenues principally from contract charges, mortality and expense fees, asset administration fees from annuity and investment products and from net investment income on the investment of general account and other funds. The Company earns contract fees, mortality and expense fees and asset administration fees primarily from the sale and servicing of annuity products. The Company's operating expenses principally consist of annuity benefit guarantees provided and reserves established for anticipated future annuity benefit guarantees and costs of managing risk related to these products, interest credited to contractholders' account balances, general business expenses, reinsurance premiums, commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products it sold.\nPolicyholders' Account Balances\nLiquidity\nIn addition, an allowance for credit losses is measured each quarter for available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans. For additional information regarding our policies regarding the measurement of credit losses, see Note 2 to the Financial Statements.\nRegulatory Environment. See Business-Regulation\u201d for a discussion of regulatory developments that may impact the Company and the associated risks.\nOverview\nYou should read the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" included below the Table of Contents, Risk Factors\u201d, and the Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2021 to 2020 Annual Comparison\nOur businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by domestic and international regulators. These regulations currently include requirements (many of which are the subject of ongoing rule-making) relating to capital, leverage, liquidity, stress-testing, overall risk management, credit exposure reporting and credit concentration. For information on these regulatory initiatives and their potential impact on us, see Business-Regulation\" and Risk Factors\".\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nWith regard to interest rate assumptions used in evaluating DAC, DSI and liabilities for future policy benefits for certain of our products, we generally update the long-term and near-term future rates used to project fixed income returns annually and quarterly, respectively. As a result of our 2021 annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, we kept our long-term expectation of the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate unchanged and continue to grade to a rate of 3.25% over ten years. As part of our quarterly market experience updates, we update our near-term projections of interest rates to reflect changes in current rates.\nLiquidity is measured against internally-developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support. We consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets (e.g., type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate our liquidity under various stress scenarios, including company-specific and market-wide events. We continue to believe that cash generated by ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios.\nPrudential Financial and Prudential Funding borrow funds in the capital markets primarily through the direct issuance of commercial paper. The borrowings serve as an additional source of financing to meet our working capital needs. Prudential Funding operates under a support agreement with Prudential Insurance whereby Prudential Insurance has agreed to maintain Prudential Funding's positive tangible net worth at all times.\n\u2022$3.7 billion decrease in Deferred policy acquisition costs primarily due to the unwinding of assumed costs as part of the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture and ceding costs as part of the new reinsurance with Pruco Life;\nFor our investments classified as available-for-sale, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\u201d ( AOCI\u201d), a separate component of equity. For our investments classified as trading and equity securities, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within Other income (loss)\u201d. Our commercial mortgage and other loans are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances, net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and expenses and unamortized premiums or discounts and a valuation allowance for losses.\nTotal equity decreased $1.0 billion from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020 to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2021, primarily driven by return of capital of $3.8 billion related to the 2021 Variable Annuities Recapture and $1.4 billion due to unrealized losses on investments driven by rising interest rates reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), partially offset by an after-tax net income of $4.1 billion.\nIn 2021, the United States experienced multiple waves of COVID-19, with the severity of each wave depending on such factors as seasonality, varying levels of population immunity, and the evolution of the virus itself into different variants. Deaths from COVID-19 in the United States peaked in the first quarter of 2021, prior to widespread vaccination, and again in the third quarter, due to the emergence of the Delta variant. In December, the Omicron variant emerged in the United States and has since become the dominant strain, causing many more infections but with a smaller percentage of infections resulting in hospitalizations and deaths compared to prior waves. Several vaccines are now widely accessible and other therapeutics, such as antiviral treatments, are increasingly becoming available. As a result, the overall financial impact to the Company is expected to remain manageable; however, the future evolution of the virus, among other factors, could cause the actual course of the pandemic to differ from our current expectations. The Company has taken several measures to manage the impacts of this pandemic. The actual and expected impacts of these measures and other items are set forth below:\n\u2022Measurement of the allowance for credit losses on fixed maturity securities classified as
