( Cantel\u201d). The MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Our MD&A includes the following sections:\nOverview provides a brief description of our business and a summary of significant activity that has affected or may affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nResults of Operations provides a discussion of the consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources provides an overview of our working capital, cash flows, contractual obligations, financing and foreign currency activities.\nCritical Accounting Policies provides a discussion of our accounting policies that require critical judgments, assumptions and estimates.\nOverview\nCantel is a leading provider of infection prevention products and services in the healthcare market, specializing in the following operating segments:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEndoscopy: Medical device reprocessing systems, disinfectants, detergents and other supplies used to high-level disinfect rigid endoscopes, flexible endoscopes and other instrumentation and disposable infection control products intended to reduce the challenges associated with proper cleaning and high-level disinfection of numerous reusable components used in gastrointestinal ( GI\u201d) endoscopy procedures, pulmonary endoscopy and other procedures that require the reprocessing of medical equipment. In September 2015, this segment commenced the sale of endoscope transport and storage systems, and a number of endoscopy consumable accessories. Additionally, this segment includes technical maintenance service on its products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWater Purification and Filtration: Water purification equipment and services, filtration and separation products, and disinfectant, sterilization and decontamination products and services for the medical, pharmaceutical, biotech, beverage and commercial industrial markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nHealthcare Disposables: Single-use, infection prevention and control healthcare products including face masks, sterilization pouches, towels and bibs, tray covers, saliva ejectors, plastic cups, germicidal wipes and disinfectants, as well as a product for maintaining safe dental unit waterlines. This segment also manufactures and sells biological and chemical indicators for sterility assurance monitoring services in the acute-care, alternate-care, dental and industrial (medical device, life science and other manufacturers) markets.

Since the operating results of the Specialty Packaging segment were not significant in relation to our overall consolidated operating results, the divestiture of the business did not have a major effect on our operations and financial results, and accordingly, has not been classified as a discontinued operation for any of the periods presented.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMost of our equipment, consumables and supplies are used to help prevent the occurrence or spread of infections.\nSignificant Activity\nTable 38: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(i)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSome of our key financial results for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 were as follows:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 39: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet sales increased by 17.7% to $664,755,000 from $565,004,000; organic sales (i.e. excluding acquisitions, a divestiture and foreign currency translation) increased by 12.7%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 40: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 46.5% from 44.9%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet income under United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) increased by 25.0% to $59,953,000 from $47,953,000.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter adjusting net income for amortization expense and atypical items, non-GAAP net income increased by 21.5% to $72,938,000 from $60,039,000, as further described and reconciled to net income in Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in this MD&A.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 43: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDiluted Earnings Per Share ( EPS\u201d) increased by 25.2% to $1.44 from $1.15.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS increased by 21.5% to $1.75 from $1.44, as further described and reconciled to diluted EPS in Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in this MD&A.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense ( Adjusted EBITDAS\u201d) increased by 21.2% to $137,949,000 from $113,811,000, as further described and reconciled to net income in Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in this MD&A.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe continue to benefit from having a broad portfolio of infection prevention products and services sold into diverse business segments, where approximately 73% of our net sales are attributable to consumable products and service.

Sales in our Dialysis segment have been adversely impacted in recent years by the decrease in demand for our products that are used by dialysis centers that reuse dialyzers, such as our sterilant products and RENATRON\u00ae reprocessing equipment. With the exception of the current year that had increased sales of low margin concentrate products, which are products not used in dialyzer reprocessing, this reduction in dialysis sales has reduced overall profitability in this segment relative to prior years. Our market for Dialysis reprocessing products is limited to dialysis centers that reuse dialyzers, which market has been decreasing in the United States despite the environmental advantages and our belief that the per-procedure cost of reuse dialyzers is more economical than single-use dialyzers. Based on discussions with customers, we expect the downward trend in reuse dialyzers in the United States will continue during fiscal 2017 and thereafter. A substantial reduction of our dialysis reuse business will likely have a significant adverse effect on our Dialysis segment and reduce our margins and net income in that segment as well as result in potential future impairments of long-lived assets. Such reduction would also adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.

The 17.7% increase in net sales for fiscal 2016 includes (i) an increase of 12.7% in organic sales, (ii) an increase of 5.5% in sales due to acquisitions, partially offset by the divestiture of our specialty packaging business, and (iii) a decrease of 0.5% in net sales due to foreign currency translation.\nInternational net sales increased by $32,544,000, or 27.8%, to $149,700,000 in fiscal 2016 from $117,156,000 in fiscal 2015. The 27.8% increase in net sales consist of (i) an increase of 12.5% in organic sales, (ii) an increase of 17.5% in net sales due to acquisitions, and (iii) a decrease of 2.2% in net sales due to foreign currency translation.\nThe increase in both domestic and international organic net sales for fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to increases in net sales of our endoscopy products and services due to increases in demand for (i) endoscope reprocessing equipment, (ii) higher margin products such as disposable infection control products used in GI endoscopy procedures, and (iii) endoscope reprocessing disinfectants and service as a result of the increased field population of equipment, as further described below in Endoscopy Segment.\u201d\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased by $55,719,000 or 22.0%, to $309,186,000 in fiscal 2016 from $253,467,000 in fiscal 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2016 and 2015 was 46.5% and 44.9%, respectively. Excluding the impact of acquisition accounting charges, gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2016 and 2015 was 46.7% and 45.2%, respectively.\nThe higher gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2016 and 2015 was primarily attributable to (i) more favorable sales mix due to increases in sales volume of certain products that carry higher gross margin percentages such as our procedure room products and disinfectants in our Endoscopy segment, sterility assurance and waterline disinfection products in our Healthcare Disposables segment and sterilants and filters in our Water Purification and Filtration segment, (ii) the inclusion of higher margin sales in our Endoscopy and Healthcare Disposables segments as a result of the MI and NAMSA Acquisitions, respectively, (iii) lower manufacturing costs and (iv) decrease of $2,334,000 in medical device excise tax due to the recent moratorium, as further explained below, partially offset by an increase in net sales of lower margin capital equipment primarily in our Endoscopy segment and higher charges for warranty primarily relating to our water purification equipment.\nWe cannot provide assurances that our gross profit percentage will not be adversely affected in the future (i) by uncertainties associated with our product mix, (ii) by price competition, or (iii) if raw materials and distribution costs increase and we are unable to implement offsetting price increases.\nIn December 2015, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 was signed into law and included a two-year moratorium effective January 1, 2016 on the medical device excise tax, which was a tax on medical device manufacturers in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on all U.S. medical device sales. A significant portion of our net sales are considered U.S. medical device sales and therefore our gross profit percentage will continue to be favorably impacted by this moratorium until the two-year moratorium expires. However, we are investing a significant portion of the savings from this moratorium into sales and marketing and product development initiatives.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling expenses increased by $18,275,000, or 22.6%, to $99,062,000 in fiscal 2016 from $80,787,000 in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, selling expenses increased primarily due to (i) higher commission expense relating to increased net sales in our Endoscopy segment, (ii) increased sales and marketing initiatives to expand into new markets, including\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ninternational markets, and to gain or maintain market share by hiring and training additional sales and marketing personnel and increasing travel budgets in our Endoscopy, Water Purification and Filtration and Healthcare Disposables segments, (iii) the inclusion of selling and marketing expenses of acquisitions, and (iv) increases in annual salaries. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $884,000 in selling expense for fiscal 2016 relating to our specialty packaging business divested in April 2015.\nSelling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 14.9% in fiscal 2016 compared with 14.3% in fiscal 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $19,566,000, or 25.1%, to $97,463,000 in fiscal 2016 from $77,897,000 in fiscal 2015. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to (i) the inclusion of general and administrative expenses of our acquisitions, (ii) the impact of atypical items relating to acquisitions and costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Executive Officer, partially offset by the prior year impairment of an acquired license, as further described below and within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, and (iii) increases in annual salaries and incentive compensation including stock-based compensation.\nExcluding (i) current and prior year amortization expense, (ii) current and prior year acquisition related items such as transaction and integration charges and fair value adjustments, (iii) current year costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Executive Officer and (iv) the prior year impairment of an acquired license, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, general and administrative expenses increased by $14,880,000, or 23.3%, to $78,627,000 in fiscal 2016. Approximately a third of these increases are attributable to the inclusion of general and administrative expenses of our acquisitions.\nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 14.7% in fiscal 2016 compared with 13.8% in fiscal 2015.\nResearch and development expenses (which include continuing engineering costs) increased by $1,388,000, or 9.9%, to $15,410,000 in fiscal 2016 from $14,022,000 in fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to additional product development initiatives primarily in our Endoscopy segment, including the inclusion of projects relating to recent acquisitions.\nResearch and development expense as a percentage of net sales were 2.3% and 2.5% in fiscals 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInterest\nInterest expense increased by $976,000 to $3,408,000 in fiscal 2016 from $2,432,000 in fiscal 2015, as a result of an increase in the average outstanding borrowings due to the funding of the MI and NAMSA Acquisitions in September 2015 and March 2016, respectively.\nInterest income increased by $20,000 to $88,000 in fiscal 2016 from $68,000 in fiscal 2015.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIncome Taxes\nThe decrease in the consolidated effective tax rate in fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, was due to the (i) adverse impact of the divesture of our specialty packaging business in the prior year and (ii) the favorable impact in the current year from the enactment of tax legislation in the United States and internationally, partially offset by higher non-deductible acquisition related items in fiscal 2016, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A. Additionally, the current year consolidated effective tax rate was favorably impacted by improved operating results of our international operations, which are located in lower tax rate jurisdictions. A reconciliation of the consolidated effective income rate for fiscals 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConsolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEffective\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncome Tax Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDifferential attributable to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition related items, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on sale of business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.1) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNew tax legislation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.7) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInternational operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.6) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.1) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFiscal 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n36.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEndoscopy Segment\nNet sales of endoscopy products and services increased by $93,098,000, or 37.4%, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015. The 37.4% increase in net sales consist of (i) an increase of 28.0% in organic net sales, (ii) an increase of 10.2% in net sales due to acquisitions and (iii) decrease of 0.8% in net sales due to foreign currency translation. The increase in organic net sales was primarily due to increases in demand in the United States and internationally for our (i) procedure room products (disposable infection control products used in GI endoscopy procedures) due to sales and marketing efforts, (ii) endoscope reprocessing equipment due to our sales and marketing programs and (iii) disinfectants and service due to the increase in the installed base of endoscope reprocessing equipment. We expect sales of disinfectants, service, filters and equipment accessories, most of which carry higher margins, to continue to benefit as we increase the installed base of endoscope reprocessing equipment. These increases were partially offset by overall lower selling prices principally related to endoscopy reprocessing equipment and procedure room products as a result of our strategic growth plan and increased competition.\nThe Endoscopy segment's operating income increased by $20,158,000, or 49.3%, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to increases in sales in the United States and internationally for our endoscopy products and services, as further explained above, and to a much lesser extent, the inclusion of operating income from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by (i) higher commission expense and other incentive compensation, (ii) increased investment in our sales team and other selling initiatives, (iii) a net unfavorable impact from atypical items, as further described below and within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A and (iv) an increase in annual salaries. Excluding amortization expense as well as atypical items relating to current and prior year acquisition related items and a prior year license impairment, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, the Endoscopy segment's operating income increased by $21,746,000, or 44.4% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015.\nWater Purification and Filtration Segment\nNet sales of water purification and filtration products and services increased by $3,835,000, or 2.2%, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015. The 2.2% increase in net sales consist of (i) an increase of 1.0% in organic net sales, (ii) an increase of 1.6% in net sales due to acquisitions and (iii) decrease of 0.4% in net sales due to foreign currency translation. The increase in organic net sales was primarily due to an increase in demand for our (i) sterilants products, (ii) service and (iii) water purification equipment used for commercial and industrial (large capital) applications.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Water Purification and Filtration segment's operating income increased by $14,000, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of higher sales, partially offset by increases in annual salaries, the hiring of additional sales personnel, increased travel budgets and higher charges for warranty related to our water purification equipment.\nHealthcare Disposables Segment\nNet sales of healthcare disposables products increased by $5,664,000, or 5.3%, in fiscal 2016 when compared with fiscal 2015. The 5.3% increase in net sales consist of (i) increase of 0.3% in organic net sales and (ii) increase of 5.0% in net sales due to acquisitions. Organic net sales for fiscal 2016 were similar to fiscal 2015 as the increase in sales of sterility assurance and waterline disinfection products in the current year were offset by the elevated demand during the first half of the prior year for our face masks and certain sterilization products as a result of (i) customers buying products in advance of certain sales price increases and (ii) customer response to the Ebola virus.\nThe Healthcare Disposables segment's operating income increased by $4,582,000, or 23.0%, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to (i) the inclusion of sales relating to acquisitions, (ii) less amortization expense and (iii) lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by increases to annual salaries and the hiring of additional sales personnel. Excluding amortization expense, and to a much lesser extent acquisition related items, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, the Healthcare Disposables segment's operating income increased by $2,857,000, or 11.6% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015.\nDialysis Segment\nNet sales of dialysis products and services increased by $1,510,000, or 4.8% in fiscal 2016 when compared with fiscal 2015, principally due to (i) an increase in demand for our concentrate product by a single customer, which demand is expected to decline in fiscal 2017, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our sterilant products and RENATRON\u00ae reprocessing equipment due to the market shift from reusable to single-use dialyzers, as further described below.\nThe Dialysis segment's operating income increased by $1,158,000, or 17.2% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to (i) an increase in sales for our low margin concentrate product to a single customer and (ii) successful cost control initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our higher margin sterilant products and RENATRON\u00ae reprocessing equipment.\nWith the exception of fiscal 2016 that had increased sales of low margin concentrate products, which is a product not used in dialyzer reprocessing, sales in our Dialysis segment in recent years have been adversely impacted by the decrease in demand for our sterilants and RENATRON\u00ae reprocessing equipment principally due to the shift from reusable to single-use dialyzers as a result of the declining cost of single-use dialyzers, the ease of using a dialyzer one time, and the commitment of Fresenius Medical Care, the largest dialysis provider chain in the United States and a manufacturer of single-use dialyzers, to convert dialysis clinics performing reuse to single-use facilities. In addition, DaVita, a customer who accounted for approximately 18.0% of net sales in this segment, has converted certain clinics from reuse to single-use and in many cases utilizes single-use when opening new clinics. Based on discussions with customers, we expect the downward trend in reuse dialyzers in the United States to continue during fiscal 2017 and thereafter. A substantial decrease in the market for reprocessing products is likely to result in a significant loss of net sales and a lower level of profitability and operating cash flow in this segment in the future as well as potential future impairments of long-lived assets. Such reduction would also adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. See Risk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nGeneral Corporate Expenses\nGeneral corporate expenses relate to unallocated corporate costs primarily related to executive management personnel as well as costs associated with certain facets of our acquisition program and being a publicly traded company. Such expenses increased by $8,304,000, or 44.9% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to (i) $3,487,000 of costs recorded in the second half of fiscal 2016 associated with the retirement of our Chief Executive\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOfficer, (ii) the addition of internal and external resources to address various growth initiatives and compliance requirements, (iii) increases in costs associated with our acquisition program and (iv) increases in annual salaries and incentive compensation, including stock-based compensation expense.\nFiscal 2015 compared with Fiscal 2014\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nNet Sales\nTotal net sales increased by $76,255,000, or 15.6%, to $565,004,000 in fiscal 2015 from $488,749,000 in fiscal 2014. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions and the business divestiture, total organic sales increased by $44,179,000, or 9.2%. The increase in organic net sales for fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to increases in net sales of our endoscopy and water purification and filtration products and services and healthcare disposables products, as further described below in Endoscopy Segment,\u201d Water Purification and Filtration Segment\u201d and Healthcare Disposables Segment.\u201d\nInternational net sales increased by $32,299,000, or 38.1%, to $117,156,000 in fiscal 2015 from $84,857,000 in fiscal 2014. The increase in international net sales was primarily due to increases in net sales of endoscopy products and services in the United Kingdom and Italy as a result of the acquisitions of PuriCore and IMS. A significant portion of the net sales of the acquired United Kingdom business relates to product service, and therefore the acquisition was a significant reason for our worldwide product service net sales to increase by $17,130,000, or 31.6%, to $71,348,000 in fiscal 2015 from $54,218,000 in fiscal 2014.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased by $40,168,000, or 18.8%, to $253,467,000 in fiscal 2015 from $213,299,000 in fiscal 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2015 and 2014 was 44.9% and 43.6%, respectively.\nThe higher gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2015 and 2014, was primarily attributable to more favorable sales mix due to increases in sales volume of certain products that carry higher gross margin percentages such as our (i) sterilants, filters and procedure products in our Endoscopy segment, (ii) sterilants, filters and certain equipment products in our Water Purification and Filtration segment, and (iii) face masks, disinfectants, sterility assurance products and our acquired DentaPure products in our Healthcare Disposables segment. These items were partially offset by (i) acquisition accounting charges for fiscal 2015 of $1,981,000, relating to fair value adjustments of inventory and deferred revenue acquired in the acquisitions of DentaPure, IMS and PuriCore and (ii) the inclusion in our Endoscopy segment of the PuriCore Acquisition, which had a lower gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisition accounting charges, gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2015 and 2014 were 45.2% and 43.6%, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling expenses increased by $14,268,000, or 21.5%, to $80,787,000 in fiscal 2015 from $66,519,000 in fiscal 2014 primarily due to (i) increased sales and marketing initiatives to expand into new markets, including international markets, and gain or maintain market share by hiring and training additional sales and marketing personnel and increasing travel budgets in our Endoscopy and Water Purification and Filtration segments and to a lesser extent, our Healthcare Disposables segment, (ii) the inclusion of selling and marketing expenses of DentaPure, PWS, IMS and PuriCore in fiscal 2015, (iii) higher commission expense principally in our Endoscopy segment as a result of higher sales and (iv) increases in annual salaries.\nSelling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 14.3% in fiscal 2015 compared with 13.6% in fiscal 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $12,858,000, or 19.8%, to $77,897,000 in fiscal 2015 from $65,039,000 in fiscal 2014 primarily due to (i) the inclusion of general and administrative expenses of DentaPure, PWS\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nand IMS for the portion of fiscal 2015 subsequent to their acquisition dates, (ii) the inclusion of general and administrative expenses of Jet Prep, Sterilator and PuriCore for the portion of fiscal 2014 subsequent to their fiscal 2014 acquisition dates compared with twelve months of such expenses in fiscal 2015, (iii) an increase of $2,624,000 in intangible amortization as a result of acquisitions, (iv) an increase of $1,308,000 in acquisition related charges primarily in our Endoscopy segment, (v) a $1,287,000 asset impairment charge in fiscal 2015 relating to an acquired license in our Endoscopy segment, and (vi) increases in annual salaries and incentive compensation including stock-based compensation. These items were partially offset by a favorable net change of $2,804,000 in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 for fair value adjustments of contingent liabilities primarily associated with the Jet Prep Acquisition in our Endoscopy segment, as further described elsewhere in this MD&A and in Notes 3 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as fiscal 2014 costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Financial Officer. Excluding (i) current and prior year amortization expense, (ii) current and prior year significant acquisition related items such as transaction and integration charges and fair value adjustments, (iii) the current year impairment of an acquired license, and (iv) prior year costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Financial Officer, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, general and administrative expenses increased by $11,087,000, or 21.1%, to $63,747,000 in fiscal 2015 from $52,660,000 in fiscal 2014.\nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 13.8% in fiscal 2015 compared with 13.3% in fiscal 2014.\nResearch and development expenses (which include continuing engineering costs) increased by $3,209,000, or 29.7%, to $14,022,000 in fiscal 2015 from $10,813,000 in fiscal 2014 primarily due to additional product development initiatives primarily in our Endoscopy segment, including the inclusion of projects relating to the acquired PuriCore and IMS businesses.\nResearch and development expense as a percentage of net sales were 2.5% and 2.2% in fiscals 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nInterest\nInterest expense increased by $52,000 to $2,432,000 from $2,380,000 in fiscal 2015, compared with fiscal 2014, as a result of an increase in the average outstanding borrowings due to the funding of acquisitions, partially offset by the recording of an $113,000 charge in fiscal 2014 for the ineffective hedge on our term credit facility and an $84,000 charge in fiscal 2014 to expense the remaining debt issuance costs on our term credit facility, as further explained in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest income increased by $5,000 to $68,000 in fiscal 2015 from $63,000 in fiscal 2014.\nLoss on Sale of Business\nIn fiscal 2015, we conducted a strategic review of our Specialty Packaging business and evaluated its potential value in the marketplace relative to the business's historic and expected returns and concluded that the business was not part of our core strategy and could return a higher value to stockholders by its divestiture. Accordingly, our Specialty Packaging business (reported in the Other reporting segment) was classified as held-for-sale within our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet beginning October 31, 2014. Since the operating results of the Specialty Packaging segment, as shown in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, were not significant in relation to our overall consolidated operating results, the lack of operating results from this business due to its divestiture did not have a major effect on our operations and financial results, and accordingly, has not been classified as a discontinued operation for any of the periods presented.\nOn April 7, 2015, we completed the sale of our Specialty Packaging business to a global packaging and service company by selling all the issued and outstanding stock of our Specialty Packaging subsidiary in exchange for $7,531,000 in cash proceeds, of which $660,000 is held in escrow for indemnity obligations, if any, until October 7, 2016 and is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, we\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nincurred approximately $1,128,000 in costs associated with the disposition of this business including bonuses associated with the sale, accelerated stock-based compensation and to a lesser extent certain advisory fees. Furthermore as a result of this disposition, we recognized a foreign currency translation gain of $1,264,000 in our Consolidated Statement of Income, which was recorded in stockholders' equity immediately preceding the disposition. Such foreign currency translation gain was a result of the monthly translation of the Specialty Packaging segment's balance sheets beginning in 2004, when the business was acquired. In addition, due to the inability to currently deduct a capital loss and the uncertainty of utilizing a capital loss tax benefit in the future, a tax benefit was not recognized on a portion of the recorded loss on sale of the business. Overall, this transaction, including costs associated with the disposition and the recognition of a foreign currency translation gain, resulted in a $2,206,000 loss, or $0.04 in diluted earnings per share, which was recorded in loss on sale of business in our Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2015. Such amount is subject to further adjustments for indemnity obligations, if any.\nIncome Taxes\nA reconciliation of the consolidated effective income tax rate for fiscals 2015 and 2014 is as follows:\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConsolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEffective\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncome Tax Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFiscal 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n36.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDifferential attributable to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on sale of business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition related items, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.3) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInternational operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFiscal 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe consolidated effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 was adversely affected by initial operating losses of our international operations located in lower tax rate jurisdictions, as well as the $2,206,000 loss on sale of our Specialty Packaging business, as further described elsewhere in this MD&A and in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to the inability to currently deduct a capital loss and the uncertainty of utilizing a capital loss tax benefit in the future, a tax benefit was not recognized on a portion of the loss on sale of the Specialty Packaging business, thereby increasing our consolidated effective tax rate.\nThese unfavorable items were offset by the impact of recording acquisition related items consisting of net favorable acquisition related fair value adjustments recorded in general and administrative expenses relating to the Jet Prep Acquisition that were not tax effected due to the structure of the acquisition, partially offset by non-deductible acquisition related charges.\nEndoscopy Segment\nNet sales of endoscopy products and services increased by $58,214,000, or 30.6%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014, primarily due to increases in demand in the United States and internationally for our (i) disinfectants, service, equipment accessories and filters due to the increase in the installed base of endoscope reprocessing equipment, (ii) procedure room products (disposable infection control products used in GI endoscopy procedures) and (iii) endoscope reprocessing equipment. Additionally, the increase in fiscal 2015 was attributable to the inclusion of net sales generated in the United Kingdom and Italy as a result of acquiring PuriCore on June 30, 2014 and IMS on November 3, 2014. Excluding the incremental net sales provided by these acquisitions, organic net sales in our Endoscopy segment increased by 15.5% for fiscal 2015. These increases were partially offset by overall lower selling prices in most endoscopy product offerings totaling approximately $4,100,000 as a result of strategic growth programs and increased competition, as well as the adverse impact on international sales of a stronger dollar relative to the euro, which accounted for approximately a third of the lower selling prices.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Endoscopy segment's operating income increased by $6,669,000, or 19.5%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to increases in demand in the United States and internationally for our endoscopy products and services, as further explained above, and a favorable net change of $2,804,000 in general and administrative expenses relating to fair value contingent liabilities adjustments that were favorable in fiscal 2015 compared to moderately unfavorable in fiscal 2014, as further described Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These items were partially offset by (i) increased investment in our sales team and other selling initiatives, (ii) lower selling prices of certain endoscopy products, (iii) an increase in acquisition related charges, (iv) increased research and development expenses due to additional product development initiatives, (v) increased intangible amortization as a result of acquisitions, (vi) a $1,287,000 asset impairment charge in fiscal 2015 relating to an acquired license, and (vii) increases in annual salaries and incentive compensation. Excluding the fair value adjustments, acquisition related charges and the asset impairment stated above and further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, the Endoscopy segment's operating income increased by $7,922,000, or 22.5% in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014.\nWater Purification and Filtration Segment\nNet sales of water purification and filtration products and services increased by $14,329,000, or 8.9%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily attributable to (i) higher sales of our capital equipment, consumables and service in the dialysis industry mainly attributable to our expanding service network as well as the increased overall demand driven by the growing number of dialysis patients and clinics in the United States and the increasing market acceptance of the disinfection efficacy and cost benefits of our heat sanitized water purification systems, which carry higher average selling prices than the systems with the traditional non-heated sanitization and to a much lesser extent (ii) the inclusion of net sales generated by the PWS Acquisition. Excluding net sales relating to the PWS Acquisition, organic net sales in our Water Purification and Filtration segment increased by 6.8% for fiscal 2015.\nThe Water Purification and Filtration segment's operating income increased by $4,856,000, or 18.9%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of higher sales and improved gross profit percentage, as further explained above, partially offset by increases in annual salaries and the hiring of additional sales personnel.\nHealthcare Disposables Segment\nNet sales of healthcare disposables products increased by $5,111,000, or 5.0%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 principally due to increases in customer demand in the United States for our face masks, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA)-based high-level disinfectant and sterility assurance products as well as the inclusion of net sales generated by the DentaPure Acquisition, which was completed on February 20, 2015. Excluding net sales relating to the DentaPure Acquisition, organic net sales in our Healthcare Disposables segment increased by 3.7% for fiscal 2015.\nThe Healthcare Disposables segment's operating income increased by $1,184,000, or 6.3% in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in net sales, as further explained above, partially offset by (i) an increase of $280,000 of acquisition related charges primarily relating to the fair value adjustment of DentaPure's inventory, (ii) the hiring of additional sales personnel, and (iii) annual salary raises. Excluding acquisition related charges further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, the Healthcare Disposables segment's operating income increased by $1,464,000, or 7.8% in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014.\nDialysis Segment\nThe Dialysis segment's operating income decreased by $798,000, or 10.6%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to a decrease in demand for our sterilant product and RENATRON\u00ae dialyzer reprocessing equipment, partially offset by an increase in demand for our low margin concentrate product. See Risk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this form 10-K.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nSpecialty Packaging\nThe operating income of our Specialty Packaging business, which was reported in the Other reporting segment and divested on April 7, 2015, as further described elsewhere in this MD&A and in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, increased by $303,000 for the portion of fiscal 2015 prior to its divestiture compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in demand for our specialty packaging products resulting from the Ebola virus as well as recording foreign exchange gains associated with translating certain United States dollar denominated assets into our subsidiary's functional currency, the Canadian dollar.\nGeneral Corporate Expenses\nGeneral corporate expenses relate to unallocated corporate costs primarily related to executive management personnel, costs associated with certain facets of our acquisition program and being a publicly traded company. Such expenses increased by $2,381,000, or 14.8%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to (i) the addition of internal and external resources to address various growth initiatives and compliance requirements, (ii) costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Financial Officer and recruiting of executive personnel, (iii) increases in costs associated with our acquisition program, and (iv) increases in annual salaries and stock-based compensation.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn evaluating our operating performance, we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) with certain internally driven non-GAAP financial measures, namely (i) non-GAAP net income, (ii) non-GAAP diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d), (iii) income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense ( EBITDAS\u201d), (iv) EBITDAS adjusted for atypical items ( Adjusted EBITDAS\u201d), (v) net debt and (vi) organic sales. These non-GAAP financial measures are indicators of the Company's performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. They are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to financial information used by us in our financial analysis and operational decision-making. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors, shareholders and other readers of our Consolidated Financial Statements in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from, or as an alternative to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nWe define non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS as net income and diluted EPS, respectively, adjusted to exclude amortization, acquisition related items, significant reorganization and restructuring charges, major tax events and other significant items management deems atypical or non-operating in nature.\nFor fiscal 2016, we made adjustments to net income and diluted EPS to exclude (i) amortization expense, (ii) significant acquisition related items impacting current operating performance including transaction and integration charges and ongoing fair value adjustments, (iii) costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Executive Officer and (iv) the impact of favorable tax legislation to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS.\nFor fiscal 2015, we made adjustments to net income and diluted EPS to exclude (i) amortization expense, (ii) significant acquisition related items impacting current operating performance including transaction and integration charges and ongoing fair value adjustments, (iii) the loss on sale of our Specialty Packaging business and (iv) the impairment of an acquired license to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS.\nFor fiscal 2014, we made adjustments to net income and diluted EPS to exclude (i) amortization expense, (ii) significant acquisition related items impacting current operating performance primarily relating to transaction charges and ongoing fair value adjustments, and (iii) costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Financial Officer to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAmortization expense is a non-cash expense related to intangibles that were primarily the result of business acquisitions. Our history of acquiring businesses has resulted in significant increases in amortization of intangible assets that reduced the Company's net income. The removal of amortization from our overall operating performance helps in assessing our cash generated from operations including our return on invested capital, which we believe is an important analysis for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our continued growth.\nAcquisition related items consist of (i) fair value adjustments to contingent consideration and other contingent liabilities resulting from acquisitions, (ii) due diligence, integration, legal fees and other transaction costs associated with our acquisition program and (iii) acquisition accounting charges for the amortization of the initial fair value adjustments of acquired inventory and deferred revenue. The adjustments of contingent consideration and other contingent liabilities are periodic adjustments to record such amounts at fair value at each balance sheet date. Given the subjective nature of the assumptions used in the determination of fair value calculations, fair value adjustments may potentially cause significant earnings volatility that are not representative of our operating results. Similarly, due diligence, integration, legal and other acquisition costs associated with our acquisition program, including acquisition accounting charges relating to recording acquired inventory and deferred revenue at fair market value, can be significant and also adversely impact our effective tax rate as certain costs are often not tax-deductible. Since all of these acquisition related items are atypical and often mask underlying operating performance, we excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to past operating performance.\nIn fiscal 2016, we announced the retirement plans of our Chief Executive Officer and recorded the majority of the costs associated with his retirement in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Since these costs are atypical and masks our underlying operating performance, we made an adjustment to our net income and EPS for fiscal 2016 to exclude such costs to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures.\nTax legislation was enacted in the United States and internationally that enabled us to record favorable tax benefits in our second quarter of fiscal 2016 relating to the entire calendar 2015. Since these favorable tax benefits are largely unrelated to our current year's income before taxes and is unrepresentative of our normal effective tax rate, we excluded its impact on net income and EPS for fiscal 2016 for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current performance and a comparison to past performance.\nOn April 7, 2015, we completed the sale of our Specialty Packaging business to a global packaging and service company, as further described elsewhere in this MD&A and in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overall, this transaction, including costs associated with the disposition and the recognition of a foreign currency translation gain, resulted in a $2,206,000 loss, or $0.04 in diluted earnings per share, which was recorded in loss on sale of business in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Since the divestiture of a business is atypical and non-operating in nature and the loss on sale masks our underlying operating performance, we excluded the loss on sale of business for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures for fiscal 2015.\nIn September 2013, we acquired a license from a third party granting us the exclusive right to manufacture, commercialize, distribute and sell an endoscopy product in its beginning stage of commercialization in exchange for a series of payments, which totaled $1,000,000 by our second quarter of fiscal 2015 and was recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We evaluated this long-lived asset in fiscal 2015 for potential impairment and determined that the future use of this acquired license was unlikely based on a recent product analysis. Accordingly, we deemed the acquired license, together with related fixed assets of $287,000 to be fully impaired and recorded a loss of $1,287,000 during fiscal 2015, which was recorded in general and administrative expenses and as reductions in other assets and property and equipment in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Since the acquisition of the license and subsequent impairment were outside our standard endoscopy business operations, we excluded the impairment of the acquired license for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to past operating performance.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe reconciliations of net income to non-GAAP net income were calculated as follows:\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJuly 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Amounts in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income, as reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n59,953 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n47,953 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n43,265 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIntangible amortization (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,095 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,265 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,641 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition related items (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,213 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,579 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,150 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCEO retirement costs (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,487 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCFO retirement costs (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on sale of business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,206 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nImpairment of acquired license (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,287 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax benefit on above adjustments (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,010) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,251) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,261) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTax legislative changes (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(800) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNon-GAAP net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n72,938 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n60,039 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n51,384 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmounts are recorded in general and administrative expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIn fiscal 2016, acquisition related items of $959 and $2,254 were recorded in cost of sales and general administrative expenses, respectively.

In particular, acquisitions have historically resulted in significant increases in amortization of intangible assets that reduce the Company's net income. Additionally, we regard EBITDAS as a useful measure of operating performance and cash flow before the effect of interest expense and is a complement to operating income, net income and other GAAP financial performance measures.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDAS as EBITDAS excluding the same atypical items as previously described as adjustments to net income. We use Adjusted EBITDAS when evaluating the operating performance of the Company because we believe the exclusion of such atypical items, of which a significant portion are non-cash items, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of on-going core operating results and to evaluate comparative results period over period.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe reconciliations of net income to EBITDAS and Adjusted EBITDAS were calculated as follows:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJuly 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(Amounts in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income, as reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n59,953 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n47,953 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n43,265 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,320 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,364 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,317 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n33,978 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28,238 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25,346 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,989 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,692 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,245 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,095 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,265 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,641 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on disposal of fixed assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,361 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,867 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,409 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEBITDAS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n131,249 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n108,739 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n95,724 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAcquisition related items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,213 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,579 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,150 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCEO retirement costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,487 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCFO retirement costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss on sale of business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,206 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nImpairment of acquired license\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,287 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted EBITDAS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n137,949 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n113,811 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n97,463 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe define net debt as long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents.

We believe that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior periods. We exclude the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size, and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and can obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of financial performance difficult. The reconciliation of net sales to organic sales can be found elsewhere in this MD&A in Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015.\u201d\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nAt July 31, 2016, our working capital was $126,407,000, compared with $117,737,000 at July 31, 2015.

The fiscal 2016 net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the MI and NAMSA Acquisitions, partially offset by repayments under our credit facility.\nIn fiscal 2015, net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to repayments under our credit facility, partially offset by borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the acquisitions of IMS, PWS and DentaPure acquisitions.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn fiscal 2014, net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to repayments under our credit

The 2014 Credit Agreement includes a five-year $250,000,000 senior secured revolving facility with sublimits of up to $100,000,000 for borrowings in foreign currencies, $30,000,000 for letters of credit and $10,000,000 for swing line loans (the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent including the consent of the lenders, the Company may from time to time increase the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed $100,000,000. The senior lenders include Bank of America N.A. (the lead bank and administrative agent), PNC Bank, National Association, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The 2014 Credit Agreement expires on March 4, 2019. Additionally, subject to certain restrictions and conditions (i) any of our domestic or foreign subsidiaries may become borrowers and (ii) borrowings may occur in multi-currencies.\nBorrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement bear interest at rates ranging from 0.25% to 1.25% above the lender's base rate, or at rates ranging from 1.25% to 2.25% above the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d), depending upon the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio,\u201d which is defined as the consolidated ratio of total funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and as further adjusted under the terms of the 2014 Credit Agreement ( Consolidated EBITDA\u201d). At September 29, 2016, the lender's base rate was 3.50% and the LIBOR rates ranged from 0.52% to 1.33%. The margins applicable to our outstanding borrowings were 0.50% above the lender's base rate or 1.50% above LIBOR. All of our outstanding borrowings were under LIBOR contracts at September 29, 2016. The 2014 Credit Agreement also provides for fees on the unused portion of our facility at rates ranging from 0.20% to 0.40%, depending upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio; such rate was 0.25% at September 29, 2016.\nThe 2014 Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants reasonably customary for similar credit facilities and is secured by (i) substantially all assets of Cantel and its United States-based subsidiaries, (ii) a pledge by Cantel of all of the outstanding shares of its United States-based subsidiaries and 65% of the outstanding shares of certain of Cantel's foreign-based subsidiaries, and (iii) a guaranty by Cantel's domestic subsidiaries. We are in compliance with all financial and other covenants under the 2014 Credit Agreement.\nOn July 31, 2016, we had $116,000,000 of outstanding borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement. Subsequent to July 31, 2016, we borrowed $61,000,000 to fund the purchase price and transaction costs of the Accutron and Vantage acquisitions and repaid $6,000,000 resulting in total outstanding borrowings of $171,000,000 at September 29, 2016, none of which is required to be repaid until March 2019.\nWith respect to interest rate risk, since our credit facility consists of outstanding debt at prevailing market rates of interest, principally under LIBOR contracts ranging from one to twelve months, our market risk with respect to such debt is the increase in interest expense which would result from higher interest rates associated with LIBOR. Our outstanding debt of $171,000,000 at September 29, 2016 has expected annual interest payments of approximately $3,830,000 using an effective interest rate of 2.24% as described above. Therefore, a 100 basis-point increase in average LIBOR interest rates would result in incremental interest expense of approximately $1,710,000. We monitor our interest rate risk, but presently do not utilize any interest rate derivatives that would mitigate our interest rate exposure. However, all of our outstanding borrowings were under LIBOR contracts at September 29, 2016 that have expiration dates ranging from one to twelve months at fixed interest rates for the contract periods; therefore, we are substantially protected throughout the majority of fiscal 2017 from any significant exposure associated with increasing LIBOR rates, assuming we do not increase our outstanding debt. Additionally, we maintained a cash balance of $28,367,000 at July 31, 2016 which is maintained in cash or invested in low risk and low return cash equivalents such as United States money market funds with leading banking institutions. An increase in interest rates would generate additional interest\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nincome for us from these low risk cash equivalents, which would partially offset the adverse impact of the additional interest expense. Our other long-term liabilities would not be materially affected by an increase in interest rates.\nOperating Leases\nMinimum commitments under operating leases include minimum rental commitments for our leased manufacturing facilities, warehouses, office space and equipment.\nRent expense related to operating leases for fiscal 2016 was recorded on a straight-line basis and aggregated $6,675,000, compared with $6,025,000 and $4,409,000 for fiscals 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAssumed Contingent Liabilities\nIn relation to the Jet Prep Acquisition, we have recorded at July 31, 2016 a $1,138,000 liability for the estimated fair value of an assumed contingent obligation payable to the Israeli Government, as further described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which will be payable based on future sales of the Jet Prep Business. Additionally, in connection with the PuriCore Acquisition, we assumed a contingent guaranteed obligation to reimburse an endoscope service company for endoscope repair costs it incurs when servicing its customers' endoscopes that are damaged by one of PuriCore's discontinued endoscope reprocessing machine models, as further described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As such, the estimates of the annual required payments as well as the fair value of these contingent liabilities are subjective in nature and highly dependent on future sales projections. Additionally, since we will be continually re-measuring these liabilities at each balance sheet date and recording changes in the respective fair values through our Consolidated Statements of Income, we may potentially have earnings volatility in our future results of operations until the assumed contingent obligation and contingent guaranteed obligation are satisfied, or until the sales of the Jet Prep products no longer exist.\nCompensation Agreements\nWe have previously entered into various severance contracts with executives of the Company, including our corporate executive officers and certain of our subsidiary Chief Executive Officers, which define certain compensation arrangements relating to various employment termination scenarios, and multi-year employment agreements with certain executive officers of businesses we have acquired. Additionally, in March 2016 we entered into a succession plan agreement due to the planned retirement of our Chief Executive Officer who was succeeded on July 31, 2016, but remains employed as a Senior Advisor until October 15, 2016. This succession plan agreement requires future payments to our former Chief Executive Officer beginning in fiscal 2017 for transition-related services. The majority of those future payments are being recorded in general and administrative expenses from March 17, 2016 through his October 15, 2016 retirement date.\nOther Long-Term Obligation\nIn relation to the IMS Acquisition on November 3, 2014, we assumed an $843,000 liability to the central bank of Italy as part of funding provided by an Italian government agency, of which $187,000 and $656,000 were recorded in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. Such amount was a portion of the financial support obtained from the Italian government's Ministry of Education, Universities and Research to fund research and development activity relating to IMS's automated endoscope reprocessors. The liability is payable in semi-annual installments, bears interest at 0.25% per annum and has a maturity date of January 1, 2019. At July 31, 2016, $415,000 is outstanding, of which $165,000 is recorded in accrued expense and $250,000 is recorded in other long-term liabilities.\nAdditionally, other long-term obligations include deferred compensation arrangements for certain former Medivators directors and officers and is recorded in other long-term liabilities.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFinancing Needs\nOur operating segments generate significant cash from operations. At July 31, 2016, we had a cash balance of $28,367,000, of which $9,804,000 was held by foreign subsidiaries. Our foreign cash is needed by our foreign subsidiaries for working capital purposes as well as for current international growth initiatives. Accordingly, our foreign unremitted earnings are considered permanently reinvested and unavailable for repatriation.\nWe believe that our current cash position, anticipated cash flows from operations and the funds available under our 2014 Credit Agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our worldwide cash operating requirements for the foreseeable future based upon our existing operations, particularly given that we historically have not needed to borrow for working capital purposes. At September 29, 2016, $79,000,000 was available under our 2014 Credit Agreement.\nForeign Currency Market Risk\nChanges in the value of the Euro, British Pound, Singapore dollar, Canadian dollar and the Chinese Renminbi against the United States dollar affect our results of operations because certain cash bank accounts, accounts receivable and liabilities of Cantel and its subsidiaries are denominated and ultimately settled in United States dollars or these foreign currencies, but must be converted into each entity's functional currency. Furthermore, the financial statements of most of our international subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and therefore are impacted by changes in the international entities' functional currency relative to the United States dollar.\nWe use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency transactions. Market risk is defined here as the potential change in fair value resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. Overall for fiscals 2016 and 2015, a uniform 15% adverse movement in foreign currency rates would have resulted in realized losses (after tax) of approximately $1,680,000 and $1,371,000, respectively. Conversely, for fiscals 2016 and 2015, a uniform 15% favorable movement in foreign currency rates would have resulted in realized gains (after tax) of approximately $1,680,000 and $1,371,000, respectively.\nFor fiscals 2016 and 2015, the realized losses (after tax) would have resulted primarily from (i) increases in the values of the Euro and Canadian dollar relative to the United States dollar and (ii) decreases in the values of the British Pound and Singapore dollar relative to the United States dollar due to the composition of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' financials. However, the use of foreign currency forward contracts would partially offset such realized losses.\nIn order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the Euro, British Pound and Singapore dollar relative to the United States dollar on the conversion of such net assets into the functional currencies, we enter into short-term contracts to purchase Euros, British Pounds and Singapore dollars forward, which contracts are one-month in duration. These short-term contracts are designated as fair value hedge instruments. There were four foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate value of $7,039,000 at August 31, 2016, which covered certain assets and liabilities that were denominated in currencies other than each entity's functional currency. Such contracts expire on September 30, 2016. These foreign currency forward contracts are continually replaced with new one-month contracts as long as we have significant net assets that are denominated and ultimately settled in currencies other than each entity's functional currency. Gains and losses related to these hedging contracts to buy Euros, British Pounds and Singapore dollars forward are immediately realized within general and administrative expenses due to the short-term nature of such contracts. For fiscal 2016, such forward contracts partially offset the impact on operations related to certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than each entity's functional currency. We do not currently hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar and Chinese Renminbi relative to the United States dollar because the overall foreign currency exposures relating to those currencies are currently not deemed significant. Additionally, we do not hedge transactions associated with the funding of international acquisitions due to the short-term nature of the foreign currency exposure.\nOverall, fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange had an insignificant impact upon our net income in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFor purposes of translating the balance sheet at July 31, 2016 compared with July 31, 2015, the total of the foreign currency movements resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $13,019,000 for fiscal 2016, primarily due to the increase in the value of the United States dollar relative to the Euro, Canadian dollar and British Pound, thereby decreasing stockholders' equity.\nInflation\nAlthough overall inflation did not have a significant effect on our business, an increase in commodity prices can adversely affect our gross margins. Specifically, our businesses can be adversely impacted by rising fuel and oil prices and are heavily reliant on certain raw materials, such as chemicals, paper, resin, stainless steel and plastic components. From time to time, we experience price increases for raw materials. If we are unable to implement price increases to our customers, our gross margins could be adversely affected.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we continually evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue on product sales is recognized as products are shipped to customers and title passes. The passing of title is determined based upon the FOB terms specified for each shipment. With respect to endoscopy and dialysis products, shipment terms are generally FOB origin for common carrier and when our distribution fleet is utilized (except for one large customer in dialysis and several endoscopy customers whereby all products are shipped FOB destination). With respect to water purification and filtration and healthcare disposable products, shipment terms may be either FOB origin or destination. Customer acceptance for the majority of our product sales occurs at the time of delivery. With respect to a portion of water purification and filtration and endoscopy product sales, equipment is sold as part of a system for which the equipment is functionally interdependent or the customer's purchase order specifies ship-complete\u201d as a condition of delivery; revenue recognition on such sales is deferred until all equipment has been delivered, or post-delivery obligations such as installation have been substantially fulfilled such that the products are deemed functional by the end-user. All shipping and handling fees invoiced to customers, such as freight, are recorded as revenue (and related costs are included within cost of sales) at the time the sale is recognized.\nA portion of our endoscopy, water purification and filtration and dialysis sales are recognized as multiple element arrangements, whereby revenue is allocated to the equipment, installation and consumable components based upon vendor specific objective evidence, which includes comparable historical transactions of similar equipment, installation and consumables sold as stand-alone components. If vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price is not available, we allocate revenue to the elements of the bundled arrangement using the estimated selling price method in order to qualify the components as separate units of accounting. Revenue on the equipment and consumables components are recognized as the equipment or consumable is shipped to customers and title passes. Revenue on the installation component is recognized when the installation is complete.\nA portion of our healthcare disposables sales relating to the mail-in spore test kit is recorded as deferred revenue when initially sold. We recognize the revenue on these test kits using an estimate based on historical experience\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nof the amount of time that elapses from the point of sale to when the kit is returned to us and we communicate to the customer the results of the required laboratory test. The related cost of the kits is recorded in inventory and recognized in cost of sales as the revenue is earned.\nRevenue on service sales is recognized when repairs are completed at the customer's location or when repairs are completed at our facilities and the products are shipped to customers. With respect to certain service contracts in our Endoscopy and Water Purification and Filtration operating segments, service revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement.\nNone of our sales contain right-of-return provisions. Customer claims for credit or return due to damage, defect, shortage or other reason must be pre-approved by us before credit is issued or such product is accepted for return. No cash discounts for early payment are offered except with respect to a small portion of our product sales in each segment. We do not offer price protection, although advance pricing contracts or required notice periods prior to implementation of price increases exist for certain customers with respect to many of our products. With respect to certain of our dialysis, healthcare disposables, water purification and filtration and endoscopy customers, rebates are provided; such rebates, which consist primarily of volume rebates, are provided for as a reduction of sales at the time of revenue recognition and amounted to $5,944,000, $5,597,000, and $4,498,000 in fiscals 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Such allowances are determined based on estimated projections of sales volume for the entire rebate periods. If it becomes known that sales volume to customers will deviate from original projections, the rebate provisions originally established would be adjusted accordingly.\nOur endoscopy products and services are sold directly to hospitals and other end-users in the United States and primarily to distributors internationally except for the United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Singapore, China and Germany where we sell directly to hospitals and other end-users; water purification and filtration products and services are sold directly to hospitals, dialysis clinics, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, laboratories, medical products and service companies and other end-users as well as through third-party distributors; the majority of our healthcare disposable products are sold to third party distributors and with respect to some of our sterility assurance products, to hospitals, surgery centers, physician and dental offices, dental schools, medical research companies, laboratories and other end-users; and the majority of our dialysis products are sold to dialysis clinics and hospitals. Sales to all of these customers follow our revenue recognition policies.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities. Allowances for doubtful accounts are reserves for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments. We use historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate. While actual losses have historically been within management's expectations and provisions established, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Alternatively, if certain customers paid their delinquent receivables, reductions in allowances may be required.\nInventories\nInventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished products which are sold in the ordinary course of our business and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. In assessing the value of inventories, we must make estimates and judgments regarding reserves required for product obsolescence, aging of inventories and other issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products. In performing such evaluations, we use historical experience as well as current market information. With few exceptions, the saleable value of our inventories has historically been within management's expectation and provisions established, however, rapid changes in the market due to competition, technology and various other factors could have an adverse effect on the saleable value of our inventories, resulting in the need for additional reserves.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nCertain of our identifiable intangible assets, including customer relationships, technology, brand names, non-compete agreements and patents, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which range from 3 to 20 years. Additionally, we have recorded goodwill and trademarks and trade names, all of which have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not amortized. All of our intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, and goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Our management is responsible for determining if impairment exists and considers a number of factors, including third-party valuations, when making these determinations.\nWe first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount before proceeding to step one of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, if necessary. Such qualitative factors that are assessed include evaluating a segment's financial performance, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions and specific issues that can directly affect the segment such as changes in business strategies, competition, supplier relationships, operating costs, regulatory matters, litigation and the composition of the segment's assets due to acquisitions or other events. At July 31, 2016, because we determined through qualitative factors that the fair values of our Endoscopy, Water Purification and Filtration and Healthcare Disposables segments were unlikely to be less than the carrying value, we did not proceed to step one of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for those three segments. We performed step one of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for Dialysis due to the continuing shift by our customers from reusable to single-use dialyzers, which is having an adverse impact on our business and is expected to continue, as further described in Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this MD&A. In performing a detailed quantitative review for goodwill impairment, management uses a two-step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the related operating segments by using weighted fair value results of the discounted cash flow methodology, as well as the market multiple and comparable transaction methodologies, where applicable. The first step is a review for potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of impairment, if any.\nWe perform our annual impairment review for indefinite lived intangibles by first assessing qualitative factors, such as those described above, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of such assets is less than the carrying values, and if necessary, we perform a quantitative analysis comparing the current fair value of our indefinite lived intangibles assets to their carrying values. At July 31, 2016, because we determined through qualitative factors that the fair values of all of our indefinite lived intangible assets were unlikely to be less than the carrying value, we did not perform a quantitative analysis for those assets. With respect to amortizable intangible assets when impairment indicators are present, management would determine whether expected future non-discounted cash flows would be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets; if not, the carrying value of the assets would be adjusted to their fair value.\nManagement concluded that none of our intangible assets or goodwill was impaired as of July 31, 2016.\nWhile the results of these annual reviews have historically not indicated impairment, impairment reviews are highly dependent on management's projections of our future operating results and cash flows (which management believes to be reasonable), discount rates based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital and appropriate benchmark peer companies. Assumptions used in determining future operating results and cash flows include current and expected market conditions and future sales and earnings forecasts. Subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could result in future impairment. Although we consistently use the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations, such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. At July 31, 2016, the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded book value by substantial amounts. However, we believe the most significant assumptions impacting the impairment assessment of Dialysis relate to the assumed rate in which annual sales will decline as well as the expected future operating efficiencies included in our projections of future operating results and cash flows of this segment. If future operating results and cash flows are substantially less than our projections, future impairment charges may be recorded.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets including property, equipment and other assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An assessment is made to determine if the sum of the expected future non-discounted cash flows from the use of the assets and eventual disposition is less than the carrying value. If the sum of the expected non-discounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized based on fair value. With the exception of the impairment on an acquired license as further described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our historical assessments of our long-lived assets have not differed significantly from the actual amounts realized. However, the determination of fair value requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates and is highly subjective. On July 31, 2016, management concluded that no other events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the carrying amount of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable.\nWarranties\nWe provide for estimated costs that may be incurred to remedy deficiencies of quality or performance of our products at the time of revenue recognition. Most of our products have a one year warranty, although certain endoscopy and water purification and filtration products that require installation may carry a warranty period of up to twenty-four months. Additionally, many of our consumables, accessories and parts have a 90 day warranty. We record provisions for product warranties as a component of cost of sales based upon an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on products sold. The historical relationship of warranty costs to products sold is the primary basis for the estimate. A significant increase in third party service repair rates, the cost and availability of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize. Management reviews its warranty exposure periodically and believes that the warranty reserves are adequate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from original estimates, requiring adjustments to the reserves.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock compensation expense is recognized for any option or stock award grant based upon the award's fair value. All of our stock options and stock awards (which consist only of restricted stock) are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period, as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period. We recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight-line basis, reduced by estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.\nThe stock-based compensation expense recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements may not be representative of the effect of stock-based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years (which level may not be similar in the future), modifications to existing awards, accelerated vesting related to certain employment terminations and assumptions used in determining fair value, expected lives and estimated forfeitures. We determine the fair value of each stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The determination of fair value using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected option life (which is determined by using the historical closing prices of our common stock), the expected dividend yield (which is approximately 0.2%), and the expected option life (which is based on historical exercise behavior).\nIncome Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes is based on our current period income, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, statutory income tax rates, changes in uncertain tax benefits and the deductibility of expenses or availability of tax credits in various taxing jurisdictions. Tax laws are complex, subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing authorities and are subject to future modification, expiration or repeal\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nby government legislative bodies. We use significant judgment on a quarterly basis in determining our annual effective income tax rate and evaluating our tax positions.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities also include items recorded in conjunction with the purchase accounting for business acquisitions as well as net operating loss carryforwards. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets, as adjusted for valuation allowances, will be realized. Additionally, deferred tax liabilities are regularly reviewed to confirm that such amounts are appropriately stated. A review of our deferred tax items considers known future changes in various income tax rates, principally in the United States. If income tax rates were to change in the future, particularly in the United States and to a lesser extent Canada, the United Kingdom and Italy, our items of deferred tax could be materially affected. All of such evaluations require significant management judgments.\nWe record liabilities for an unrecognized tax benefit when a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, but is not recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements because it does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold that the uncertain tax position would be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. Any adjustments upon resolution of income tax uncertainties are recognized in our results of operations. Unrecognized tax benefits are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the related liability. Historically, we have not had significant unrecognized tax benefits.\nBusiness Combinations\nAcquisitions require significant estimates and judgments related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We determine fair value based on the estimated price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Such initial fair value amounts as well as other acquired assets and liabilities, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, are sometimes refined requiring subsequent adjustments.\nCertain liabilities and reserves are subjective in nature. We reflect such liabilities and reserves based upon the most recent information available. In conjunction with our acquisitions, such subjective liabilities and reserves principally include contingent consideration, certain deferred income tax liabilities, income tax and sales and use tax exposures, including tax liabilities related to our foreign subsidiaries, as well as reserves for accounts receivable, inventories, warranties and contingent obligations. We account for contingent consideration relating to business combinations as a liability and an increase to goodwill at the date of the acquisition and continually re-measure the liability at each balance sheet date by recording changes in the fair value through our Consolidated Statements of Income. We determine the fair value of contingent consideration based on future operating projections under various potential scenarios and weight the probability of these outcomes. Similarly, other acquisition related liabilities can be required to be recorded at fair value at the date of the acquisition and continually re-measured at each balance sheet date, such as the assumed contingent obligation relating to the Jet Prep Acquisition and the contingent guaranteed obligation relating to the PuriCore Acquisition, as further described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The ultimate settlement of liabilities relating to business combinations may be for amounts which are materially different from the amounts initially recorded and may cause volatility in our results of operations.\nOther Matters\nWe do not have any off balance sheet financial arrangements, other than future commitments under operating leases and executive severance and license agreements.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of July 31, 2016.", "item_7_truncated": "Net sales of healthcare disposables products increased by $5,111,000, or 5.0%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 principally due to increases in customer demand in the United States for our face masks, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA)-based high-level disinfectant and sterility assurance products as well as the inclusion of net sales generated by the DentaPure Acquisition, which was completed on February 20, 2015. Excluding net sales relating to the DentaPure Acquisition, organic net sales in our Healthcare Disposables segment increased by 3.7% for fiscal 2015.\n \u00b7 higher sales and improved profitability in our Dialysis segment primarily due to an increase in demand for our lower margin concentrate product, \nWe evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets including property, equipment and other assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An assessment is made to determine if the sum of the expected future non-discounted cash flows from the use of the assets and eventual disposition is less than the carrying value. If the sum of the expected non-discounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized based on fair value. With the exception of the impairment on an acquired license as further described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our historical assessments of our long-lived assets have not differed significantly from the actual amounts realized. However, the determination of fair value requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates and is highly subjective. On July 31, 2016, management concluded that no other events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the carrying amount of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable.\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

At July 31, 2016, because we determined through qualitative factors that the fair values of all of our indefinite lived intangible assets were unlikely to be less than the carrying value, we did not perform a quantitative analysis for those assets. With respect to amortizable intangible assets when impairment indicators are present, management would determine whether expected future non-discounted cash flows would be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets; if not, the carrying value of the assets would be adjusted to their fair value.\nForeign Currency Market Risk\nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 13.8% in fiscal 2015 compared with 13.3% in fiscal 2014.\nThe Water Purification and Filtration segment's operating income increased by $14,000, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of higher sales, partially offset by increases in annual salaries, the hiring of additional sales personnel, increased travel budgets and higher charges for warranty related to our water purification equipment.\n\t\t\t\n \u00b7 our strategic decision to invest in various growth initiatives designed to expand into new markets and gain or maintain market share in our three largest segments, \nThe reconciliations of net income to non-GAAP net income were calculated as follows:\n\t\t\n \u00b7 Net sales increased by 17.7% to $664,755,000 from $565,004,000; organic sales (i.e. excluding acquisitions, a divestiture and foreign currency translation) increased by 12.7%. \nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 14.7% in fiscal 2016 compared with 13.8% in fiscal 2015.\nEndoscopy Segment\nDialysis Segment\n\t\t\t\n (1) The summation of each diluted EPS does not equal the adjusted diluted EPS due to rounding. \nThe following table shows significant components of our cash flows for fiscals 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n \u00b7 an increase in interest expense due to the funding of acquisitions. \nOverall, fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange had an insignificant impact upon our net income in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015.\nand IMS for the portion of fiscal 2015 subsequent to their acquisition dates, (ii) the inclusion of general and administrative expenses of Jet Prep, Sterilator and PuriCore for the portion of fiscal 2014 subsequent to their fiscal 2014 acquisition dates compared with twelve months of such expenses in fiscal 2015, (iii) an increase of $2,624,000 in intangible amortization as a result of acquisitions, (iv) an increase of $1,308,000 in acquisition related charges primarily in our Endoscopy segment, (v) a $1,287,000 asset impairment charge in fiscal 2015 relating to an acquired license in our Endoscopy segment, and (vi) increases in annual salaries and incentive compensation including stock-based compensation. These items were partially offset by a favorable net change of $2,804,000 in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 for fair value adjustments of contingent liabilities primarily associated with the Jet Prep Acquisition in our Endoscopy segment, as further described elsewhere in this MD&A and in Notes 3 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as fiscal 2014 costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Financial Officer. Excluding (i) current and prior year amortization expense, (ii) current and prior year significant acquisition related items such as transaction and integration charges and fair value adjustments, (iii) the current year impairment of an acquired license, and (iv) prior year costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Financial Officer, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, general and administrative expenses increased by $11,087,000, or 21.1%, to $63,747,000 in fiscal 2015 from $52,660,000 in fiscal 2014.\nWarranties\nWe define net debt as long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents. Each of the components of net debt appears in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe that the presentation of net debt provides useful information to investors because we review net debt as part of our management of our overall liquidity, financial flexibility, capital structure and leverage.\n \u00b7 Dialysis: Medical device reprocessing systems, sterilants/disinfectants, dialysate concentrates and other supplies for renal dialysis. \nExcluding (i) current and prior year amortization expense, (ii) current and prior year acquisition related items such as transaction and integration charges and fair value adjustments, (iii) current year costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Executive Officer and (iv) the prior year impairment of an acquired license, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, general and administrative expenses increased by $14,880,000, or 23.3%, to $78,627,000 in fiscal 2016. Approximately a third of these increases are attributable to the inclusion of general and administrative expenses of our acquisitions.\nThe Water Purification and Filtration segment's operating income increased by $4,856,000, or 18.9%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of higher sales and improved gross profit percentage, as further explained above, partially offset by increases in annual salaries and the hiring of additional sales personnel.\nIn fiscal 2016, we announced the retirement plans of our Chief Executive Officer and recorded the majority of the costs associated with his retirement in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Since these costs are atypical and masks our underlying operating performance, we made an adjustment to our net income and EPS for fiscal 2016 to exclude such costs to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n\t\t\nWe define organic sales as net sales, calculated according to United States GAAP, less (i) the impact of foreign currency translation and (ii) net sales related to acquired businesses during the first twelve months of ownership and divestures during the periods being compared. We believe that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior periods. We exclude the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size, and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and can obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of financial performance difficult. The reconciliation of net sales to organic sales can be found elsewhere in this MD&A in Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015.\u201d\n (3) Amounts are recorded in income taxes. \n \u00b7 significantly higher sales and profitability in our Endoscopy segment principally due to (i) increases in demand for endoscope reprocessing equipment, higher margin products such as disposable infection control products used in GI endoscopy procedures, and endoscope reprocessing disinfectants and service as a result of the increased field population of equipment and (ii) the inclusion of sales of recent acquisitions, \n\t\t\nOther Matters\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $60,688,000, or 116.1%, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 primarily due to an increase in cash consideration paid for acquisitions.\n\nThe operating income of our Specialty Packaging business, which was reported in the Other reporting segment and divested on April 7, 2015, as further described elsewhere in this MD&A and in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, increased by $303,000 for the portion of fiscal 2015 prior to its divestiture compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in demand for our specialty packaging products resulting from the Ebola virus as well as recording foreign exchange gains associated with translating certain United States dollar denominated assets into our subsidiary's functional currency, the Canadian dollar.\nThe Endoscopy segment's operating income increased by $6,669,000, or 19.5%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to increases in demand in the United States and internationally for our endoscopy products and services, as further explained above, and a favorable net change of $2,804,000 in general and administrative expenses relating to fair value contingent liabilities adjustments that were favorable in fiscal 2015 compared to moderately unfavorable in fiscal 2014, as further described Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These items were partially offset by (i) increased investment in our sales team and other selling initiatives, (ii) lower selling prices of certain endoscopy products, (iii) an increase in acquisition related charges, (iv) increased research and development expenses due to additional product development initiatives, (v) increased intangible amortization as a result of acquisitions, (vi) a $1,287,000 asset impairment charge in fiscal 2015 relating to an acquired license, and (vii) increases in annual salaries and incentive compensation. Excluding the fair value adjustments, acquisition related charges and the asset impairment stated above and further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, the Endoscopy segment's operating income increased by $7,922,000, or 22.5% in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014.\nIn fiscal 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $29,942,000, compared with $6,105,000 used in financing activities in fiscal 2015. The fiscal 2016 net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the MI and NAMSA Acquisitions, partially offset by repayments under our credit facility.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we continually evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\t\t\nNet Sales\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nOn July 31, 2016, we had $116,000,000 of outstanding borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement. Subsequent to July 31, 2016, we borrowed $61,000,000 to fund the purchase price and transaction costs of the Accutron and Vantage acquisitions and repaid $6,000,000 resulting in total outstanding borrowings of $171,000,000 at September 29, 2016, none of which is required to be repaid until March 2019.\nThe Dialysis segment's operating income increased by $1,158,000, or 17.2% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to (i) an increase in sales for our low margin concentrate product to a single customer and (ii) successful cost control initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our higher margin sterilant products and RENATRON\u00ae reprocessing equipment.\nAccounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities. Allowances for doubtful accounts are reserves for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments. We use historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate. While actual losses have historically been within management's expectations and provisions established, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Alternatively, if certain customers paid their delinquent receivables, reductions in allowances may be required.\nThe increase in both domestic and international organic net sales for fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to increases in net sales of our endoscopy products and services due to increases in demand for (i) endoscope reprocessing equipment, (ii) higher margin products such as disposable infection control products used in GI endoscopy procedures, and (iii) endoscope reprocessing disinfectants and service as a result of the increased field population of equipment, as further described below in Endoscopy Segment.\u201d\nStock-Based Compensation\nInventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished products which are sold in the ordinary course of our business and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. In assessing the value of inventories, we must make estimates and judgments regarding reserves required for product obsolescence, aging of inventories and other issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products. In performing such evaluations, we use historical experience as well as current market information. With few exceptions, the saleable value of our inventories has historically been within management's expectation and provisions established, however, rapid changes in the market due to competition, technology and various other factors could have an adverse effect on the saleable value of our inventories, resulting in the need for additional reserves.\nWe have previously entered into various severance contracts with executives of the Company, including our corporate executive officers and certain of our subsidiary Chief Executive Officers, which define certain compensation arrangements relating to various employment termination scenarios, and multi-year employment agreements with certain executive officers of businesses we have acquired. Additionally, in March 2016 we entered into a succession plan agreement due to the planned retirement of our Chief Executive Officer who was succeeded on July 31, 2016, but remains employed as a Senior Advisor until October 15, 2016. This succession plan agreement requires future payments to our former Chief Executive Officer beginning in fiscal 2017 for transition-related services. The majority of those future payments are being recorded in general and administrative expenses from March 17, 2016 through his October 15, 2016 retirement date.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nOther Long-Term Obligation\nCertain liabilities and reserves are subjective in nature. We reflect such liabilities and reserves based upon the most recent information available. In conjunction with our acquisitions, such subjective liabilities and reserves principally include contingent consideration, certain deferred income tax liabilities, income tax and sales and use tax exposures, including tax liabilities related to our foreign subsidiaries, as well as reserves for accounts receivable, inventories, warranties and contingent obligations. We account for contingent consideration relating to business combinations as a liability and an increase to goodwill at the date of the acquisition and continually re-measure the liability at each balance sheet date by recording changes in the fair value through our Consolidated Statements of Income. We determine the fair value of contingent consideration based on future operating projections under various potential scenarios and weight the probability of these outcomes. Similarly, other acquisition related liabilities can be required to be recorded at fair value at the date of the acquisition and continually re-measured at each balance sheet date, such as the assumed contingent obligation relating to the Jet Prep Acquisition and the contingent guaranteed obligation relating to the PuriCore Acquisition, as further described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The ultimate settlement of liabilities relating to business combinations may be for amounts which are materially different from the amounts initially recorded and may cause volatility in our results of operations.\nInterest income increased by $5,000 to $68,000 in fiscal 2015 from $63,000 in fiscal 2014.\nMost of our equipment, consumables and supplies are used to help prevent the occurrence or spread of infections.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help you understand Cantel Medical Corp. ( Cantel\u201d). The MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Our MD&A includes the following sections:\n\t\t\t\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $4,862,000, or 10.3%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in cash consideration paid for acquisitions.\nInterest expense increased by $976,000 to $3,408,000 in fiscal 2016 from $2,432,000 in fiscal 2015, as a result of an increase in the average outstanding borrowings due to the funding of the MI and NAMSA Acquisitions in September 2015 and March 2016, respectively.\nFuture declaration of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of the Company's Board of Directors.\nWe first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount before proceeding to step one of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, if necessary. Such qualitative factors that are assessed include evaluating a segment's financial performance, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions and specific issues that can directly affect the segment such as changes in business strategies, competition, supplier relationships, operating costs, regulatory matters, litigation and the composition of the segment's assets due to acquisitions or other events. At July 31, 2016, because we determined through qualitative factors that the fair values of our Endoscopy, Water Purification and Filtration and Healthcare Disposables segments were unlikely to be less than the carrying value, we did not proceed to step one of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for those three segments. We performed step one of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for Dialysis due to the continuing shift by our customers from reusable to single-use dialyzers, which is having an adverse impact on our business and is expected to continue, as further described in Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this MD&A. In performing a detailed quantitative review for goodwill impairment, management uses a two-step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the related operating segments by using weighted fair value results of the discounted cash flow methodology, as well as the market multiple and comparable transaction methodologies, where applicable. The first step is a review for potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of impairment, if any.\nA portion of our endoscopy, water purification and filtration and dialysis sales are recognized as multiple element arrangements, whereby revenue is allocated to the equipment, installation and consumable components based upon vendor specific objective evidence, which includes comparable historical transactions of similar equipment, installation and consumables sold as stand-alone components. If vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price is not available, we allocate revenue to the elements of the bundled arrangement using the estimated selling price method in order to qualify the components as separate units of accounting. Revenue on the equipment and consumables components are recognized as the equipment or consumable is shipped to customers and title passes. Revenue on the installation component is recognized when the installation is complete.\nIn fiscal 2015, we conducted a strategic review of our Specialty Packaging business and evaluated its potential value in the marketplace relative to the business's historic and expected returns and concluded that the business was not part of our core strategy and could return a higher value to stockholders by its divestiture. Accordingly, our Specialty Packaging business (reported in the Other reporting segment) was classified as held-for-sale within our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet beginning October 31, 2014. Since the operating results of the Specialty Packaging segment, as shown in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, were not significant in relation to our overall consolidated operating results, the lack of operating results from this business due to its divestiture did not have a major effect on our operations and financial results, and accordingly, has not been classified as a discontinued operation for any of the periods presented.\nincome for us from these low risk cash equivalents, which would partially offset the adverse impact of the additional interest expense. Our other long-term liabilities would not be materially affected by an increase in interest rates.\nCantel is a leading provider of infection prevention products and services in the healthcare market, specializing in the following operating segments:\n (iv) In our prior fiscal year, we acquired (i) all of the issued and outstanding stock of MRLB International, Inc. ( MRLB\u201d) on February 20, 2015 (the DentaPure Acquisition\u201d), (ii) certain net assets of Pure Water Solutions, Inc. ( PWS\u201d) on January 1, 2015 (the PWS Acquisition\u201d) and (iii) all of the issued and outstanding stock of International Medical Service S.r.l. ( IMS\u201d) on November 3, 2014 (the IMS Acquisition\u201d), as more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, the results of operations of MRLB, PWS and IMS are included in our consolidated results of operations in fiscal 2016 and the portions of fiscal 2015 subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Their results of operations are not included in our results in fiscal 2014. The businesses of MRLB (the DentaPure Business\u201d), PWS (the PWS Business\u201d) and IMS (the IMS Business\u201d) did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations due to the size of the businesses in relation to our overall consolidated results of operations. The DentaPure Business is included in our Healthcare Disposables segment, the PWS Business is included in our Water Purification and Filtration segment and the IMS Business is included in our Endoscopy segment. Subsequent to the IMS Acquisition, we changed the name of International Medical Service S.r.l. to Cantel Medical (Italy) S.r.l. \n \u00b7 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 46.5% from 44.9%. \nRevenue on product sales is recognized as products are shipped to customers and title passes. The passing of title is determined based upon the FOB terms specified for each shipment. With respect to endoscopy and dialysis products, shipment terms are generally FOB origin for common carrier and when our distribution fleet is utilized (except for one large customer in dialysis and several endoscopy customers whereby all products are shipped FOB destination). With respect to water purification and filtration and healthcare disposable products, shipment terms may be either FOB origin or destination. Customer acceptance for the majority of our product sales occurs at the time of delivery. With respect to a portion of water purification and filtration and endoscopy product sales, equipment is sold as part of a system for which the equipment is functionally interdependent or the customer's purchase order specifies ship-complete\u201d as a condition of delivery; revenue recognition on such sales is deferred until all equipment has been delivered, or post-delivery obligations such as installation have been substantially fulfilled such that the products are deemed functional by the end-user. All shipping and handling fees invoiced to customers, such as freight, are recorded as revenue (and related costs are included within cost of sales) at the time the sale is recognized.\n (2) In fiscal 2016, acquisition related items of $959 and $2,254 were recorded in cost of sales and general administrative expenses, respectively. In fiscal 2015, acquisition related items of $1,981 and ($402) were recorded in cost of sales and general administrative expenses, respectively. In fiscal 2014, all acquisition related items were recorded in general and administrative expenses. \nGross Profit\nIn fiscal 2015, net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to repayments under our credit facility, partially offset by borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the acquisitions of IMS, PWS and DentaPure acquisitions.\nSignificant Activity\nManagement concluded that none of our intangible assets or goodwill was impaired as of July 31, 2016.\nNet Sales\n\t\t\n (1) Primarily to fund the cash consideration paid and the costs associated with the Accutron and Vantage Acquisitions, we borrowed $55,000,000 in August 2016 and $6,000,000 in September 2016, respectively, under our revolving credit facility, and repaid $6,000,000, therefore increasing the 2019 maturities of the credit facility from $116,000,000 at July 31, 2016 to $171,000,000 at September 29, 2016. Accordingly, the expected interest payments under the credit facility will be approximately $1,232,000 higher on an annualized basis as of September 29, 2016 than the amounts shown herein. The expected interest payments under our credit facility reflect an interest rate of 2.24%, which was our weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings at July 31, 2016. \nOn April 7, 2015, we completed the sale of our Specialty Packaging business to a global packaging and service company by selling all the issued and outstanding stock of our Specialty Packaging subsidiary in exchange for $7,531,000 in cash proceeds, of which $660,000 is held in escrow for indemnity obligations, if any, until October 7, 2016 and is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, we\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\t\t\nInventories\nAlthough overall inflation did not have a significant effect on our business, an increase in commodity prices can adversely affect our gross margins. Specifically, our businesses can be adversely impacted by rising fuel and oil prices and are heavily reliant on certain raw materials, such as chemicals, paper, resin, stainless steel and plastic components. From time to time, we experience price increases for raw materials. If we are unable to implement price increases to our customers, our gross margins could be adversely affected.\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\nInflation\n\n\t\t\nOur operating segments generate significant cash from operations. At July 31, 2016, we had a cash balance of $28,367,000, of which $9,804,000 was held by foreign subsidiaries. Our foreign cash is needed by our foreign subsidiaries for working capital purposes as well as for current international growth initiatives. Accordingly, our foreign unremitted earnings are considered permanently reinvested and unavailable for repatriation.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nAmortization expense is a non-cash expense related to intangibles that were primarily the result of business acquisitions. Our history of acquiring businesses has resulted in significant increases in amortization of intangible assets that reduced the Company's net income. The removal of amortization from our overall operating performance helps in assessing our cash generated from operations including our return on invested capital, which we believe is an important analysis for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our continued growth.\nCritical Accounting Policies provides a discussion of our accounting policies that require critical judgments, assumptions and estimates.\nThe higher gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2016 and 2015 was primarily attributable to (i) more favorable sales mix due to increases in sales volume of certain products that carry higher gross margin percentages such as our procedure room products and disinfectants in our Endoscopy segment, sterility assurance and waterline disinfection products in our Healthcare Disposables segment and sterilants and filters in our Water Purification and Filtration segment, (ii) the inclusion of higher margin sales in our Endoscopy and Healthcare Disposables segments as a result of the MI and NAMSA Acquisitions, respectively, (iii) lower manufacturing costs and (iv) decrease of $2,334,000 in medical device excise tax due to the recent moratorium, as further explained below, partially offset by an increase in net sales of lower margin capital equipment primarily in our Endoscopy segment and higher charges for warranty primarily relating to our water purification equipment.\nThe reconciliations of debt to net debt were calculated as follows:\nOn March 4, 2014, we entered into a $250,000,000 Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2014 Credit Agreement\u201d). The 2014 Credit Agreement includes a five-year $250,000,000 senior secured revolving facility with sublimits of up to $100,000,000 for borrowings in foreign currencies, $30,000,000 for letters of credit and $10,000,000 for swing line loans (the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent including the consent of the lenders, the Company may from time to time increase the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed $100,000,000. The senior lenders include Bank of America N.A. (the lead bank and administrative agent), PNC Bank, National Association, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The 2014 Credit Agreement expires on March 4, 2019. Additionally, subject to certain restrictions and conditions (i) any of our domestic or foreign subsidiaries may become borrowers and (ii) borrowings may occur in multi-currencies.\nFor fiscal 2016, we made adjustments to net income and diluted EPS to exclude (i) amortization expense, (ii) significant acquisition related items impacting current operating performance including transaction and integration charges and ongoing fair value adjustments, (iii) costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Executive Officer and (iv) the impact of favorable tax legislation to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS.\n \u00b7 Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense ( Adjusted EBITDAS\u201d) increased by 21.2% to $137,949,000 from $113,811,000, as further described and reconciled to net income in Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in this MD&A. \nIn September 2013, we acquired a license from a third party granting us the exclusive right to manufacture, commercialize, distribute and sell an endoscopy product in its beginning stage of commercialization in exchange for a series of payments, which totaled $1,000,000 by our second quarter of fiscal 2015 and was recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We evaluated this long-lived asset in fiscal 2015 for potential impairment and determined that the future use of this acquired license was unlikely based on a recent product analysis. Accordingly, we deemed the acquired license, together with related fixed assets of $287,000 to be fully impaired and recorded a loss of $1,287,000 during fiscal 2015, which was recorded in general and administrative expenses and as reductions in other assets and property and equipment in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Since the acquisition of the license and subsequent impairment were outside our standard endoscopy business operations, we excluded the impairment of the acquired license for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to past operating performance.\nincurred approximately $1,128,000 in costs associated with the disposition of this business including bonuses associated with the sale, accelerated stock-based compensation and to a lesser extent certain advisory fees. Furthermore as a result of this disposition, we recognized a foreign currency translation gain of $1,264,000 in our Consolidated Statement of Income, which was recorded in stockholders' equity immediately preceding the disposition. Such foreign currency translation gain was a result of the monthly translation of the Specialty Packaging segment's balance sheets beginning in 2004, when the business was acquired. In addition, due to the inability to currently deduct a capital loss and the uncertainty of utilizing a capital loss tax benefit in the future, a tax benefit was not recognized on a portion of the recorded loss on sale of the business. Overall, this transaction, including costs associated with the disposition and the recognition of a foreign currency translation gain, resulted in a $2,206,000 loss, or $0.04 in diluted earnings per share, which was recorded in loss on sale of business in our Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2015. Such amount is subject to further adjustments for indemnity obligations, if any.\nWe continue to benefit from having a broad portfolio of infection prevention products and services sold into diverse business segments, where approximately 73% of our net sales are attributable to consumable products and service. The primary factors that contributed to this financial performance, as further described elsewhere in this MD&A, were as follows:\n\t\t\t\nWe record liabilities for an unrecognized tax benefit when a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, but is not recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements because it does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold that the uncertain tax position would be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. Any adjustments upon resolution of income tax uncertainties are recognized in our results of operations. Unrecognized tax benefits are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the related liability. Historically, we have not had significant unrecognized tax benefits.\nWe provide for estimated costs that may be incurred to remedy deficiencies of quality or performance of our products at the time of revenue recognition. Most of our products have a one year warranty, although certain endoscopy and water purification and filtration products that require installation may carry a warranty period of up to twenty-four months. Additionally, many of our consumables, accessories and parts have a 90 day warranty. We record provisions for product warranties as a component of cost of sales based upon an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on products sold. The historical relationship of warranty costs to products sold is the primary basis for the estimate. A significant increase in third party service repair rates, the cost and availability of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize. Management reviews its warranty exposure periodically and believes that the warranty reserves are adequate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from original estimates, requiring adjustments to the reserves.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nOperating Leases\nOur provision for income taxes is based on our current period income, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, statutory income tax rates, changes in uncertain tax benefits and the deductibility of expenses or availability of tax credits in various taxing jurisdictions. Tax laws are complex, subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing authorities and are subject to future modification, expiration or repeal\nIncome Taxes\nFinancing Needs\nResearch and development expense as a percentage of net sales were 2.3% and 2.5% in fiscals 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n (iii) In our current fiscal year, we acquired (i) all of the issued and outstanding stock of Medical Innovations Group Holdings Limited and certain affiliated companies (collectively, MI\u201d) on September 14, 2015 (the MI Acquisition\u201d) and (ii) certain net assets of North American Science Associates, Inc.'s Sterility Assurance Monitoring Products division ( NAMSA\u201d) on March 1, 2016 (the NAMSA Acquisition\u201d), as more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, the results of operations of MI and NAMSA are included in our consolidated results of operations for the portions of fiscal 2016 subsequent to their acquisition dates. The businesses of MI (the MI Business\u201d) and NAMSA (the NAMSA Business\u201d) are not included in our results of operations in fiscals 2015 and 2014. However, with the exception of acquisition related costs as more fully described in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below, their results of operations did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations in fiscal 2016 due to the size of the businesses in relation to our overall consolidated results of operations. The MI Business is included in our Endoscopy segment and NAMSA Business is included in the Healthcare Disposables segment. Subsequent to the MI Acquisition, we changed the name of Medical Innovations Group Holdings Limited to Cantel (UK) Limited. \nWorking Capital\nIn relation to the Jet Prep Acquisition, we have recorded at July 31, 2016 a $1,138,000 liability for the estimated fair value of an assumed contingent obligation payable to the Israeli Government, as further described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which will be payable based on future sales of the Jet Prep Business. Additionally, in connection with the PuriCore Acquisition, we assumed a contingent guaranteed obligation to reimburse an endoscope service company for endoscope repair costs it incurs when servicing its customers' endoscopes that are damaged by one of PuriCore's discontinued endoscope reprocessing machine models, as further described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As such, the estimates of the annual required payments as well as the fair value of these contingent liabilities are subjective in nature and highly dependent on future sales projections. Additionally, since we will be continually re-measuring these liabilities at each balance sheet date and recording changes in the respective fair values through our Consolidated Statements of Income, we may potentially have earnings volatility in our future results of operations until the assumed contingent obligation and contingent guaranteed obligation are satisfied, or until the sales of the Jet Prep products no longer exist.\nOur endoscopy products and services are sold directly to hospitals and other end-users in the United States and primarily to distributors internationally except for the United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Singapore, China and Germany where we sell directly to hospitals and other end-users; water purification and filtration products and services are sold directly to hospitals, dialysis clinics, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, laboratories, medical products and service companies and other end-users as well as through third-party distributors; the majority of our healthcare disposable products are sold to third party distributors and with respect to some of our sterility assurance products, to hospitals, surgery centers, physician and dental offices, dental schools, medical research companies, laboratories and other end-users; and the majority of our dialysis products are sold to dialysis clinics and hospitals. Sales to all of these customers follow our revenue recognition policies.\nInternational net sales increased by $32,299,000, or 38.1%, to $117,156,000 in fiscal 2015 from $84,857,000 in fiscal 2014. The increase in international net sales was primarily due to increases in net sales of endoscopy products and services in the United Kingdom and Italy as a result of the acquisitions of PuriCore and IMS. A significant portion of the net sales of the acquired United Kingdom business relates to product service, and therefore the acquisition was a significant reason for our worldwide product service net sales to increase by $17,130,000, or 31.6%, to $71,348,000 in fiscal 2015 from $54,218,000 in fiscal 2014.\n\t\t\t\n \u00b7 a lower effective tax rate due to the recording of certain atypical tax items, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A. \nWe use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency transactions. Market risk is defined here as the potential change in fair value resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. Overall for fiscals 2016 and 2015, a uniform 15% adverse movement in foreign currency rates would have resulted in realized losses (after tax) of approximately $1,680,000 and $1,371,000, respectively. Conversely, for fiscals 2016 and 2015, a uniform 15% favorable movement in foreign currency rates would have resulted in realized gains (after tax) of approximately $1,680,000 and $1,371,000, respectively.\n\t\t\nAs of July 31, 2016, aggregate annual required payments over the next five years and thereafter under our contractual obligations that have long-term components are as follows:\n\t\t\t\nLoss on Sale of Business\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $5,202,000, or 8.1%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to planned strategic increases in stock levels of certain products maintained in inventory primarily in our Endoscopy segment and the repayment of liabilities acquired in conjunction with the IMS Acquisition, partially offset by the increase in net income (after adjusting for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, loss on sale of business, impairment of assets, fair value adjustments of acquisition related liabilities and deferred income taxes).\n (3) These future potential payments of an assumed contingent liability relate to the Jet Prep Acquisition, as further explained below, and are reflected in the July 31, 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet at its net present value of $1,138,000 using a discount rate of 2.5%. \nNet sales of endoscopy products and services increased by $58,214,000, or 30.6%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014, primarily due to increases in demand in the United States and internationally for our (i) disinfectants, service, equipment accessories and filters due to the increase in the installed base of endoscope reprocessing equipment, (ii) procedure room products (disposable infection control products used in GI endoscopy procedures) and (iii) endoscope reprocessing equipment. Additionally, the increase in fiscal 2015 was attributable to the inclusion of net sales generated in the United Kingdom and Italy as a result of acquiring PuriCore on June 30, 2014 and IMS on November 3, 2014. Excluding the incremental net sales provided by these acquisitions, organic net sales in our Endoscopy segment increased by 15.5% for fiscal 2015. These increases were partially offset by overall lower selling prices in most endoscopy product offerings totaling approximately $4,100,000 as a result of strategic growth programs and increased competition, as well as the adverse impact on international sales of a stronger dollar relative to the euro, which accounted for approximately a third of the lower selling prices.\nThe following table gives information as to the net sales by reporting segment and geography (which represents the geographic area from which the Company derives its net sales from external customers), as well as the related percentage of such sales to the total net sales.\nFiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015\nIn evaluating our operating performance, we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) with certain internally driven non-GAAP financial measures, namely (i) non-GAAP net income, (ii) non-GAAP diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d), (iii) income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense ( EBITDAS\u201d), (iv) EBITDAS adjusted for atypical items ( Adjusted EBITDAS\u201d), (v) net debt and (vi) organic sales. These non-GAAP financial measures are indicators of the Company's performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. They are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to financial information used by us in our financial analysis and operational decision-making. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors, shareholders and other readers of our Consolidated Financial Statements in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from, or as an alternative to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nEndoscopy Segment\n \u00b7 Non-GAAP diluted EPS increased by 21.5% to $1.75 from $1.44, as further described and reconciled to diluted EPS in Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in this MD&A. \n\t\t\n (ii) We sell our dialysis products to a concentrated number of customers. Sales in our Dialysis segment have been adversely impacted in recent years by the decrease in demand for our products that are used by dialysis centers that reuse dialyzers, such as our sterilant products and RENATRON\u00ae reprocessing equipment. With the exception of the current year that had increased sales of low margin concentrate products, which are products not used in dialyzer reprocessing, this reduction in dialysis sales has reduced overall profitability in this segment relative to prior years. Our market for Dialysis reprocessing products is limited to dialysis centers that reuse dialyzers, which market has been decreasing in the United States despite the environmental advantages and our belief that the per-procedure cost of reuse dialyzers is more economical than single-use dialyzers. Based on discussions with customers, we expect the downward trend in reuse dialyzers in the United States will continue during fiscal 2017 and thereafter. A substantial reduction of our dialysis reuse business will likely have a significant adverse effect on our Dialysis segment and reduce our margins and net income in that segment as well as result in potential future impairments of long-lived assets. Such reduction would also adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. See Risk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \n\n (4) These future potential payments of a contingent guaranteed obligation relate to Cantel Medical (UK), as further explained below. \nA portion of our healthcare disposables sales relating to the mail-in spore test kit is recorded as deferred revenue when initially sold. We recognize the revenue on these test kits using an estimate based on historical experience\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nFor fiscal 2015, we made adjustments to net income and diluted EPS to exclude (i) amortization expense, (ii) significant acquisition related items impacting current operating performance including transaction and integration charges and ongoing fair value adjustments, (iii) the loss on sale of our Specialty Packaging business and (iv) the impairment of an acquired license to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS.\nFor fiscal 2014, we made adjustments to net income and diluted EPS to exclude (i) amortization expense, (ii) significant acquisition related items impacting current operating performance primarily relating to transaction charges and ongoing fair value adjustments, and (iii) costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Financial Officer to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures.\nIn relation to the IMS Acquisition on November 3, 2014, we assumed an $843,000 liability to the central bank of Italy as part of funding provided by an Italian government agency, of which $187,000 and $656,000 were recorded in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. Such amount was a portion of the financial support obtained from the Italian government's Ministry of Education, Universities and Research to fund research and development activity relating to IMS's automated endoscope reprocessors. The liability is payable in semi-annual installments, bears interest at 0.25% per annum and has a maturity date of January 1, 2019. At July 31, 2016, $415,000 is outstanding, of which $165,000 is recorded in accrued expense and $250,000 is recorded in other long-term liabilities.\nWhile the results of these annual reviews have historically not indicated impairment, impairment reviews are highly dependent on management's projections of our future operating results and cash flows (which management believes to be reasonable), discount rates based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital and appropriate benchmark peer companies. Assumptions used in determining future operating results and cash flows include current and expected market conditions and future sales and earnings forecasts. Subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could result in future impairment. Although we consistently use the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations, such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. At July 31, 2016, the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded book value by substantial amounts. However, we believe the most significant assumptions impacting the impairment assessment of Dialysis relate to the assumed rate in which annual sales will decline as well as the expected future operating efficiencies included in our projections of future operating results and cash flows of this segment. If future operating results and cash flows are substantially less than our projections, future impairment charges may be recorded.\nGross profit increased by $40,168,000, or 18.8%, to $253,467,000 in fiscal 2015 from $213,299,000 in fiscal 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2015 and 2014 was 44.9% and 43.6%, respectively.\n\t\t\t\nLiquidity and Capital Resources provides an overview of our working capital, cash flows, contractual obligations, financing and foreign currency activities.\n \u00b7 the prior year loss on sale relating to the divestiture of our specialty packaging business, and \nDialysis Segment\n\t\t\nGeneral corporate expenses relate to unallocated corporate costs primarily related to executive management personnel as well as costs associated with certain facets of our acquisition program and being a publicly traded company. Such expenses increased by $8,304,000, or 44.9% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to (i) $3,487,000 of costs recorded in the second half of fiscal 2016 associated with the retirement of our Chief Executive\n\t\t\t\n (2) Amounts include $4,500,000, of which $3,823,000 is payable in fiscal 2017, due to the planned retirement of our former CEO. Effective August 1, 2016 in conjunction with the Accutron Acquisition, we entered into additional compensation agreements which would increase fiscal years 2017 and 2018 by $400,000 each compared to amounts shown herein. \n\nThe results of operations described below reflect the operating results of Cantel and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nInterest\nThe stock-based compensation expense recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements may not be representative of the effect of stock-based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years (which level may not be similar in the future), modifications to existing awards, accelerated vesting related to certain employment terminations and assumptions used in determining fair value, expected lives and estimated forfeitures. We determine the fair value of each stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The determination of fair value using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected option life (which is determined by using the historical closing prices of our common stock), the expected dividend yield (which is approximately 0.2%), and the expected option life (which is based on historical exercise behavior).\nFiscal 2015 compared with Fiscal 2014\nThese unfavorable items were offset by the impact of recording acquisition related items consisting of net favorable acquisition related fair value adjustments recorded in general and administrative expenses relating to the Jet Prep Acquisition that were not tax effected due to the structure of the acquisition, partially offset by non-deductible acquisition related charges.\nNone of our sales contain right-of-return provisions. Customer claims for credit or return due to damage, defect, shortage or other reason must be pre-approved by us before credit is issued or such product is accepted for return. No cash discounts for early payment are offered except with respect to a small portion of our product sales in each segment. We do not offer price protection, although advance pricing contracts or required notice periods prior to implementation of price increases exist for certain customers with respect to many of our products. With respect to certain of our dialysis, healthcare disposables, water purification and filtration and endoscopy customers, rebates are provided; such rebates, which consist primarily of volume rebates, are provided for as a reduction of sales at the time of revenue recognition and amounted to $5,944,000, $5,597,000, and $4,498,000 in fiscals 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Such allowances are determined based on estimated projections of sales volume for the entire rebate periods. If it becomes known that sales volume to customers will deviate from original projections, the rebate provisions originally established would be adjusted accordingly.\nWith the exception of fiscal 2016 that had increased sales of low margin concentrate products, which is a product not used in dialyzer reprocessing, sales in our Dialysis segment in recent years have been adversely impacted by the decrease in demand for our sterilants and RENATRON\u00ae reprocessing equipment principally due to the shift from reusable to single-use dialyzers as a result of the declining cost of single-use dialyzers, the ease of using a dialyzer one time, and the commitment of Fresenius Medical Care, the largest dialysis provider chain in the United States and a manufacturer of single-use dialyzers, to convert dialysis clinics performing reuse to single-use facilities. In addition, DaVita, a customer who accounted for approximately 18.0% of net sales in this segment, has converted certain clinics from reuse to single-use and in many cases utilizes single-use when opening new clinics. Based on discussions with customers, we expect the downward trend in reuse dialyzers in the United States to continue during fiscal 2017 and thereafter. A substantial decrease in the market for reprocessing products is likely to result in a significant loss of net sales and a lower level of profitability and operating cash flow in this segment in the future as well as potential future impairments of long-lived assets. Such reduction would also adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. See Risk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nGross Profit\n (v) In December 2015, a law was enacted that included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax, which favorably impacts our gross profit, as more fully described elsewhere in this MD&A. \nWe believe EBITDAS is an important valuation measurement for management and investors given the increasing effect that non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, amortization related to acquisitions and depreciation of capital equipment, has on the Company's net income. In particular, acquisitions have historically resulted in significant increases in amortization of intangible assets that reduce the Company's net income. Additionally, we regard EBITDAS as a useful measure of operating performance and cash flow before the effect of interest expense and is a complement to operating income, net income and other GAAP financial performance measures.\nThe Healthcare Disposables segment's operating income increased by $4,582,000, or 23.0%, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to (i) the inclusion of sales relating to acquisitions, (ii) less amortization expense and (iii) lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by increases to annual salaries and the hiring of additional sales personnel. Excluding amortization expense, and to a much lesser extent acquisition related items, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, the Healthcare Disposables segment's operating income increased by $2,857,000, or 11.6% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015.\n\t\t\nThe Endoscopy segment's operating income increased by $20,158,000, or 49.3%, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to increases in sales in the United States and internationally for our endoscopy products and services, as further explained above, and to a much lesser extent, the inclusion of operating income from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by (i) higher commission expense and other incentive compensation, (ii) increased investment in our sales team and other selling initiatives, (iii) a net unfavorable impact from atypical items, as further described below and within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A and (iv) an increase in annual salaries. Excluding amortization expense as well as atypical items relating to current and prior year acquisition related items and a prior year license impairment, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, the Endoscopy segment's operating income increased by $21,746,000, or 44.4% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015.\n\t\t\t\nSelling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 14.3% in fiscal 2015 compared with 13.6% in fiscal 2014.\nFor fiscals 2016 and 2015, the realized losses (after tax) would have resulted primarily from (i) increases in the values of the Euro and Canadian dollar relative to the United States dollar and (ii) decreases in the values of the British Pound and Singapore dollar relative to the United States dollar due to the composition of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' financials. However, the use of foreign currency forward contracts would partially offset such realized losses.\nTotal net sales increased by $99,751,000 or 17.7%, to $664,755,000 in fiscal 2016 from $565,004,000 in fiscal 2015. The 17.7% increase in net sales for fiscal 2016 includes (i) an increase of 12.7% in organic sales, (ii) an increase of 5.5% in sales due to acquisitions, partially offset by the divestiture of our specialty packaging business, and (iii) a decrease of 0.5% in net sales due to foreign currency translation.\nSpecialty Packaging\nResearch and development expenses (which include continuing engineering costs) increased by $3,209,000, or 29.7%, to $14,022,000 in fiscal 2015 from $10,813,000 in fiscal 2014 primarily due to additional product development initiatives primarily in our Endoscopy segment, including the inclusion of projects relating to the acquired PuriCore and IMS businesses.\nIn order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the Euro, British Pound and Singapore dollar relative to the United States dollar on the conversion of such net assets into the functional currencies, we enter into short-term contracts to purchase Euros, British Pounds and Singapore dollars forward, which contracts are one-month in duration. These short-term contracts are designated as fair value hedge instruments. There were four foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate value of $7,039,000 at August 31, 2016, which covered certain assets and liabilities that were denominated in currencies other than each entity's functional currency. Such contracts expire on September 30, 2016. These foreign currency forward contracts are continually replaced with new one-month contracts as long as we have significant net assets that are denominated and ultimately settled in currencies other than each entity's functional currency. Gains and losses related to these hedging contracts to buy Euros, British Pounds and Singapore dollars forward are immediately realized within general and administrative expenses due to the short-term nature of such contracts. For fiscal 2016, such forward contracts partially offset the impact on operations related to certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than each entity's functional currency. We do not currently hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar and Chinese Renminbi relative to the United States dollar because the overall foreign currency exposures relating to those currencies are currently not deemed significant. Additionally, we do not hedge transactions associated with the funding of international acquisitions due to the short-term nature of the foreign currency exposure.\nIn addition, we had another operating segment that was divested on April 7, 2015, known as Specialty Packaging, which comprised the Other reporting segment for financial reporting purposes, as further described in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Since the operating results of the Specialty Packaging segment were not significant in relation to our overall consolidated operating results, the divestiture of the business did not have a major effect on our operations and financial results, and accordingly, has not been classified as a discontinued operation for any of the periods presented.\n \u00b7 After adjusting net income for amortization expense and atypical items, non-GAAP net income increased by 21.5% to $72,938,000 from $60,039,000, as further described and reconciled to net income in Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in this MD&A. \nWater Purification and Filtration Segment\nIncome Taxes\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nInterest\nItem 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nResearch and development expense as a percentage of net sales were 2.5% and 2.2% in fiscals 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nBorrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement bear interest at rates ranging from 0.25% to 1.25% above the lender's base rate, or at rates ranging from 1.25% to 2.25% above the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d), depending upon the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio,\u201d which is defined as the consolidated ratio of total funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and as further adjusted under the terms of the 2014 Credit Agreement ( Consolidated EBITDA\u201d). At September 29, 2016, the lender's base rate was 3.50% and the LIBOR rates ranged from 0.52% to 1.33%. The margins applicable to our outstanding borrowings were 0.50% above the lender's base rate or 1.50% above LIBOR. All of our outstanding borrowings were under LIBOR contracts at September 29, 2016. The 2014 Credit Agreement also provides for fees on the unused portion of our facility at rates ranging from 0.20% to 0.40%, depending upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio; such rate was 0.25% at September 29, 2016.\nGeneral Corporate Expenses\nLong-Lived Assets\nIn fiscal 2016, our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in the semi-annual cash dividend to $0.06 per share of outstanding common stock, which was paid on each of January 29, 2016 and July 29, 2016 and totaled $5,005,000.\nOfficer, (ii) the addition of internal and external resources to address various growth initiatives and compliance requirements, (iii) increases in costs associated with our acquisition program and (iv) increases in annual salaries and incentive compensation, including stock-based compensation expense.\n\t\t\t\nof the amount of time that elapses from the point of sale to when the kit is returned to us and we communicate to the customer the results of the required laboratory test. The related cost of the kits is recorded in inventory and recognized in cost of sales as the revenue is earned.\n\t\t\nA reconciliation of the consolidated effective income tax rate for fiscals 2015 and 2014 is as follows:\nThe following table gives information as to the amount of operating income, as well as operating income as a percentage of net sales, for each of our reporting segments.\n\t\t\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nSelling expenses increased by $14,268,000, or 21.5%, to $80,787,000 in fiscal 2015 from $66,519,000 in fiscal 2014 primarily due to (i) increased sales and marketing initiatives to expand into new markets, including international markets, and gain or maintain market share by hiring and training additional sales and marketing personnel and increasing travel budgets in our Endoscopy and Water Purification and Filtration segments and to a lesser extent, our Healthcare Disposables segment, (ii) the inclusion of selling and marketing expenses of DentaPure, PWS, IMS and PuriCore in fiscal 2015, (iii) higher commission expense principally in our Endoscopy segment as a result of higher sales and (iv) increases in annual salaries.\nThe above factors were partially offset by:\nHealthcare Disposables Segment\nby government legislative bodies. We use significant judgment on a quarterly basis in determining our annual effective income tax rate and evaluating our tax positions.\nNet sales of endoscopy products and services increased by $93,098,000, or 37.4%, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015. The 37.4% increase in net sales consist of (i) an increase of 28.0% in organic net sales, (ii) an increase of 10.2% in net sales due to acquisitions and (iii) decrease of 0.8% in net sales due to foreign currency translation. The increase in organic net sales was primarily due to increases in demand in the United States and internationally for our (i) procedure room products (disposable infection control products used in GI endoscopy procedures) due to sales and marketing efforts, (ii) endoscope reprocessing equipment due to our sales and marketing programs and (iii) disinfectants and service due to the increase in the installed base of endoscope reprocessing equipment. We expect sales of disinfectants, service, filters and equipment accessories, most of which carry higher margins, to continue to benefit as we increase the installed base of endoscope reprocessing equipment. These increases were partially offset by overall lower selling prices principally related to endoscopy reprocessing equipment and procedure room products as a result of our strategic growth plan and increased competition.\nOperating Expenses\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn fiscal 2015, our Board of Directors approved an 11.1% increase in the semi-annual cash dividend to $0.05 per share of outstanding common stock, which was paid on each of January 30, 2015 and July 31, 2015 and totaled $4,154,000.\nSelling expenses increased by $18,275,000, or 22.6%, to $99,062,000 in fiscal 2016 from $80,787,000 in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, selling expenses increased primarily due to (i) higher commission expense relating to increased net sales in our Endoscopy segment, (ii) increased sales and marketing initiatives to expand into new markets, including\nTotal net sales increased by $76,255,000, or 15.6%, to $565,004,000 in fiscal 2015 from $488,749,000 in fiscal 2014. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions and the business divestiture, total organic sales increased by $44,179,000, or 9.2%. The increase in organic net sales for fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to increases in net sales of our endoscopy and water purification and filtration products and services and healthcare disposables products, as further described below in Endoscopy Segment,\u201d Water Purification and Filtration Segment\u201d and Healthcare Disposables Segment.\u201d\nHealthcare Disposables Segment\nOverview provides a brief description of our business and a summary of significant activity that has affected or may affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRevenue Recognition\nCertain of our identifiable intangible assets, including customer relationships, technology, brand names, non-compete agreements and patents, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which range from 3 to 20 years. Additionally, we have recorded goodwill and trademarks and trade names, all of which have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not amortized. All of our intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, and goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Our management is responsible for determining if impairment exists and considers a number of factors, including third-party valuations, when making these determinations.\nInterest expense increased by $52,000 to $2,432,000 from $2,380,000 in fiscal 2015, compared with fiscal 2014, as a result of an increase in the average outstanding borrowings due to the funding of acquisitions, partially offset by the recording of an $113,000 charge in fiscal 2014 for the ineffective hedge on our term credit facility and an $84,000 charge in fiscal 2014 to expense the remaining debt issuance costs on our term credit facility, as further explained in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $21,198,000, or 35.9%, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to the increase in net income (after adjusting for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, fair value adjustments of acquisition related liabilities, loss on sale of business, impairment of assets and deferred income taxes) and increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities (due to the timing of payments), partially offset by increases in inventories (due to planned strategic increases in stock levels of certain products primarily in our Endoscopy segment) and accounts receivables (due to strong sales of endoscopy products and services).\nFor purposes of translating the balance sheet at July 31, 2016 compared with July 31, 2015, the total of the foreign currency movements resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $13,019,000 for fiscal 2016, primarily due to the increase in the value of the United States dollar relative to the Euro, Canadian dollar and British Pound, thereby decreasing stockholders' equity.\nAssumed Contingent Liabilities\n (1) Amounts are recorded in general and administrative expenses. \nBusiness Combinations\n\t\t\t\nWith respect to interest rate risk, since our credit facility consists of outstanding debt at prevailing market rates of interest, principally under LIBOR contracts ranging from one to twelve months, our market risk with respect to such debt is the increase in interest expense which would result from higher interest rates associated with LIBOR. Our outstanding debt of $171,000,000 at September 29, 2016 has expected annual interest payments of approximately $3,830,000 using an effective interest rate of 2.24% as described above. Therefore, a 100 basis-point increase in average LIBOR interest rates would result in incremental interest expense of approximately $1,710,000. We monitor our interest rate risk, but presently do not utilize any interest rate derivatives that would mitigate our interest rate exposure. However, all of our outstanding borrowings were under LIBOR contracts at September 29, 2016 that have expiration dates ranging from one to twelve months at fixed interest rates for the contract periods; therefore, we are substantially protected throughout the majority of fiscal 2017 from any significant exposure associated with increasing LIBOR rates, assuming we do not increase our outstanding debt. Additionally, we maintained a cash balance of $28,367,000 at July 31, 2016 which is maintained in cash or invested in low risk and low return cash equivalents such as United States money market funds with leading banking institutions. An increase in interest rates would generate additional interest\nNet sales of dialysis products and services increased by $1,510,000, or 4.8% in fiscal 2016 when compared with fiscal 2015, principally due to (i) an increase in demand for our concentrate product by a single customer, which demand is expected to decline in fiscal 2017, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our sterilant products and RENATRON\u00ae reprocessing equipment due to the market shift from reusable to single-use dialyzers, as further described below.\n\nCash Dividends\nStock compensation expense is recognized for any option or stock award grant based upon the award's fair value. All of our stock options and stock awards (which consist only of restricted stock) are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period, as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period. We recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight-line basis, reduced by estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.\nOverview\nGross profit increased by $55,719,000 or 22.0%, to $309,186,000 in fiscal 2016 from $253,467,000 in fiscal 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2016 and 2015 was 46.5% and 44.9%, respectively. Excluding the impact of acquisition accounting charges, gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2016 and 2015 was 46.7% and 45.2%, respectively.\n\t\t\nThe decrease in the consolidated effective tax rate in fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, was due to the (i) adverse impact of the divesture of our specialty packaging business in the prior year and (ii) the favorable impact in the current year from the enactment of tax legislation in the United States and internationally, partially offset by higher non-deductible acquisition related items in fiscal 2016, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A. Additionally, the current year consolidated effective tax rate was favorably impacted by improved operating results of our international operations, which are located in lower tax rate jurisdictions. A reconciliation of the consolidated effective income rate for fiscals 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\nOn April 7, 2015, we completed the sale of our Specialty Packaging business to a global packaging and service company, as further described elsewhere in this MD&A and in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overall, this transaction, including costs associated with the disposition and the recognition of a foreign currency translation gain, resulted in a $2,206,000 loss, or $0.04 in diluted earnings per share, which was recorded in loss on sale of business in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Since the divestiture of a business is atypical and non-operating in nature and the loss on sale masks our underlying operating performance, we excluded the loss on sale of business for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures for fiscal 2015.\nWe cannot provide assurances that our gross profit percentage will not be adversely affected in the future (i) by uncertainties associated with our product mix, (ii) by price competition, or (iii) if raw materials and distribution costs increase and we are unable to implement offsetting price increases.\n \u00b7 enhanced profitability in our Healthcare Disposables segment mainly due to (i) increased sales of higher margin products such as sterility assurance and waterline disinfection products, (ii) lower manufacturing costs and (iii) lower amortization expense, partially offset by elevated demand of our face masks and sterility assurance products in the first half of the prior year as a result of (a) customers buying products in advance of certain sales price increases and (b) customer response to the Ebola virus, \nConsolidated Results of Operations\nCompensation Agreements\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n \u00b7 Diluted Earnings Per Share ( EPS\u201d) increased by 25.2% to $1.44 from $1.15. \nGeneral corporate expenses relate to unallocated corporate costs primarily related to executive management personnel, costs associated with certain facets of our acquisition program and being a publicly traded company. Such expenses increased by $2,381,000, or 14.8%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to (i) the addition of internal and external resources to address various growth initiatives and compliance requirements, (ii) costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Financial Officer and recruiting of executive personnel, (iii) increases in costs associated with our acquisition program, and (iv) increases in annual salaries and stock-based compensation.\n \u00b7 Net income under United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) increased by 25.0% to $59,953,000 from $47,953,000. \nGeneral Corporate Expenses\nAcquisitions require significant estimates and judgments related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We determine fair value based on the estimated price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Such initial fair value amounts as well as other acquired assets and liabilities, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, are sometimes refined requiring subsequent adjustments.\nWater Purification and Filtration Segment\nIn December 2015, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 was signed into law and included a two-year moratorium effective January 1, 2016 on the medical device excise tax, which was a tax on medical device manufacturers in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on all U.S. medical device sales. A significant portion of our net sales are considered U.S. medical device sales and therefore our gross profit percentage will continue to be favorably impacted by this moratorium until the two-year moratorium expires. However, we are investing a significant portion of the savings from this moratorium into sales and marketing and product development initiatives.\ninternational markets, and to gain or maintain market share by hiring and training additional sales and marketing personnel and increasing travel budgets in our Endoscopy, Water Purification and Filtration and Healthcare Disposables segments, (iii) the inclusion of selling and marketing expenses of acquisitions, and (iv) increases in annual salaries. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $884,000 in selling expense for fiscal 2016 relating to our specialty packaging business divested in April 2015.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities also include items recorded in conjunction with the purchase accounting for business acquisitions as well as net operating loss carryforwards. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets, as adjusted for valuation allowances, will be realized. Additionally, deferred tax liabilities are regularly reviewed to confirm that such amounts are appropriately stated. A review of our deferred tax items considers known future changes in various income tax rates, principally in the United States. If income tax rates were to change in the future, particularly in the United States and to a lesser extent Canada, the United Kingdom and Italy, our items of deferred tax could be materially affected. All of such evaluations require significant management judgments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n\t\t\nInternational net sales increased by $32,544,000, or 27.8%, to $149,700,000 in fiscal 2016 from $117,156,000 in fiscal 2015. The 27.8% increase in net sales consist of (i) an increase of 12.5% in organic sales, (ii) an increase of 17.5% in net sales due to acquisitions, and (iii) a decrease of 2.2% in net sales due to foreign currency translation.\nThe higher gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2015 and 2014, was primarily attributable to more favorable sales mix due to increases in sales volume of certain products that carry higher gross margin percentages such as our (i) sterilants, filters and procedure products in our Endoscopy segment, (ii) sterilants, filters and certain equipment products in our Water Purification and Filtration segment, and (iii) face masks, disinfectants, sterility assurance products and our acquired DentaPure products in our Healthcare Disposables segment. These items were partially offset by (i) acquisition accounting charges for fiscal 2015 of $1,981,000, relating to fair value adjustments of inventory and deferred revenue acquired in the acquisitions of DentaPure, IMS and PuriCore and (ii) the inclusion in our Endoscopy segment of the PuriCore Acquisition, which had a lower gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisition accounting charges, gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2015 and 2014 were 45.2% and 43.6%, respectively.\nCash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities\n\t\t\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\t\t\nRent expense related to operating leases for fiscal 2016 was recorded on a straight-line basis and aggregated $6,675,000, compared with $6,025,000 and $4,409,000 for fiscals 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nRefer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of July 31, 2016.\nNet sales of healthcare disposables products increased by $5,664,000, or 5.3%, in fiscal 2016 when compared with fiscal 2015. The 5.3% increase in net sales consist of (i) increase of 0.3% in organic net sales and (ii) increase of 5.0% in net sales due to acquisitions. Organic net sales for fiscal 2016 were similar to fiscal 2015 as the increase in sales of sterility assurance and waterline disinfection products in the current year were offset by the elevated demand during the first half of the prior year for our face masks and certain sterilization products as a result of (i) customers buying products in advance of certain sales price increases and (ii) customer response to the Ebola virus.\n\t\t\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $19,566,000, or 25.1%, to $97,463,000 in fiscal 2016 from $77,897,000 in fiscal 2015. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to (i) the inclusion of general and administrative expenses of our acquisitions, (ii) the impact of atypical items relating to acquisitions and costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Executive Officer, partially offset by the prior year impairment of an acquired license, as further described below and within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, and (iii) increases in annual salaries and incentive compensation including stock-based compensation.\n (i) Some of our key financial results for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 were as follows: \nMinimum commitments under operating leases include minimum rental commitments for our leased manufacturing facilities, warehouses, office space and equipment.\nNet sales of water purification and filtration products and services increased by $3,835,000, or 2.2%, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015. The 2.2% increase in net sales consist of (i) an increase of 1.0% in organic net sales, (ii) an increase of 1.6% in net sales due to acquisitions and (iii) decrease of 0.4% in net sales due to foreign currency translation. The increase in organic net sales was primarily due to an increase in demand for our (i) sterilants products, (ii) service and (iii) water purification equipment used for commercial and industrial (large capital) applications.\n\t\t\nThe reconciliations of diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS were calculated as follows:\nResearch and development expenses (which include continuing engineering costs) increased by $1,388,000, or 9.9%, to $15,410,000 in fiscal 2016 from $14,022,000 in fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to additional product development initiatives primarily in our Endoscopy segment, including the inclusion of projects relating to recent acquisitions.\nResults of Operations\nCredit Facility and Interest Rate Market Risk\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNet sales of water purification and filtration products and services increased by $14,329,000, or 8.9%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily attributable to (i) higher sales of our capital equipment, consumables and service in the dialysis industry mainly attributable to our expanding service network as well as the increased overall demand driven by the growing number of dialysis patients and clinics in the United States and the increasing market acceptance of the disinfection efficacy and cost benefits of our heat sanitized water purification systems, which carry higher average selling prices than the systems with the traditional non-heated sanitization and to a much lesser extent (ii) the inclusion of net sales generated by the PWS Acquisition. Excluding net sales relating to the PWS Acquisition, organic net sales in our Water Purification and Filtration segment increased by 6.8% for fiscal 2015.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nTax legislation was enacted in the United States and internationally that enabled us to record favorable tax benefits in our second quarter of fiscal 2016 relating to the entire calendar 2015. Since these favorable tax benefits are largely unrelated to our current year's income before taxes and is unrepresentative of our normal effective tax rate, we excluded its impact on net income and EPS for fiscal 2016 for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current performance and a comparison to past performance.\n\t\t\t\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\nChanges in the value of the Euro, British Pound, Singapore dollar, Canadian dollar and the Chinese Renminbi against the United States dollar affect our results of operations because certain cash bank accounts, accounts receivable and liabilities of Cantel and its subsidiaries are denominated and ultimately settled in United States dollars or these foreign currencies, but must be converted into each entity's functional currency. Furthermore, the financial statements of most of our international subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and therefore are impacted by changes in the international entities' functional currency relative to the United States dollar.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDAS as EBITDAS excluding the same atypical items as previously described as adjustments to net income. We use Adjusted EBITDAS when evaluating the operating performance of the Company because we believe the exclusion of such atypical items, of which a significant portion are non-cash items, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of on-going core operating results and to evaluate comparative results period over period.\nLong-Term Contractual Obligations\n\t\t\t\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nIn fiscal 2014, our Board of Directors approved a 22.0% increase in the semi-annual cash dividend to $0.045 per share of outstanding common stock, which was paid on each of January 31, 2014 and July 31, 2014 and totaled $3,721,000.\nThe Dialysis segment's operating income decreased by $798,000, or 10.6%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to a decrease in demand for our sterilant product and RENATRON\u00ae dialyzer reprocessing equipment, partially offset by an increase in demand for our low margin concentrate product. See Risk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIncome Taxes\nThe consolidated effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 was adversely affected by initial operating losses of our international operations located in lower tax rate jurisdictions, as well as the $2,206,000 loss on sale of our Specialty Packaging business, as further described elsewhere in this MD&A and in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to the inability to currently deduct a capital loss and the uncertainty of utilizing a capital loss tax benefit in the future, a tax benefit was not recognized on a portion of the loss on sale of the Specialty Packaging business, thereby increasing our consolidated effective tax rate.\nAcquisition related items consist of (i) fair value adjustments to contingent consideration and other contingent liabilities resulting from acquisitions, (ii) due diligence, integration, legal fees and other transaction costs associated with our acquisition program and (iii) acquisition accounting charges for the amortization of the initial fair value adjustments of acquired inventory and deferred revenue. The adjustments of contingent consideration and other contingent liabilities are periodic adjustments to record such amounts at fair value at each balance sheet date. Given the subjective nature of the assumptions used in the determination of fair value calculations, fair value adjustments may potentially cause significant earnings volatility that are not representative of our operating results. Similarly, due diligence, integration, legal and other acquisition costs associated with our acquisition program, including acquisition accounting charges relating to recording acquired inventory and deferred revenue at fair market value, can be significant and also adversely impact our effective tax rate as certain costs are often not tax-deductible. Since all of these acquisition related items are atypical and often mask underlying operating performance, we excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to past operating performance.\n \u00b7 Endoscopy: Medical device reprocessing systems, disinfectants, detergents and other supplies used to high-level disinfect rigid endoscopes, flexible endoscopes and other instrumentation and disposable infection control products intended to reduce the challenges associated with proper cleaning and high-level disinfection of numerous reusable components used in gastrointestinal ( GI\u201d) endoscopy procedures, pulmonary endoscopy and other procedures that require the reprocessing of medical equipment. In September 2015, this segment commenced the sale of endoscope transport and storage systems, and a number of endoscopy consumable accessories. Additionally, this segment includes technical maintenance service on its products. \nThe reconciliations of net income to EBITDAS and Adjusted EBITDAS were calculated as follows:\n \u00b7 the impact of atypical items relating to acquisitions and costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Executive Officer, partially offset by the prior year atypical items, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, and \nResults of Operations provides a discussion of the consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014.\nInterest income increased by $20,000 to $88,000 in fiscal 2016 from $68,000 in fiscal 2015.\n \u00b7 Healthcare Disposables: Single-use, infection prevention and control healthcare products including face masks, sterilization pouches, towels and bibs, tray covers, saliva ejectors, plastic cups, germicidal wipes and disinfectants, as well as a product for maintaining safe dental unit waterlines. This segment also manufactures and sells biological and chemical indicators for sterility assurance monitoring services in the acute-care, alternate-care, dental and industrial (medical device, life science and other manufacturers) markets. In August 2016, this segment commenced the manufacture and sale of nitrous oxide conscious sedation equipment and related single-use disposables. \n (vi) On October 16, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in the semi-annual cash dividend to $0.06 per share of outstanding common stock, which was paid on each of January 29, 2016 and July 29, 2016, as more fully described elsewhere in this MD&A. ", "item_7_text": "Net sales of healthcare disposables products increased by $5,111,000, or 5.0%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 principally due to increases in customer demand in the United States for our face masks, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA)-based high-level disinfectant and sterility assurance products as well as the inclusion of net sales generated by the DentaPure Acquisition, which was completed on February 20, 2015. Excluding net sales relating to the DentaPure Acquisition, organic net sales in our Healthcare Disposables segment increased by 3.7% for fiscal 2015.\n \u00b7 higher sales and improved profitability in our Dialysis segment primarily due to an increase in demand for our lower margin concentrate product, \nWe evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets including property, equipment and other assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An assessment is made to determine if the sum of the expected future non-discounted cash flows from the use of the assets and eventual disposition is less than the carrying value. If the sum of the expected non-discounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized based on fair value. With the exception of the impairment on an acquired license as further described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our historical assessments of our long-lived assets have not differed significantly from the actual amounts realized. However, the determination of fair value requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates and is highly subjective. On July 31, 2016, management concluded that no other events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the carrying amount of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $12,858,000, or 19.8%, to $77,897,000 in fiscal 2015 from $65,039,000 in fiscal 2014 primarily due to (i) the inclusion of general and administrative expenses of DentaPure, PWS\nRevenue on service sales is recognized when repairs are completed at the customer's location or when repairs are completed at our facilities and the products are shipped to customers. With respect to certain service contracts in our Endoscopy and Water Purification and Filtration operating segments, service revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement.\nThe 2014 Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants reasonably customary for similar credit facilities and is secured by (i) substantially all assets of Cantel and its United States-based subsidiaries, (ii) a pledge by Cantel of all of the outstanding shares of its United States-based subsidiaries and 65% of the outstanding shares of certain of Cantel's foreign-based subsidiaries, and (iii) a guaranty by Cantel's domestic subsidiaries. We are in compliance with all financial and other covenants under the 2014 Credit Agreement.\nThe increase in net debt was the result of an increase in the average outstanding borrowings due to the funding of the MI Acquisition in September 2015 and the NAMSA Acquisition in March 2016, partially offset by repayments.\nWe define non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS as net income and diluted EPS, respectively, adjusted to exclude amortization, acquisition related items, significant reorganization and restructuring charges, major tax events and other significant items management deems atypical or non-operating in nature.\n\t\t\t\nThe Healthcare Disposables segment's operating income increased by $1,184,000, or 6.3% in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in net sales, as further explained above, partially offset by (i) an increase of $280,000 of acquisition related charges primarily relating to the fair value adjustment of DentaPure's inventory, (ii) the hiring of additional sales personnel, and (iii) annual salary raises. Excluding acquisition related charges further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, the Healthcare Disposables segment's operating income increased by $1,464,000, or 7.8% in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014.\nIn fiscal 2014, net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to repayments under our credit facilities, partially offset by borrowings under our revolving credit facility for the PuriCore Acquisition.\nSelling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 14.9% in fiscal 2016 compared with 14.3% in fiscal 2015.\nAt July 31, 2016, our working capital was $126,407,000, compared with $117,737,000 at July 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the MI and NAMSA Acquisitions as well as the sale of our Specialty Packaging business.\nWe do not have any off balance sheet financial arrangements, other than future commitments under operating leases and executive severance and license agreements.\nOperating Expenses\n \u00b7 Water Purification and Filtration: Water purification equipment and services, filtration and separation products, and disinfectant, sterilization and decontamination products and services for the medical, pharmaceutical, biotech, beverage and commercial industrial markets. \nWe believe that our current cash position, anticipated cash flows from operations and the funds available under our 2014 Credit Agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our worldwide cash operating requirements for the foreseeable future based upon our existing operations, particularly given that we historically have not needed to borrow for working capital purposes. At September 29, 2016, $79,000,000 was available under our 2014 Credit Agreement.\nAdditionally, other long-term obligations include deferred compensation arrangements for certain former Medivators directors and officers and is recorded in other long-term liabilities.\nWe perform our annual impairment review for indefinite lived intangibles by first assessing qualitative factors, such as those described above, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of such assets is less than the carrying values, and if necessary, we perform a quantitative analysis comparing the current fair value of our indefinite lived intangibles assets to their carrying values. At July 31, 2016, because we determined through qualitative factors that the fair values of all of our indefinite lived intangible assets were unlikely to be less than the carrying value, we did not perform a quantitative analysis for those assets. With respect to amortizable intangible assets when impairment indicators are present, management would determine whether expected future non-discounted cash flows would be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets; if not, the carrying value of the assets would be adjusted to their fair value.\nForeign Currency Market Risk\nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 13.8% in fiscal 2015 compared with 13.3% in fiscal 2014.\nThe Water Purification and Filtration segment's operating income increased by $14,000, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily as a result of higher sales, partially offset by increases in annual salaries, the hiring of additional sales personnel, increased travel budgets and higher charges for warranty related to our water purification equipment.\n\t\t\t\n \u00b7 our strategic decision to invest in various growth initiatives designed to expand into new markets and gain or maintain market share in our three largest segments, \nThe reconciliations of net income to non-GAAP net income were calculated as follows:\n\t\t\n \u00b7 Net sales increased by 17.7% to $664,755,000 from $565,004,000; organic sales (i.e. excluding acquisitions, a divestiture and foreign currency translation) increased by 12.7%. \nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 14.7% in fiscal 2016 compared with 13.8% in fiscal 2015.\nEndoscopy Segment\nDialysis Segment\n\t\t\t\n (1) The summation of each diluted EPS does not equal the adjusted diluted EPS due to rounding. \nThe following table shows significant components of our cash flows for fiscals 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n \u00b7 an increase in interest expense due to the funding of acquisitions. \nOverall, fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange had an insignificant impact upon our net income in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015.\nand IMS for the portion of fiscal 2015 subsequent to their acquisition dates, (ii) the inclusion of general and administrative expenses of Jet Prep, Sterilator and PuriCore for the portion of fiscal 2014 subsequent to their fiscal 2014 acquisition dates compared with twelve months of such expenses in fiscal 2015, (iii) an increase of $2,624,000 in intangible amortization as a result of acquisitions, (iv) an increase of $1,308,000 in acquisition related charges primarily in our Endoscopy segment, (v) a $1,287,000 asset impairment charge in fiscal 2015 relating to an acquired license in our Endoscopy segment, and (vi) increases in annual salaries and incentive compensation including stock-based compensation. These items were partially offset by a favorable net change of $2,804,000 in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 for fair value adjustments of contingent liabilities primarily associated with the Jet Prep Acquisition in our Endoscopy segment, as further described elsewhere in this MD&A and in Notes 3 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as fiscal 2014 costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Financial Officer. Excluding (i) current and prior year amortization expense, (ii) current and prior year significant acquisition related items such as transaction and integration charges and fair value adjustments, (iii) the current year impairment of an acquired license, and (iv) prior year costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Financial Officer, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, general and administrative expenses increased by $11,087,000, or 21.1%, to $63,747,000 in fiscal 2015 from $52,660,000 in fiscal 2014.\nWarranties\nWe define net debt as long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents. Each of the components of net debt appears in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe that the presentation of net debt provides useful information to investors because we review net debt as part of our management of our overall liquidity, financial flexibility, capital structure and leverage.\n \u00b7 Dialysis: Medical device reprocessing systems, sterilants/disinfectants, dialysate concentrates and other supplies for renal dialysis. \nExcluding (i) current and prior year amortization expense, (ii) current and prior year acquisition related items such as transaction and integration charges and fair value adjustments, (iii) current year costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Executive Officer and (iv) the prior year impairment of an acquired license, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, general and administrative expenses increased by $14,880,000, or 23.3%, to $78,627,000 in fiscal 2016. Approximately a third of these increases are attributable to the inclusion of general and administrative expenses of our acquisitions.\nThe Water Purification and Filtration segment's operating income increased by $4,856,000, or 18.9%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of higher sales and improved gross profit percentage, as further explained above, partially offset by increases in annual salaries and the hiring of additional sales personnel.\nIn fiscal 2016, we announced the retirement plans of our Chief Executive Officer and recorded the majority of the costs associated with his retirement in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Since these costs are atypical and masks our underlying operating performance, we made an adjustment to our net income and EPS for fiscal 2016 to exclude such costs to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n\t\t\nWe define organic sales as net sales, calculated according to United States GAAP, less (i) the impact of foreign currency translation and (ii) net sales related to acquired businesses during the first twelve months of ownership and divestures during the periods being compared. We believe that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior periods. We exclude the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size, and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and can obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of financial performance difficult. The reconciliation of net sales to organic sales can be found elsewhere in this MD&A in Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015.\u201d\n (3) Amounts are recorded in income taxes. \n \u00b7 significantly higher sales and profitability in our Endoscopy segment principally due to (i) increases in demand for endoscope reprocessing equipment, higher margin products such as disposable infection control products used in GI endoscopy procedures, and endoscope reprocessing disinfectants and service as a result of the increased field population of equipment and (ii) the inclusion of sales of recent acquisitions, \n\t\t\nOther Matters\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $60,688,000, or 116.1%, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 primarily due to an increase in cash consideration paid for acquisitions.\n\nThe operating income of our Specialty Packaging business, which was reported in the Other reporting segment and divested on April 7, 2015, as further described elsewhere in this MD&A and in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, increased by $303,000 for the portion of fiscal 2015 prior to its divestiture compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in demand for our specialty packaging products resulting from the Ebola virus as well as recording foreign exchange gains associated with translating certain United States dollar denominated assets into our subsidiary's functional currency, the Canadian dollar.\nThe Endoscopy segment's operating income increased by $6,669,000, or 19.5%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to increases in demand in the United States and internationally for our endoscopy products and services, as further explained above, and a favorable net change of $2,804,000 in general and administrative expenses relating to fair value contingent liabilities adjustments that were favorable in fiscal 2015 compared to moderately unfavorable in fiscal 2014, as further described Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These items were partially offset by (i) increased investment in our sales team and other selling initiatives, (ii) lower selling prices of certain endoscopy products, (iii) an increase in acquisition related charges, (iv) increased research and development expenses due to additional product development initiatives, (v) increased intangible amortization as a result of acquisitions, (vi) a $1,287,000 asset impairment charge in fiscal 2015 relating to an acquired license, and (vii) increases in annual salaries and incentive compensation. Excluding the fair value adjustments, acquisition related charges and the asset impairment stated above and further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, the Endoscopy segment's operating income increased by $7,922,000, or 22.5% in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014.\nIn fiscal 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $29,942,000, compared with $6,105,000 used in financing activities in fiscal 2015. The fiscal 2016 net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the MI and NAMSA Acquisitions, partially offset by repayments under our credit facility.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we continually evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\t\t\nNet Sales\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nOn July 31, 2016, we had $116,000,000 of outstanding borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement. Subsequent to July 31, 2016, we borrowed $61,000,000 to fund the purchase price and transaction costs of the Accutron and Vantage acquisitions and repaid $6,000,000 resulting in total outstanding borrowings of $171,000,000 at September 29, 2016, none of which is required to be repaid until March 2019.\nThe Dialysis segment's operating income increased by $1,158,000, or 17.2% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to (i) an increase in sales for our low margin concentrate product to a single customer and (ii) successful cost control initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our higher margin sterilant products and RENATRON\u00ae reprocessing equipment.\nAccounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities. Allowances for doubtful accounts are reserves for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments. We use historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate. While actual losses have historically been within management's expectations and provisions established, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Alternatively, if certain customers paid their delinquent receivables, reductions in allowances may be required.\nThe increase in both domestic and international organic net sales for fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to increases in net sales of our endoscopy products and services due to increases in demand for (i) endoscope reprocessing equipment, (ii) higher margin products such as disposable infection control products used in GI endoscopy procedures, and (iii) endoscope reprocessing disinfectants and service as a result of the increased field population of equipment, as further described below in Endoscopy Segment.\u201d\nStock-Based Compensation\nInventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished products which are sold in the ordinary course of our business and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. In assessing the value of inventories, we must make estimates and judgments regarding reserves required for product obsolescence, aging of inventories and other issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products. In performing such evaluations, we use historical experience as well as current market information. With few exceptions, the saleable value of our inventories has historically been within management's expectation and provisions established, however, rapid changes in the market due to competition, technology and various other factors could have an adverse effect on the saleable value of our inventories, resulting in the need for additional reserves.\nWe have previously entered into various severance contracts with executives of the Company, including our corporate executive officers and certain of our subsidiary Chief Executive Officers, which define certain compensation arrangements relating to various employment termination scenarios, and multi-year employment agreements with certain executive officers of businesses we have acquired. Additionally, in March 2016 we entered into a succession plan agreement due to the planned retirement of our Chief Executive Officer who was succeeded on July 31, 2016, but remains employed as a Senior Advisor until October 15, 2016. This succession plan agreement requires future payments to our former Chief Executive Officer beginning in fiscal 2017 for transition-related services. The majority of those future payments are being recorded in general and administrative expenses from March 17, 2016 through his October 15, 2016 retirement date.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nOther Long-Term Obligation\nCertain liabilities and reserves are subjective in nature. We reflect such liabilities and reserves based upon the most recent information available. In conjunction with our acquisitions, such subjective liabilities and reserves principally include contingent consideration, certain deferred income tax liabilities, income tax and sales and use tax exposures, including tax liabilities related to our foreign subsidiaries, as well as reserves for accounts receivable, inventories, warranties and contingent obligations. We account for contingent consideration relating to business combinations as a liability and an increase to goodwill at the date of the acquisition and continually re-measure the liability at each balance sheet date by recording changes in the fair value through our Consolidated Statements of Income. We determine the fair value of contingent consideration based on future operating projections under various potential scenarios and weight the probability of these outcomes. Similarly, other acquisition related liabilities can be required to be recorded at fair value at the date of the acquisition and continually re-measured at each balance sheet date, such as the assumed contingent obligation relating to the Jet Prep Acquisition and the contingent guaranteed obligation relating to the PuriCore Acquisition, as further described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The ultimate settlement of liabilities relating to business combinations may be for amounts which are materially different from the amounts initially recorded and may cause volatility in our results of operations.\nInterest income increased by $5,000 to $68,000 in fiscal 2015 from $63,000 in fiscal 2014.\nMost of our equipment, consumables and supplies are used to help prevent the occurrence or spread of infections.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help you understand Cantel Medical Corp. ( Cantel\u201d). The MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Our MD&A includes the following sections:\n\t\t\t\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $4,862,000, or 10.3%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in cash consideration paid for acquisitions.\nInterest expense increased by $976,000 to $3,408,000 in fiscal 2016 from $2,432,000 in fiscal 2015, as a result of an increase in the average outstanding borrowings due to the funding of the MI and NAMSA Acquisitions in September 2015 and March 2016, respectively.\nFuture declaration of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of the Company's Board of Directors.\nWe first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount before proceeding to step one of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, if necessary. Such qualitative factors that are assessed include evaluating a segment's financial performance, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions and specific issues that can directly affect the segment such as changes in business strategies, competition, supplier relationships, operating costs, regulatory matters, litigation and the composition of the segment's assets due to acquisitions or other events. At July 31, 2016, because we determined through qualitative factors that the fair values of our Endoscopy, Water Purification and Filtration and Healthcare Disposables segments were unlikely to be less than the carrying value, we did not proceed to step one of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for those three segments. We performed step one of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for Dialysis due to the continuing shift by our customers from reusable to single-use dialyzers, which is having an adverse impact on our business and is expected to continue, as further described in Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this MD&A. In performing a detailed quantitative review for goodwill impairment, management uses a two-step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the related operating segments by using weighted fair value results of the discounted cash flow methodology, as well as the market multiple and comparable transaction methodologies, where applicable. The first step is a review for potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of impairment, if any.\nA portion of our endoscopy, water purification and filtration and dialysis sales are recognized as multiple element arrangements, whereby revenue is allocated to the equipment, installation and consumable components based upon vendor specific objective evidence, which includes comparable historical transactions of similar equipment, installation and consumables sold as stand-alone components. If vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price is not available, we allocate revenue to the elements of the bundled arrangement using the estimated selling price method in order to qualify the components as separate units of accounting. Revenue on the equipment and consumables components are recognized as the equipment or consumable is shipped to customers and title passes. Revenue on the installation component is recognized when the installation is complete.\nIn fiscal 2015, we conducted a strategic review of our Specialty Packaging business and evaluated its potential value in the marketplace relative to the business's historic and expected returns and concluded that the business was not part of our core strategy and could return a higher value to stockholders by its divestiture. Accordingly, our Specialty Packaging business (reported in the Other reporting segment) was classified as held-for-sale within our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet beginning October 31, 2014. Since the operating results of the Specialty Packaging segment, as shown in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, were not significant in relation to our overall consolidated operating results, the lack of operating results from this business due to its divestiture did not have a major effect on our operations and financial results, and accordingly, has not been classified as a discontinued operation for any of the periods presented.\nincome for us from these low risk cash equivalents, which would partially offset the adverse impact of the additional interest expense. Our other long-term liabilities would not be materially affected by an increase in interest rates.\nCantel is a leading provider of infection prevention products and services in the healthcare market, specializing in the following operating segments:\n (iv) In our prior fiscal year, we acquired (i) all of the issued and outstanding stock of MRLB International, Inc. ( MRLB\u201d) on February 20, 2015 (the DentaPure Acquisition\u201d), (ii) certain net assets of Pure Water Solutions, Inc. ( PWS\u201d) on January 1, 2015 (the PWS Acquisition\u201d) and (iii) all of the issued and outstanding stock of International Medical Service S.r.l. ( IMS\u201d) on November 3, 2014 (the IMS Acquisition\u201d), as more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, the results of operations of MRLB, PWS and IMS are included in our consolidated results of operations in fiscal 2016 and the portions of fiscal 2015 subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Their results of operations are not included in our results in fiscal 2014. The businesses of MRLB (the DentaPure Business\u201d), PWS (the PWS Business\u201d) and IMS (the IMS Business\u201d) did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations due to the size of the businesses in relation to our overall consolidated results of operations. The DentaPure Business is included in our Healthcare Disposables segment, the PWS Business is included in our Water Purification and Filtration segment and the IMS Business is included in our Endoscopy segment. Subsequent to the IMS Acquisition, we changed the name of International Medical Service S.r.l. to Cantel Medical (Italy) S.r.l. \n \u00b7 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 46.5% from 44.9%. \nRevenue on product sales is recognized as products are shipped to customers and title passes. The passing of title is determined based upon the FOB terms specified for each shipment. With respect to endoscopy and dialysis products, shipment terms are generally FOB origin for common carrier and when our distribution fleet is utilized (except for one large customer in dialysis and several endoscopy customers whereby all products are shipped FOB destination). With respect to water purification and filtration and healthcare disposable products, shipment terms may be either FOB origin or destination. Customer acceptance for the majority of our product sales occurs at the time of delivery. With respect to a portion of water purification and filtration and endoscopy product sales, equipment is sold as part of a system for which the equipment is functionally interdependent or the customer's purchase order specifies ship-complete\u201d as a condition of delivery; revenue recognition on such sales is deferred until all equipment has been delivered, or post-delivery obligations such as installation have been substantially fulfilled such that the products are deemed functional by the end-user. All shipping and handling fees invoiced to customers, such as freight, are recorded as revenue (and related costs are included within cost of sales) at the time the sale is recognized.\n (2) In fiscal 2016, acquisition related items of $959 and $2,254 were recorded in cost of sales and general administrative expenses, respectively. In fiscal 2015, acquisition related items of $1,981 and ($402) were recorded in cost of sales and general administrative expenses, respectively. In fiscal 2014, all acquisition related items were recorded in general and administrative expenses. \nGross Profit\nIn fiscal 2015, net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to repayments under our credit facility, partially offset by borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the acquisitions of IMS, PWS and DentaPure acquisitions.\nSignificant Activity\nManagement concluded that none of our intangible assets or goodwill was impaired as of July 31, 2016.\nNet Sales\n\t\t\n (1) Primarily to fund the cash consideration paid and the costs associated with the Accutron and Vantage Acquisitions, we borrowed $55,000,000 in August 2016 and $6,000,000 in September 2016, respectively, under our revolving credit facility, and repaid $6,000,000, therefore increasing the 2019 maturities of the credit facility from $116,000,000 at July 31, 2016 to $171,000,000 at September 29, 2016. Accordingly, the expected interest payments under the credit facility will be approximately $1,232,000 higher on an annualized basis as of September 29, 2016 than the amounts shown herein. The expected interest payments under our credit facility reflect an interest rate of 2.24%, which was our weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings at July 31, 2016. \nOn April 7, 2015, we completed the sale of our Specialty Packaging business to a global packaging and service company by selling all the issued and outstanding stock of our Specialty Packaging subsidiary in exchange for $7,531,000 in cash proceeds, of which $660,000 is held in escrow for indemnity obligations, if any, until October 7, 2016 and is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, we\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\t\t\nInventories\nAlthough overall inflation did not have a significant effect on our business, an increase in commodity prices can adversely affect our gross margins. Specifically, our businesses can be adversely impacted by rising fuel and oil prices and are heavily reliant on certain raw materials, such as chemicals, paper, resin, stainless steel and plastic components. From time to time, we experience price increases for raw materials. If we are unable to implement price increases to our customers, our gross margins could be adversely affected.\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\nInflation\n\n\t\t\nOur operating segments generate significant cash from operations. At July 31, 2016, we had a cash balance of $28,367,000, of which $9,804,000 was held by foreign subsidiaries. Our foreign cash is needed by our foreign subsidiaries for working capital purposes as well as for current international growth initiatives. Accordingly, our foreign unremitted earnings are considered permanently reinvested and unavailable for repatriation.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nAmortization expense is a non-cash expense related to intangibles that were primarily the result of business acquisitions. Our history of acquiring businesses has resulted in significant increases in amortization of intangible assets that reduced the Company's net income. The removal of amortization from our overall operating performance helps in assessing our cash generated from operations including our return on invested capital, which we believe is an important analysis for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our continued growth.\nCritical Accounting Policies provides a discussion of our accounting policies that require critical judgments, assumptions and estimates.\nThe higher gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2016 and 2015 was primarily attributable to (i) more favorable sales mix due to increases in sales volume of certain products that carry higher gross margin percentages such as our procedure room products and disinfectants in our Endoscopy segment, sterility assurance and waterline disinfection products in our Healthcare Disposables segment and sterilants and filters in our Water Purification and Filtration segment, (ii) the inclusion of higher margin sales in our Endoscopy and Healthcare Disposables segments as a result of the MI and NAMSA Acquisitions, respectively, (iii) lower manufacturing costs and (iv) decrease of $2,334,000 in medical device excise tax due to the recent moratorium, as further explained below, partially offset by an increase in net sales of lower margin capital equipment primarily in our Endoscopy segment and higher charges for warranty primarily relating to our water purification equipment.\nThe reconciliations of debt to net debt were calculated as follows:\nOn March 4, 2014, we entered into a $250,000,000 Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2014 Credit Agreement\u201d). The 2014 Credit Agreement includes a five-year $250,000,000 senior secured revolving facility with sublimits of up to $100,000,000 for borrowings in foreign currencies, $30,000,000 for letters of credit and $10,000,000 for swing line loans (the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent including the consent of the lenders, the Company may from time to time increase the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed $100,000,000. The senior lenders include Bank of America N.A. (the lead bank and administrative agent), PNC Bank, National Association, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The 2014 Credit Agreement expires on March 4, 2019. Additionally, subject to certain restrictions and conditions (i) any of our domestic or foreign subsidiaries may become borrowers and (ii) borrowings may occur in multi-currencies.\nFor fiscal 2016, we made adjustments to net income and diluted EPS to exclude (i) amortization expense, (ii) significant acquisition related items impacting current operating performance including transaction and integration charges and ongoing fair value adjustments, (iii) costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Executive Officer and (iv) the impact of favorable tax legislation to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS.\n \u00b7 Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense ( Adjusted EBITDAS\u201d) increased by 21.2% to $137,949,000 from $113,811,000, as further described and reconciled to net income in Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in this MD&A. \nIn September 2013, we acquired a license from a third party granting us the exclusive right to manufacture, commercialize, distribute and sell an endoscopy product in its beginning stage of commercialization in exchange for a series of payments, which totaled $1,000,000 by our second quarter of fiscal 2015 and was recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We evaluated this long-lived asset in fiscal 2015 for potential impairment and determined that the future use of this acquired license was unlikely based on a recent product analysis. Accordingly, we deemed the acquired license, together with related fixed assets of $287,000 to be fully impaired and recorded a loss of $1,287,000 during fiscal 2015, which was recorded in general and administrative expenses and as reductions in other assets and property and equipment in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Since the acquisition of the license and subsequent impairment were outside our standard endoscopy business operations, we excluded the impairment of the acquired license for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to past operating performance.\nincurred approximately $1,128,000 in costs associated with the disposition of this business including bonuses associated with the sale, accelerated stock-based compensation and to a lesser extent certain advisory fees. Furthermore as a result of this disposition, we recognized a foreign currency translation gain of $1,264,000 in our Consolidated Statement of Income, which was recorded in stockholders' equity immediately preceding the disposition. Such foreign currency translation gain was a result of the monthly translation of the Specialty Packaging segment's balance sheets beginning in 2004, when the business was acquired. In addition, due to the inability to currently deduct a capital loss and the uncertainty of utilizing a capital loss tax benefit in the future, a tax benefit was not recognized on a portion of the recorded loss on sale of the business. Overall, this transaction, including costs associated with the disposition and the recognition of a foreign currency translation gain, resulted in a $2,206,000 loss, or $0.04 in diluted earnings per share, which was recorded in loss on sale of business in our Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2015. Such amount is subject to further adjustments for indemnity obligations, if any.\nWe continue to benefit from having a broad portfolio of infection prevention products and services sold into diverse business segments, where approximately 73% of our net sales are attributable to consumable products and service. The primary factors that contributed to this financial performance, as further described elsewhere in this MD&A, were as follows:\n\t\t\t\nWe record liabilities for an unrecognized tax benefit when a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, but is not recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements because it does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold that the uncertain tax position would be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. Any adjustments upon resolution of income tax uncertainties are recognized in our results of operations. Unrecognized tax benefits are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the related liability. Historically, we have not had significant unrecognized tax benefits.\nWe provide for estimated costs that may be incurred to remedy deficiencies of quality or performance of our products at the time of revenue recognition. Most of our products have a one year warranty, although certain endoscopy and water purification and filtration products that require installation may carry a warranty period of up to twenty-four months. Additionally, many of our consumables, accessories and parts have a 90 day warranty. We record provisions for product warranties as a component of cost of sales based upon an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on products sold. The historical relationship of warranty costs to products sold is the primary basis for the estimate. A significant increase in third party service repair rates, the cost and availability of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize. Management reviews its warranty exposure periodically and believes that the warranty reserves are adequate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from original estimates, requiring adjustments to the reserves.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nOperating Leases\nOur provision for income taxes is based on our current period income, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, statutory income tax rates, changes in uncertain tax benefits and the deductibility of expenses or availability of tax credits in various taxing jurisdictions. Tax laws are complex, subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing authorities and are subject to future modification, expiration or repeal\nIncome Taxes\nFinancing Needs\nResearch and development expense as a percentage of net sales were 2.3% and 2.5% in fiscals 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n (iii) In our current fiscal year, we acquired (i) all of the issued and outstanding stock of Medical Innovations Group Holdings Limited and certain affiliated companies (collectively, MI\u201d) on September 14, 2015 (the MI Acquisition\u201d) and (ii) certain net assets of North American Science Associates, Inc.'s Sterility Assurance Monitoring Products division ( NAMSA\u201d) on March 1, 2016 (the NAMSA Acquisition\u201d), as more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, the results of operations of MI and NAMSA are included in our consolidated results of operations for the portions of fiscal 2016 subsequent to their acquisition dates. The businesses of MI (the MI Business\u201d) and NAMSA (the NAMSA Business\u201d) are not included in our results of operations in fiscals 2015 and 2014. However, with the exception of acquisition related costs as more fully described in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below, their results of operations did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations in fiscal 2016 due to the size of the businesses in relation to our overall consolidated results of operations. The MI Business is included in our Endoscopy segment and NAMSA Business is included in the Healthcare Disposables segment. Subsequent to the MI Acquisition, we changed the name of Medical Innovations Group Holdings Limited to Cantel (UK) Limited. \nWorking Capital\nIn relation to the Jet Prep Acquisition, we have recorded at July 31, 2016 a $1,138,000 liability for the estimated fair value of an assumed contingent obligation payable to the Israeli Government, as further described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which will be payable based on future sales of the Jet Prep Business. Additionally, in connection with the PuriCore Acquisition, we assumed a contingent guaranteed obligation to reimburse an endoscope service company for endoscope repair costs it incurs when servicing its customers' endoscopes that are damaged by one of PuriCore's discontinued endoscope reprocessing machine models, as further described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As such, the estimates of the annual required payments as well as the fair value of these contingent liabilities are subjective in nature and highly dependent on future sales projections. Additionally, since we will be continually re-measuring these liabilities at each balance sheet date and recording changes in the respective fair values through our Consolidated Statements of Income, we may potentially have earnings volatility in our future results of operations until the assumed contingent obligation and contingent guaranteed obligation are satisfied, or until the sales of the Jet Prep products no longer exist.\nOur endoscopy products and services are sold directly to hospitals and other end-users in the United States and primarily to distributors internationally except for the United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Singapore, China and Germany where we sell directly to hospitals and other end-users; water purification and filtration products and services are sold directly to hospitals, dialysis clinics, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, laboratories, medical products and service companies and other end-users as well as through third-party distributors; the majority of our healthcare disposable products are sold to third party distributors and with respect to some of our sterility assurance products, to hospitals, surgery centers, physician and dental offices, dental schools, medical research companies, laboratories and other end-users; and the majority of our dialysis products are sold to dialysis clinics and hospitals. Sales to all of these customers follow our revenue recognition policies.\nInternational net sales increased by $32,299,000, or 38.1%, to $117,156,000 in fiscal 2015 from $84,857,000 in fiscal 2014. The increase in international net sales was primarily due to increases in net sales of endoscopy products and services in the United Kingdom and Italy as a result of the acquisitions of PuriCore and IMS. A significant portion of the net sales of the acquired United Kingdom business relates to product service, and therefore the acquisition was a significant reason for our worldwide product service net sales to increase by $17,130,000, or 31.6%, to $71,348,000 in fiscal 2015 from $54,218,000 in fiscal 2014.\n\t\t\t\n \u00b7 a lower effective tax rate due to the recording of certain atypical tax items, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A. \nWe use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency transactions. Market risk is defined here as the potential change in fair value resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. Overall for fiscals 2016 and 2015, a uniform 15% adverse movement in foreign currency rates would have resulted in realized losses (after tax) of approximately $1,680,000 and $1,371,000, respectively. Conversely, for fiscals 2016 and 2015, a uniform 15% favorable movement in foreign currency rates would have resulted in realized gains (after tax) of approximately $1,680,000 and $1,371,000, respectively.\n\t\t\nAs of July 31, 2016, aggregate annual required payments over the next five years and thereafter under our contractual obligations that have long-term components are as follows:\n\t\t\t\nLoss on Sale of Business\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $5,202,000, or 8.1%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to planned strategic increases in stock levels of certain products maintained in inventory primarily in our Endoscopy segment and the repayment of liabilities acquired in conjunction with the IMS Acquisition, partially offset by the increase in net income (after adjusting for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, loss on sale of business, impairment of assets, fair value adjustments of acquisition related liabilities and deferred income taxes).\n (3) These future potential payments of an assumed contingent liability relate to the Jet Prep Acquisition, as further explained below, and are reflected in the July 31, 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet at its net present value of $1,138,000 using a discount rate of 2.5%. \nNet sales of endoscopy products and services increased by $58,214,000, or 30.6%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014, primarily due to increases in demand in the United States and internationally for our (i) disinfectants, service, equipment accessories and filters due to the increase in the installed base of endoscope reprocessing equipment, (ii) procedure room products (disposable infection control products used in GI endoscopy procedures) and (iii) endoscope reprocessing equipment. Additionally, the increase in fiscal 2015 was attributable to the inclusion of net sales generated in the United Kingdom and Italy as a result of acquiring PuriCore on June 30, 2014 and IMS on November 3, 2014. Excluding the incremental net sales provided by these acquisitions, organic net sales in our Endoscopy segment increased by 15.5% for fiscal 2015. These increases were partially offset by overall lower selling prices in most endoscopy product offerings totaling approximately $4,100,000 as a result of strategic growth programs and increased competition, as well as the adverse impact on international sales of a stronger dollar relative to the euro, which accounted for approximately a third of the lower selling prices.\nThe following table gives information as to the net sales by reporting segment and geography (which represents the geographic area from which the Company derives its net sales from external customers), as well as the related percentage of such sales to the total net sales.\nFiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015\nIn evaluating our operating performance, we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) with certain internally driven non-GAAP financial measures, namely (i) non-GAAP net income, (ii) non-GAAP diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d), (iii) income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense ( EBITDAS\u201d), (iv) EBITDAS adjusted for atypical items ( Adjusted EBITDAS\u201d), (v) net debt and (vi) organic sales. These non-GAAP financial measures are indicators of the Company's performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. They are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to financial information used by us in our financial analysis and operational decision-making. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors, shareholders and other readers of our Consolidated Financial Statements in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from, or as an alternative to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nEndoscopy Segment\n \u00b7 Non-GAAP diluted EPS increased by 21.5% to $1.75 from $1.44, as further described and reconciled to diluted EPS in Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in this MD&A. \n\t\t\n (ii) We sell our dialysis products to a concentrated number of customers. Sales in our Dialysis segment have been adversely impacted in recent years by the decrease in demand for our products that are used by dialysis centers that reuse dialyzers, such as our sterilant products and RENATRON\u00ae reprocessing equipment. With the exception of the current year that had increased sales of low margin concentrate products, which are products not used in dialyzer reprocessing, this reduction in dialysis sales has reduced overall profitability in this segment relative to prior years. Our market for Dialysis reprocessing products is limited to dialysis centers that reuse dialyzers, which market has been decreasing in the United States despite the environmental advantages and our belief that the per-procedure cost of reuse dialyzers is more economical than single-use dialyzers. Based on discussions with customers, we expect the downward trend in reuse dialyzers in the United States will continue during fiscal 2017 and thereafter. A substantial reduction of our dialysis reuse business will likely have a significant adverse effect on our Dialysis segment and reduce our margins and net income in that segment as well as result in potential future impairments of long-lived assets. Such reduction would also adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. See Risk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \n\n (4) These future potential payments of a contingent guaranteed obligation relate to Cantel Medical (UK), as further explained below. \nA portion of our healthcare disposables sales relating to the mail-in spore test kit is recorded as deferred revenue when initially sold. We recognize the revenue on these test kits using an estimate based on historical experience\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nFor fiscal 2015, we made adjustments to net income and diluted EPS to exclude (i) amortization expense, (ii) significant acquisition related items impacting current operating performance including transaction and integration charges and ongoing fair value adjustments, (iii) the loss on sale of our Specialty Packaging business and (iv) the impairment of an acquired license to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS.\nFor fiscal 2014, we made adjustments to net income and diluted EPS to exclude (i) amortization expense, (ii) significant acquisition related items impacting current operating performance primarily relating to transaction charges and ongoing fair value adjustments, and (iii) costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Financial Officer to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures.\nIn relation to the IMS Acquisition on November 3, 2014, we assumed an $843,000 liability to the central bank of Italy as part of funding provided by an Italian government agency, of which $187,000 and $656,000 were recorded in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. Such amount was a portion of the financial support obtained from the Italian government's Ministry of Education, Universities and Research to fund research and development activity relating to IMS's automated endoscope reprocessors. The liability is payable in semi-annual installments, bears interest at 0.25% per annum and has a maturity date of January 1, 2019. At July 31, 2016, $415,000 is outstanding, of which $165,000 is recorded in accrued expense and $250,000 is recorded in other long-term liabilities.\nWhile the results of these annual reviews have historically not indicated impairment, impairment reviews are highly dependent on management's projections of our future operating results and cash flows (which management believes to be reasonable), discount rates based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital and appropriate benchmark peer companies. Assumptions used in determining future operating results and cash flows include current and expected market conditions and future sales and earnings forecasts. Subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could result in future impairment. Although we consistently use the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations, such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. At July 31, 2016, the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded book value by substantial amounts. However, we believe the most significant assumptions impacting the impairment assessment of Dialysis relate to the assumed rate in which annual sales will decline as well as the expected future operating efficiencies included in our projections of future operating results and cash flows of this segment. If future operating results and cash flows are substantially less than our projections, future impairment charges may be recorded.\nGross profit increased by $40,168,000, or 18.8%, to $253,467,000 in fiscal 2015 from $213,299,000 in fiscal 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2015 and 2014 was 44.9% and 43.6%, respectively.\n\t\t\t\nLiquidity and Capital Resources provides an overview of our working capital, cash flows, contractual obligations, financing and foreign currency activities.\n \u00b7 the prior year loss on sale relating to the divestiture of our specialty packaging business, and \nDialysis Segment\n\t\t\nGeneral corporate expenses relate to unallocated corporate costs primarily related to executive management personnel as well as costs associated with certain facets of our acquisition program and being a publicly traded company. Such expenses increased by $8,304,000, or 44.9% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to (i) $3,487,000 of costs recorded in the second half of fiscal 2016 associated with the retirement of our Chief Executive\n\t\t\t\n (2) Amounts include $4,500,000, of which $3,823,000 is payable in fiscal 2017, due to the planned retirement of our former CEO. Effective August 1, 2016 in conjunction with the Accutron Acquisition, we entered into additional compensation agreements which would increase fiscal years 2017 and 2018 by $400,000 each compared to amounts shown herein. \n\nThe results of operations described below reflect the operating results of Cantel and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nInterest\nThe stock-based compensation expense recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements may not be representative of the effect of stock-based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years (which level may not be similar in the future), modifications to existing awards, accelerated vesting related to certain employment terminations and assumptions used in determining fair value, expected lives and estimated forfeitures. We determine the fair value of each stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The determination of fair value using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected option life (which is determined by using the historical closing prices of our common stock), the expected dividend yield (which is approximately 0.2%), and the expected option life (which is based on historical exercise behavior).\nFiscal 2015 compared with Fiscal 2014\nThese unfavorable items were offset by the impact of recording acquisition related items consisting of net favorable acquisition related fair value adjustments recorded in general and administrative expenses relating to the Jet Prep Acquisition that were not tax effected due to the structure of the acquisition, partially offset by non-deductible acquisition related charges.\nNone of our sales contain right-of-return provisions. Customer claims for credit or return due to damage, defect, shortage or other reason must be pre-approved by us before credit is issued or such product is accepted for return. No cash discounts for early payment are offered except with respect to a small portion of our product sales in each segment. We do not offer price protection, although advance pricing contracts or required notice periods prior to implementation of price increases exist for certain customers with respect to many of our products. With respect to certain of our dialysis, healthcare disposables, water purification and filtration and endoscopy customers, rebates are provided; such rebates, which consist primarily of volume rebates, are provided for as a reduction of sales at the time of revenue recognition and amounted to $5,944,000, $5,597,000, and $4,498,000 in fiscals 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Such allowances are determined based on estimated projections of sales volume for the entire rebate periods. If it becomes known that sales volume to customers will deviate from original projections, the rebate provisions originally established would be adjusted accordingly.\nWith the exception of fiscal 2016 that had increased sales of low margin concentrate products, which is a product not used in dialyzer reprocessing, sales in our Dialysis segment in recent years have been adversely impacted by the decrease in demand for our sterilants and RENATRON\u00ae reprocessing equipment principally due to the shift from reusable to single-use dialyzers as a result of the declining cost of single-use dialyzers, the ease of using a dialyzer one time, and the commitment of Fresenius Medical Care, the largest dialysis provider chain in the United States and a manufacturer of single-use dialyzers, to convert dialysis clinics performing reuse to single-use facilities. In addition, DaVita, a customer who accounted for approximately 18.0% of net sales in this segment, has converted certain clinics from reuse to single-use and in many cases utilizes single-use when opening new clinics. Based on discussions with customers, we expect the downward trend in reuse dialyzers in the United States to continue during fiscal 2017 and thereafter. A substantial decrease in the market for reprocessing products is likely to result in a significant loss of net sales and a lower level of profitability and operating cash flow in this segment in the future as well as potential future impairments of long-lived assets. Such reduction would also adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. See Risk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nGross Profit\n (v) In December 2015, a law was enacted that included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax, which favorably impacts our gross profit, as more fully described elsewhere in this MD&A. \nWe believe EBITDAS is an important valuation measurement for management and investors given the increasing effect that non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, amortization related to acquisitions and depreciation of capital equipment, has on the Company's net income. In particular, acquisitions have historically resulted in significant increases in amortization of intangible assets that reduce the Company's net income. Additionally, we regard EBITDAS as a useful measure of operating performance and cash flow before the effect of interest expense and is a complement to operating income, net income and other GAAP financial performance measures.\nThe Healthcare Disposables segment's operating income increased by $4,582,000, or 23.0%, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to (i) the inclusion of sales relating to acquisitions, (ii) less amortization expense and (iii) lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by increases to annual salaries and the hiring of additional sales personnel. Excluding amortization expense, and to a much lesser extent acquisition related items, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, the Healthcare Disposables segment's operating income increased by $2,857,000, or 11.6% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015.\n\t\t\nThe Endoscopy segment's operating income increased by $20,158,000, or 49.3%, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to increases in sales in the United States and internationally for our endoscopy products and services, as further explained above, and to a much lesser extent, the inclusion of operating income from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by (i) higher commission expense and other incentive compensation, (ii) increased investment in our sales team and other selling initiatives, (iii) a net unfavorable impact from atypical items, as further described below and within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A and (iv) an increase in annual salaries. Excluding amortization expense as well as atypical items relating to current and prior year acquisition related items and a prior year license impairment, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, the Endoscopy segment's operating income increased by $21,746,000, or 44.4% in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015.\n\t\t\t\nSelling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 14.3% in fiscal 2015 compared with 13.6% in fiscal 2014.\nFor fiscals 2016 and 2015, the realized losses (after tax) would have resulted primarily from (i) increases in the values of the Euro and Canadian dollar relative to the United States dollar and (ii) decreases in the values of the British Pound and Singapore dollar relative to the United States dollar due to the composition of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' financials. However, the use of foreign currency forward contracts would partially offset such realized losses.\nTotal net sales increased by $99,751,000 or 17.7%, to $664,755,000 in fiscal 2016 from $565,004,000 in fiscal 2015. The 17.7% increase in net sales for fiscal 2016 includes (i) an increase of 12.7% in organic sales, (ii) an increase of 5.5% in sales due to acquisitions, partially offset by the divestiture of our specialty packaging business, and (iii) a decrease of 0.5% in net sales due to foreign currency translation.\nSpecialty Packaging\nResearch and development expenses (which include continuing engineering costs) increased by $3,209,000, or 29.7%, to $14,022,000 in fiscal 2015 from $10,813,000 in fiscal 2014 primarily due to additional product development initiatives primarily in our Endoscopy segment, including the inclusion of projects relating to the acquired PuriCore and IMS businesses.\nIn order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the Euro, British Pound and Singapore dollar relative to the United States dollar on the conversion of such net assets into the functional currencies, we enter into short-term contracts to purchase Euros, British Pounds and Singapore dollars forward, which contracts are one-month in duration. These short-term contracts are designated as fair value hedge instruments. There were four foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate value of $7,039,000 at August 31, 2016, which covered certain assets and liabilities that were denominated in currencies other than each entity's functional currency. Such contracts expire on September 30, 2016. These foreign currency forward contracts are continually replaced with new one-month contracts as long as we have significant net assets that are denominated and ultimately settled in currencies other than each entity's functional currency. Gains and losses related to these hedging contracts to buy Euros, British Pounds and Singapore dollars forward are immediately realized within general and administrative expenses due to the short-term nature of such contracts. For fiscal 2016, such forward contracts partially offset the impact on operations related to certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than each entity's functional currency. We do not currently hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar and Chinese Renminbi relative to the United States dollar because the overall foreign currency exposures relating to those currencies are currently not deemed significant. Additionally, we do not hedge transactions associated with the funding of international acquisitions due to the short-term nature of the foreign currency exposure.\nIn addition, we had another operating segment that was divested on April 7, 2015, known as Specialty Packaging, which comprised the Other reporting segment for financial reporting purposes, as further described in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Since the operating results of the Specialty Packaging segment were not significant in relation to our overall consolidated operating results, the divestiture of the business did not have a major effect on our operations and financial results, and accordingly, has not been classified as a discontinued operation for any of the periods presented.\n \u00b7 After adjusting net income for amortization expense and atypical items, non-GAAP net income increased by 21.5% to $72,938,000 from $60,039,000, as further described and reconciled to net income in Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in this MD&A. \nWater Purification and Filtration Segment\nIncome Taxes\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nInterest\nItem 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nResearch and development expense as a percentage of net sales were 2.5% and 2.2% in fiscals 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nBorrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement bear interest at rates ranging from 0.25% to 1.25% above the lender's base rate, or at rates ranging from 1.25% to 2.25% above the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d), depending upon the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio,\u201d which is defined as the consolidated ratio of total funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and as further adjusted under the terms of the 2014 Credit Agreement ( Consolidated EBITDA\u201d). At September 29, 2016, the lender's base rate was 3.50% and the LIBOR rates ranged from 0.52% to 1.33%. The margins applicable to our outstanding borrowings were 0.50% above the lender's base rate or 1.50% above LIBOR. All of our outstanding borrowings were under LIBOR contracts at September 29, 2016. The 2014 Credit Agreement also provides for fees on the unused portion of our facility at rates ranging from 0.20% to 0.40%, depending upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio; such rate was 0.25% at September 29, 2016.\nGeneral Corporate Expenses\nLong-Lived Assets\nIn fiscal 2016, our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in the semi-annual cash dividend to $0.06 per share of outstanding common stock, which was paid on each of January 29, 2016 and July 29, 2016 and totaled $5,005,000.\nOfficer, (ii) the addition of internal and external resources to address various growth initiatives and compliance requirements, (iii) increases in costs associated with our acquisition program and (iv) increases in annual salaries and incentive compensation, including stock-based compensation expense.\n\t\t\t\nof the amount of time that elapses from the point of sale to when the kit is returned to us and we communicate to the customer the results of the required laboratory test. The related cost of the kits is recorded in inventory and recognized in cost of sales as the revenue is earned.\n\t\t\nA reconciliation of the consolidated effective income tax rate for fiscals 2015 and 2014 is as follows:\nThe following table gives information as to the amount of operating income, as well as operating income as a percentage of net sales, for each of our reporting segments.\n\t\t\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nSelling expenses increased by $14,268,000, or 21.5%, to $80,787,000 in fiscal 2015 from $66,519,000 in fiscal 2014 primarily due to (i) increased sales and marketing initiatives to expand into new markets, including international markets, and gain or maintain market share by hiring and training additional sales and marketing personnel and increasing travel budgets in our Endoscopy and Water Purification and Filtration segments and to a lesser extent, our Healthcare Disposables segment, (ii) the inclusion of selling and marketing expenses of DentaPure, PWS, IMS and PuriCore in fiscal 2015, (iii) higher commission expense principally in our Endoscopy segment as a result of higher sales and (iv) increases in annual salaries.\nThe above factors were partially offset by:\nHealthcare Disposables Segment\nby government legislative bodies. We use significant judgment on a quarterly basis in determining our annual effective income tax rate and evaluating our tax positions.\nNet sales of endoscopy products and services increased by $93,098,000, or 37.4%, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015. The 37.4% increase in net sales consist of (i) an increase of 28.0% in organic net sales, (ii) an increase of 10.2% in net sales due to acquisitions and (iii) decrease of 0.8% in net sales due to foreign currency translation. The increase in organic net sales was primarily due to increases in demand in the United States and internationally for our (i) procedure room products (disposable infection control products used in GI endoscopy procedures) due to sales and marketing efforts, (ii) endoscope reprocessing equipment due to our sales and marketing programs and (iii) disinfectants and service due to the increase in the installed base of endoscope reprocessing equipment. We expect sales of disinfectants, service, filters and equipment accessories, most of which carry higher margins, to continue to benefit as we increase the installed base of endoscope reprocessing equipment. These increases were partially offset by overall lower selling prices principally related to endoscopy reprocessing equipment and procedure room products as a result of our strategic growth plan and increased competition.\nOperating Expenses\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn fiscal 2015, our Board of Directors approved an 11.1% increase in the semi-annual cash dividend to $0.05 per share of outstanding common stock, which was paid on each of January 30, 2015 and July 31, 2015 and totaled $4,154,000.\nSelling expenses increased by $18,275,000, or 22.6%, to $99,062,000 in fiscal 2016 from $80,787,000 in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, selling expenses increased primarily due to (i) higher commission expense relating to increased net sales in our Endoscopy segment, (ii) increased sales and marketing initiatives to expand into new markets, including\nTotal net sales increased by $76,255,000, or 15.6%, to $565,004,000 in fiscal 2015 from $488,749,000 in fiscal 2014. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions and the business divestiture, total organic sales increased by $44,179,000, or 9.2%. The increase in organic net sales for fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to increases in net sales of our endoscopy and water purification and filtration products and services and healthcare disposables products, as further described below in Endoscopy Segment,\u201d Water Purification and Filtration Segment\u201d and Healthcare Disposables Segment.\u201d\nHealthcare Disposables Segment\nOverview provides a brief description of our business and a summary of significant activity that has affected or may affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRevenue Recognition\nCertain of our identifiable intangible assets, including customer relationships, technology, brand names, non-compete agreements and patents, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which range from 3 to 20 years. Additionally, we have recorded goodwill and trademarks and trade names, all of which have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not amortized. All of our intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, and goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Our management is responsible for determining if impairment exists and considers a number of factors, including third-party valuations, when making these determinations.\nInterest expense increased by $52,000 to $2,432,000 from $2,380,000 in fiscal 2015, compared with fiscal 2014, as a result of an increase in the average outstanding borrowings due to the funding of acquisitions, partially offset by the recording of an $113,000 charge in fiscal 2014 for the ineffective hedge on our term credit facility and an $84,000 charge in fiscal 2014 to expense the remaining debt issuance costs on our term credit facility, as further explained in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $21,198,000, or 35.9%, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to the increase in net income (after adjusting for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, fair value adjustments of acquisition related liabilities, loss on sale of business, impairment of assets and deferred income taxes) and increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities (due to the timing of payments), partially offset by increases in inventories (due to planned strategic increases in stock levels of certain products primarily in our Endoscopy segment) and accounts receivables (due to strong sales of endoscopy products and services).\nFor purposes of translating the balance sheet at July 31, 2016 compared with July 31, 2015, the total of the foreign currency movements resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $13,019,000 for fiscal 2016, primarily due to the increase in the value of the United States dollar relative to the Euro, Canadian dollar and British Pound, thereby decreasing stockholders' equity.\nAssumed Contingent Liabilities\n (1) Amounts are recorded in general and administrative expenses. \nBusiness Combinations\n\t\t\t\nWith respect to interest rate risk, since our credit facility consists of outstanding debt at prevailing market rates of interest, principally under LIBOR contracts ranging from one to twelve months, our market risk with respect to such debt is the increase in interest expense which would result from higher interest rates associated with LIBOR. Our outstanding debt of $171,000,000 at September 29, 2016 has expected annual interest payments of approximately $3,830,000 using an effective interest rate of 2.24% as described above. Therefore, a 100 basis-point increase in average LIBOR interest rates would result in incremental interest expense of approximately $1,710,000. We monitor our interest rate risk, but presently do not utilize any interest rate derivatives that would mitigate our interest rate exposure. However, all of our outstanding borrowings were under LIBOR contracts at September 29, 2016 that have expiration dates ranging from one to twelve months at fixed interest rates for the contract periods; therefore, we are substantially protected throughout the majority of fiscal 2017 from any significant exposure associated with increasing LIBOR rates, assuming we do not increase our outstanding debt. Additionally, we maintained a cash balance of $28,367,000 at July 31, 2016 which is maintained in cash or invested in low risk and low return cash equivalents such as United States money market funds with leading banking institutions. An increase in interest rates would generate additional interest\nNet sales of dialysis products and services increased by $1,510,000, or 4.8% in fiscal 2016 when compared with fiscal 2015, principally due to (i) an increase in demand for our concentrate product by a single customer, which demand is expected to decline in fiscal 2017, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our sterilant products and RENATRON\u00ae reprocessing equipment due to the market shift from reusable to single-use dialyzers, as further described below.\n\nCash Dividends\nStock compensation expense is recognized for any option or stock award grant based upon the award's fair value. All of our stock options and stock awards (which consist only of restricted stock) are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period, as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period. We recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight-line basis, reduced by estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.\nOverview\nGross profit increased by $55,719,000 or 22.0%, to $309,186,000 in fiscal 2016 from $253,467,000 in fiscal 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2016 and 2015 was 46.5% and 44.9%, respectively. Excluding the impact of acquisition accounting charges, gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2016 and 2015 was 46.7% and 45.2%, respectively.\n\t\t\nThe decrease in the consolidated effective tax rate in fiscal 2016, compared with fiscal 2015, was due to the (i) adverse impact of the divesture of our specialty packaging business in the prior year and (ii) the favorable impact in the current year from the enactment of tax legislation in the United States and internationally, partially offset by higher non-deductible acquisition related items in fiscal 2016, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A. Additionally, the current year consolidated effective tax rate was favorably impacted by improved operating results of our international operations, which are located in lower tax rate jurisdictions. A reconciliation of the consolidated effective income rate for fiscals 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\nOn April 7, 2015, we completed the sale of our Specialty Packaging business to a global packaging and service company, as further described elsewhere in this MD&A and in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overall, this transaction, including costs associated with the disposition and the recognition of a foreign currency translation gain, resulted in a $2,206,000 loss, or $0.04 in diluted earnings per share, which was recorded in loss on sale of business in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Since the divestiture of a business is atypical and non-operating in nature and the loss on sale masks our underlying operating performance, we excluded the loss on sale of business for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures for fiscal 2015.\nWe cannot provide assurances that our gross profit percentage will not be adversely affected in the future (i) by uncertainties associated with our product mix, (ii) by price competition, or (iii) if raw materials and distribution costs increase and we are unable to implement offsetting price increases.\n \u00b7 enhanced profitability in our Healthcare Disposables segment mainly due to (i) increased sales of higher margin products such as sterility assurance and waterline disinfection products, (ii) lower manufacturing costs and (iii) lower amortization expense, partially offset by elevated demand of our face masks and sterility assurance products in the first half of the prior year as a result of (a) customers buying products in advance of certain sales price increases and (b) customer response to the Ebola virus, \nConsolidated Results of Operations\nCompensation Agreements\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n \u00b7 Diluted Earnings Per Share ( EPS\u201d) increased by 25.2% to $1.44 from $1.15. \nGeneral corporate expenses relate to unallocated corporate costs primarily related to executive management personnel, costs associated with certain facets of our acquisition program and being a publicly traded company. Such expenses increased by $2,381,000, or 14.8%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to (i) the addition of internal and external resources to address various growth initiatives and compliance requirements, (ii) costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Financial Officer and recruiting of executive personnel, (iii) increases in costs associated with our acquisition program, and (iv) increases in annual salaries and stock-based compensation.\n \u00b7 Net income under United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) increased by 25.0% to $59,953,000 from $47,953,000. \nGeneral Corporate Expenses\nAcquisitions require significant estimates and judgments related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We determine fair value based on the estimated price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Such initial fair value amounts as well as other acquired assets and liabilities, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, are sometimes refined requiring subsequent adjustments.\nWater Purification and Filtration Segment\nIn December 2015, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 was signed into law and included a two-year moratorium effective January 1, 2016 on the medical device excise tax, which was a tax on medical device manufacturers in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on all U.S. medical device sales. A significant portion of our net sales are considered U.S. medical device sales and therefore our gross profit percentage will continue to be favorably impacted by this moratorium until the two-year moratorium expires. However, we are investing a significant portion of the savings from this moratorium into sales and marketing and product development initiatives.\ninternational markets, and to gain or maintain market share by hiring and training additional sales and marketing personnel and increasing travel budgets in our Endoscopy, Water Purification and Filtration and Healthcare Disposables segments, (iii) the inclusion of selling and marketing expenses of acquisitions, and (iv) increases in annual salaries. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $884,000 in selling expense for fiscal 2016 relating to our specialty packaging business divested in April 2015.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities also include items recorded in conjunction with the purchase accounting for business acquisitions as well as net operating loss carryforwards. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets, as adjusted for valuation allowances, will be realized. Additionally, deferred tax liabilities are regularly reviewed to confirm that such amounts are appropriately stated. A review of our deferred tax items considers known future changes in various income tax rates, principally in the United States. If income tax rates were to change in the future, particularly in the United States and to a lesser extent Canada, the United Kingdom and Italy, our items of deferred tax could be materially affected. All of such evaluations require significant management judgments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n\t\t\nInternational net sales increased by $32,544,000, or 27.8%, to $149,700,000 in fiscal 2016 from $117,156,000 in fiscal 2015. The 27.8% increase in net sales consist of (i) an increase of 12.5% in organic sales, (ii) an increase of 17.5% in net sales due to acquisitions, and (iii) a decrease of 2.2% in net sales due to foreign currency translation.\nThe higher gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2015 and 2014, was primarily attributable to more favorable sales mix due to increases in sales volume of certain products that carry higher gross margin percentages such as our (i) sterilants, filters and procedure products in our Endoscopy segment, (ii) sterilants, filters and certain equipment products in our Water Purification and Filtration segment, and (iii) face masks, disinfectants, sterility assurance products and our acquired DentaPure products in our Healthcare Disposables segment. These items were partially offset by (i) acquisition accounting charges for fiscal 2015 of $1,981,000, relating to fair value adjustments of inventory and deferred revenue acquired in the acquisitions of DentaPure, IMS and PuriCore and (ii) the inclusion in our Endoscopy segment of the PuriCore Acquisition, which had a lower gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisition accounting charges, gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals 2015 and 2014 were 45.2% and 43.6%, respectively.\nCash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities\n\t\t\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\t\t\nRent expense related to operating leases for fiscal 2016 was recorded on a straight-line basis and aggregated $6,675,000, compared with $6,025,000 and $4,409,000 for fiscals 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nRefer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of July 31, 2016.\nNet sales of healthcare disposables products increased by $5,664,000, or 5.3%, in fiscal 2016 when compared with fiscal 2015. The 5.3% increase in net sales consist of (i) increase of 0.3% in organic net sales and (ii) increase of 5.0% in net sales due to acquisitions. Organic net sales for fiscal 2016 were similar to fiscal 2015 as the increase in sales of sterility assurance and waterline disinfection products in the current year were offset by the elevated demand during the first half of the prior year for our face masks and certain sterilization products as a result of (i) customers buying products in advance of certain sales price increases and (ii) customer response to the Ebola virus.\n\t\t\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $19,566,000, or 25.1%, to $97,463,000 in fiscal 2016 from $77,897,000 in fiscal 2015. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to (i) the inclusion of general and administrative expenses of our acquisitions, (ii) the impact of atypical items relating to acquisitions and costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Executive Officer, partially offset by the prior year impairment of an acquired license, as further described below and within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, and (iii) increases in annual salaries and incentive compensation including stock-based compensation.\n (i) Some of our key financial results for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 were as follows: \nMinimum commitments under operating leases include minimum rental commitments for our leased manufacturing facilities, warehouses, office space and equipment.\nNet sales of water purification and filtration products and services increased by $3,835,000, or 2.2%, in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015. The 2.2% increase in net sales consist of (i) an increase of 1.0% in organic net sales, (ii) an increase of 1.6% in net sales due to acquisitions and (iii) decrease of 0.4% in net sales due to foreign currency translation. The increase in organic net sales was primarily due to an increase in demand for our (i) sterilants products, (ii) service and (iii) water purification equipment used for commercial and industrial (large capital) applications.\n\t\t\nThe reconciliations of diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS were calculated as follows:\nResearch and development expenses (which include continuing engineering costs) increased by $1,388,000, or 9.9%, to $15,410,000 in fiscal 2016 from $14,022,000 in fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to additional product development initiatives primarily in our Endoscopy segment, including the inclusion of projects relating to recent acquisitions.\nResults of Operations\nCredit Facility and Interest Rate Market Risk\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNet sales of water purification and filtration products and services increased by $14,329,000, or 8.9%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily attributable to (i) higher sales of our capital equipment, consumables and service in the dialysis industry mainly attributable to our expanding service network as well as the increased overall demand driven by the growing number of dialysis patients and clinics in the United States and the increasing market acceptance of the disinfection efficacy and cost benefits of our heat sanitized water purification systems, which carry higher average selling prices than the systems with the traditional non-heated sanitization and to a much lesser extent (ii) the inclusion of net sales generated by the PWS Acquisition. Excluding net sales relating to the PWS Acquisition, organic net sales in our Water Purification and Filtration segment increased by 6.8% for fiscal 2015.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nTax legislation was enacted in the United States and internationally that enabled us to record favorable tax benefits in our second quarter of fiscal 2016 relating to the entire calendar 2015. Since these favorable tax benefits are largely unrelated to our current year's income before taxes and is unrepresentative of our normal effective tax rate, we excluded its impact on net income and EPS for fiscal 2016 for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current performance and a comparison to past performance.\n\t\t\t\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\nChanges in the value of the Euro, British Pound, Singapore dollar, Canadian dollar and the Chinese Renminbi against the United States dollar affect our results of operations because certain cash bank accounts, accounts receivable and liabilities of Cantel and its subsidiaries are denominated and ultimately settled in United States dollars or these foreign currencies, but must be converted into each entity's functional currency. Furthermore, the financial statements of most of our international subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and therefore are impacted by changes in the international entities' functional currency relative to the United States dollar.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDAS as EBITDAS excluding the same atypical items as previously described as adjustments to net income. We use Adjusted EBITDAS when evaluating the operating performance of the Company because we believe the exclusion of such atypical items, of which a significant portion are non-cash items, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of on-going core operating results and to evaluate comparative results period over period.\nLong-Term Contractual Obligations\n\t\t\t\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nIn fiscal 2014, our Board of Directors approved a 22.0% increase in the semi-annual cash dividend to $0.045 per share of outstanding common stock, which was paid on each of January 31, 2014 and July 31, 2014 and totaled $3,721,000.\nThe Dialysis segment's operating income decreased by $798,000, or 10.6%, in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily due to a decrease in demand for our sterilant product and RENATRON\u00ae dialyzer reprocessing equipment, partially offset by an increase in demand for our low margin concentrate product. See Risk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIncome Taxes\nThe consolidated effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 was adversely affected by initial operating losses of our international operations located in lower tax rate jurisdictions, as well as the $2,206,000 loss on sale of our Specialty Packaging business, as further described elsewhere in this MD&A and in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to the inability to currently deduct a capital loss and the uncertainty of utilizing a capital loss tax benefit in the future, a tax benefit was not recognized on a portion of the loss on sale of the Specialty Packaging business, thereby increasing our consolidated effective tax rate.\nAcquisition related items consist of (i) fair value adjustments to contingent consideration and other contingent liabilities resulting from acquisitions, (ii) due diligence, integration, legal fees and other transaction costs associated with our acquisition program and (iii) acquisition accounting charges for the amortization of the initial fair value adjustments of acquired inventory and deferred revenue. The adjustments of contingent consideration and other contingent liabilities are periodic adjustments to record such amounts at fair value at each balance sheet date. Given the subjective nature of the assumptions used in the determination of fair value calculations, fair value adjustments may potentially cause significant earnings volatility that are not representative of our operating results. Similarly, due diligence, integration, legal and other acquisition costs associated with our acquisition program, including acquisition accounting charges relating to recording acquired inventory and deferred revenue at fair market value, can be significant and also adversely impact our effective tax rate as certain costs are often not tax-deductible. Since all of these acquisition related items are atypical and often mask underlying operating performance, we excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to past operating performance.\n \u00b7 Endoscopy: Medical device reprocessing systems, disinfectants, detergents and other supplies used to high-level disinfect rigid endoscopes, flexible endoscopes and other instrumentation and disposable infection control products intended to reduce the challenges associated with proper cleaning and high-level disinfection of numerous reusable components used in gastrointestinal ( GI\u201d) endoscopy procedures, pulmonary endoscopy and other procedures that require the reprocessing of medical equipment. In September 2015, this segment commenced the sale of endoscope transport and storage systems, and a number of endoscopy consumable accessories. Additionally, this segment includes technical maintenance service on its products. \nThe reconciliations of net income to EBITDAS and Adjusted EBITDAS were calculated as follows:\n \u00b7 the impact of atypical items relating to acquisitions and costs associated with the retirement of our Chief Executive Officer, partially offset by the prior year atypical items, as further described within Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere in this MD&A, and \nResults of Operations provides a discussion of the consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014.\nInterest income increased by $20,000 to $88,000 in fiscal 2016 from $68,000 in fiscal 2015.\n \u00b7 Healthcare Disposables: Single-use, infection prevention and control healthcare products including face masks, sterilization pouches, towels and bibs, tray covers, saliva ejectors, plastic cups, germicidal wipes and disinfectants, as well as a product for maintaining safe dental unit waterlines. This segment also manufactures and sells biological and chemical indicators for sterility assurance monitoring services in the acute-care, alternate-care, dental and industrial (medical device, life science and other manufacturers) markets. In August 2016, this segment commenced the manufacture and sale of nitrous oxide conscious sedation equipment and related single-use disposables. \n (vi) On October 16, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in the semi-annual cash dividend to $0.06 per share of outstanding common stock, which was paid on each of January 29, 2016 and July 29, 2016, as more fully described elsewhere in this MD&A.
