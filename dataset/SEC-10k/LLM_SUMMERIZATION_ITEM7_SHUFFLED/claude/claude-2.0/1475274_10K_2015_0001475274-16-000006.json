Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d\nWe operate a leading digital savings destination connecting consumers with retailers, restaurants and brands, both online and in-store. In the year ended December 31, 2015, our marketplace featured digital offers from over 70,000 retailers and brands, and we had contracts with more than 12,000 retailers. According to our internal data compiled using Google Analytics, we had approximately 718 million total visits to our desktop and mobile websites. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we averaged approximately 23.2 million mobile unique visitors per month.\nWe derive the substantial majority of our net revenues from retailers, restaurants or brands that pay us directly or through third-party performance marketing networks. A retailer is a merchant that sells goods or services directly to consumers. A paid retailer is a retailer, restaurant or brand that has contracted to pay us a commission for sales which we influence using digital offers made available in our marketplace and/or a retailer, restaurant or brand that we have a contract with to pay us to promote their digital offers or provide advertising in our marketplace. In some instances, the paid retailer itself provides affiliate tracking links for attribution of online sales using digital offers made available in our marketplace and pays us directly. However, in most cases, paid retailers contract with performance marketing networks to provide affiliate tracking links for attribution of online sales using digital offers made available in our marketplace. These paid retailers then pay the commissions we earn to the performance marketing network, which in turn pays those commissions to us. In general, our contracts with performance marketing networks govern our use of affiliate tracking links made available to us by the performance marketing network and the remittance of any commissions payable to us from paid retailers utilizing the performance marketing network. The performance marketing network with which a paid retailer contracts to provide affiliate tracking links provides us with the paid retailer's contract terms, which must be accepted by us and the paid retailer, and which further govern our use of affiliate tracking links for such paid retailer and payment of commissions to us. Our contracts are generally short term, meaning that they can be canceled by any of the contracting parties on 30 days' notice or less.\nIn 2015, the substantial majority of our net revenues were derived from commissions earned when consumers made purchases using digital offers featured on our websites and mobile applications. We expect that a majority of our net revenues in the future will continue to be derived from these commissions. Commission rates are determined through negotiations with retailers based on a variety of factors, including the level of exposure to consumers in our marketplace, the quality and volume of sales realized from consumers using digital offers from our marketplace and the category of products purchased using digital offers. We sell our solutions to retailers, restaurants and brands through a direct sales force.\nDuring 2015 we generated net revenues of $249.1 million, a decrease of 5.9% from $264.7 million in 2014. Net income for 2015 was $11.8 million, a 56.1% decrease from $27.0 million in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was $71.9 million, a 23.4% decrease from $93.9 million in 2014. See Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data,\u201d page 43, for further discussion of adjusted EBITDA, our use of this measure, the limitations of this measure as an analytical tool, and the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nIn August 2015, we announced a plan to reduce operating expenses in order to realign our cost structure with our current strategic plan. As part of this expense reduction, we reduced U.S. headcount by approximately 10%. We incurred approximately $1.2 million in severance costs associated with the targeted employee reductions, which were included in the results of our operations for 2015.\nWe were formed in 2007 and began our operations as a marketplace for digital offers in November 2009 with the acquisitions of the businesses of Deals2Buy.com, Coupon7.com, Couponshare.com and CheapStingyBargains.com. In November 2010, we acquired the business of RetailMeNot.com. In August 2011, we acquired the business of VoucherCodes.co.uk, expanding our operations into the U.K. In April 2012, we acquired the businesses of Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com, expanding our operations into France. In March 2013, we acquired the business of Actiepagina.nl, expanding our operations into the Netherlands. In July 2013, we acquired the business of Ma-Reduc.com, expanding our existing operations in France. In October 2013, we acquired the business and associated offer validation technology of YSL Ventures, Inc., which operated under the name Zendeals. Our net revenues for 2013 include the revenues of Actiepagina.nl, Ma-Reduc.com and YSL Ventures, Inc. for the period from the respective acquisition dates through December 31, 2013.\nOur acquisitions have required us to integrate new operations, offices and employees and to formulate and execute on marketing, product, sales, content and technology strategies associated with the acquired businesses. We continue to manage multiple brands and certain of the technology platforms of the acquired businesses, which has increased our cost of operations.\nWe believe that featuring desirable digital offers is necessary to attract visitors to our marketplace, which includes our websites, mobile applications, email, mobile alerts and social media distribution channels. In addition to increasing the number of visitors to our marketplace, we are focused on increasing the rate and frequency at which these visitors make purchases from retailers whose digital offers are featured in our marketplace. To meet these challenges, we are focused on a combination of marketing strategies, including pay-per-click advertising, search engine optimization, branding campaigns and email and mobile alerts, with a goal of driving visits to our marketplace as well as increasing the exposure of the digital offer category. We are also investing in product enhancements to make it easier for consumers visiting our marketplace to search and find the right digital offers and in expanding the types of digital offers available to consumers on our marketplace. We believe these enhancements will increase consumers' interactions with retailers in our marketplace, which will in turn increase the value we are able to provide to our paid retailers.\nWe intend to achieve future success by continuing to focus on improving the monetization of our mobile websites and mobile applications. Since the launch of our mobile websites and mobile applications, traffic to these properties has increased significantly. However, mobile traffic generally monetizes at a lower rate than desktop traffic. We believe the comparatively lower rate of monetization primarily results from the following: (1) mobile visits tend to be more exploratory in nature, due to lower purchase intent than desktop visits, difficulties in navigating from our mobile websites and applications to retailer websites and friction in the purchase process on retailers' mobile websites, (2) we do not receive sales commissions or attribution when consumers that visit our websites and mobile applications using a mobile device subsequently make a purchase by directly accessing a retailer's website on another device, such as a desktop or tablet or in-store (a circumstance known as cross device switching) and (3) some retailers currently do not recognize affiliate tracking links on their mobile websites or applications, and the tracking mechanisms related to such may not function to allow proper attribution of sales to us. We intend to introduce new methods of monetizing our consumer traffic, particularly the traffic to our mobile websites and applications, through a variety of methods, including improved attribution to us of the sales that we help drive for our retail and brand partners, the use of pricing structures other than our traditional commission-based model (particularly with respect to advertising) and the use of multichannel digital offer solutions.\nWe also intend to enhance the monetization of our websites and mobile applications by making product improvements that appeal to both consumers and retailers. These enhancements include increased leveraging of data to better personalize digital offers for consumers and to be a more effective channel for paid retailers to leverage our audience of users; further developing the location-based services features on our mobile applications to provide more geographically relevant digital offers; expanding food and dining content, which we believe consumers use on a more frequent basis; and continuing to invest in product functionality that encourages engagement of our community of users.\nWe also believe that recruiting, training and retaining talented employees and strengthening our direct relationships with consumers and retailers will be critical to our future success. We aim to further strengthen our value proposition for both consumers and retailers by scaling our expanded range of offer types. For example, we now offer sponsored category listings, more advertising opportunities and digital circulars and showcases to retailers and discounted digital gift cards and digital rebates to consumers.\nFinally, we also plan to improve the consistency and reliability of our marketplace by continuing to invest in the development and implementation of certain universal software platforms to support our international websites. We believe this investment has allowed, and will allow in the future, us to more easily and rapidly expand organically in new geographic markets and integrate the systems of any additional digital offering businesses which we may acquire and should result in increased operational efficiency.\nWe believe that these significant investments in our product, team, relationships and technology will enable our expansion into new markets and improve the quality, consistency and monetization of our marketplace.\nKey Financial and Operating Metrics\nWe measure our business using both financial and operating metrics. We use these metrics to assess the progress of our business, make decisions on where to allocate capital, time and technology investments, and assess the longer-term performance of our business. The key financial and operating metrics we use are as follows:\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except net revenues per visit)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Metrics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Online transaction net revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Desktop online transaction net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mobile online transaction net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total online transaction net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>198,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising and in-store net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>264,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Metrics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Visits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Desktop visits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>420,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>499,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>459,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mobile visits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total visits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>718,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>697,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>560,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Online transaction net revenues per visit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Desktop online transaction net revenues per visit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mobile online transaction net revenues per visit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total online transaction net revenues per visit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mobile unique visitors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Metrics\nDesktop Online Transaction Net Revenues. We define desktop online transaction net revenues as amounts paid to us by paid retailers, either directly or through performance marketing networks, in the form of commissions for completed online transactions on desktop computers and tablet devices. In general, we earn a commission from a paid retailer when a consumer clicks on a digital offer for that paid retailer on one of our websites or tablet applications and then makes an online purchase from that paid retailer.\nMobile Online Transaction Net Revenues. We define mobile online transaction net revenues as amounts paid to us by paid retailers, either directly or through performance marketing networks, in the form of commissions for completed online transactions on smartphones and other mobile devices. In general, we earn a commission from a paid retailer when a consumer clicks on a digital offer for that paid retailer on one of our websites or mobile applications and then makes an online purchase from that paid retailer.\nOnline Transaction Net Revenues. We define online transaction net revenues as the total of our desktop online transaction net revenues and our mobile online transaction net revenues.\nAdvertising and In-store Net Revenues. We define advertising net revenues collectively as amounts paid to us by paid retailers for displaying digital offers that may be redeemed on one of our websites, as well as amounts paid to us by paid retailers for providing advertising of the retailer's brand or products in our marketplace. We define in-store net revenues collectively as commission amounts earned from paid retailers when a consumer presents a digital offer to the retailer and the digital offer is scanned or a unique digital offer code is entered by the retailer at the point of sale, as well as other amounts paid to us by paid retailers for displaying digital offers on our websites and mobile applications that may be redeemed in-store.\nNet Revenues. We define net revenues as the total of our online transaction net revenues and our advertising and in-store net revenues. We believe net revenues are an important indicator for our business because they are a reflection of the value we offer to consumers and retailers through our marketplace.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define this metric as net income plus depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, third party acquisition-related costs, other non-cash operating expenses (including asset impairment charges and compensation arrangements entered into in connection with acquisitions), net interest expense, other non-operating income and expenses and income taxes, net of any foreign exchange income or expenses. We believe that the use of adjusted EBITDA is helpful in evaluating our operating performance because it excludes certain non-cash expenses, including depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense. See page 42 in Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data\u201d for additional discussion of adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nOperating Metrics\nDesktop Visits. We define a desktop visit as an interaction or group of interactions that takes place on one of our websites from desktop computers and tablet devices within a given time frame as measured by Google Analytics, a product that provides digital marketing intelligence. A single visit can contain multiple page views, events, social interactions, custom variables, and e-commerce transactions. A single visitor can open multiple visits. Visits can occur on the same day, or over several days, weeks, or months. As soon as one visit ends, there is then an opportunity to start a new visit. A visit ends either through the passage of time or a campaign change, with a campaign generally meaning arrival via search engine, referring site, or campaign-tagged information. A visit ends through passage of time either after 30 minutes of inactivity or at midnight Pacific Time. A visit ends through a campaign change if a visitor arrives via one campaign or source, leaves the site, and then returns via another campaign or source. Currently, visits do not include interactions on our tablet applications.\nMobile Visits. We define a mobile visit as an interaction or group of interactions that takes place on one of our mobile websites from smartphones and other mobile devices within a given time frame as measured by Google Analytics, a product that provides digital marketing intelligence. A single visit can contain multiple page views, events, social interactions, custom variables, and e-commerce transactions. A single visitor can open multiple visits. Visits can occur on the same day, or over several days, weeks, or months. As soon as one visit ends, there is then an opportunity to start a new visit. A visit ends either through the passage of time or a campaign change, with a campaign generally meaning arrival via search engine, referring site, or campaign-tagged information. A visit ends through passage of time either after 30 minutes of inactivity or at midnight Pacific Time. A visit ends through a campaign change if a visitor arrives via one campaign or source, leaves the site, and then returns via another campaign or source. Currently, mobile visits do not include interactions on our mobile applications.\nVisits. We define visits as the total of our desktop visits and mobile visits. We view visits to our websites as a key indicator of our brand awareness among consumers and whether we are providing consumers with useful products and features, thereby increasing their usage of our marketplace. We believe that a higher level of usage may contribute to an increase in our net revenues and exclusive digital offers as retailers will have exposure to a larger potential customer base.\nDesktop Online Transaction Net Revenues per Visit. We define desktop online transaction net revenues per visit as desktop online transaction net revenues for the period divided by desktop visits for the period.\nMobile Online Transaction Net Revenues per Visit. We define mobile online transaction net revenues per visit as mobile online transaction net revenues for the period divided by mobile visits for the period.\nOnline Transaction Net Revenues per Visit. We define online transaction net revenues per visit as online transaction net revenues for the period divided by visits for the period.\nMobile Unique Visitors. This amount represents the average number of monthly mobile unique visitors for the last three months of the period. We define each of the following as a mobile unique visitor: (i) the first time a specific mobile device accesses one of our mobile applications during a calendar month, and (ii) the first time a specific mobile device accesses one of our mobile websites using a specific web browser during a calendar month. If a mobile device accesses more than one of our mobile websites or mobile applications in a single calendar month, the first access to each such mobile website or mobile application is counted as a mobile unique visitor, as they are tracked separately for each mobile domain. We measure mobile unique visitors with a combination of internal data sources and Google Analytics data.\nWe view mobile unique visitors as a key indicator of the size of our mobile audience as well as our brand awareness among consumers and usage of our mobile solutions which we expect to be important as users increasingly rely on their mobile devices.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nNet Revenues\nThe substantial majority of our net revenues consist of commissions we receive from paid retailers, either directly or through performance marketing networks. In general, we earn commissions from a paid retailer when a consumer makes a purchase online from that paid retailer after clicking on a digital offer for that paid retailer on one of our websites or mobile applications. We also earn revenues from our in-store product, which include commissions earned from a retailer when a consumer presents a digital offer to the retailer in-store and the digital offer is scanned or a unique digital offer code is entered by the retailer at the point of sale, and amounts paid to us by retailers for displaying digital offers that may be redeemed in-store on our websites or mobile applications. We provide performance marketing solutions under contracts with retailers, which generally provide for commission payments to be facilitated by performance marketing networks. Commission rates are typically negotiated with individual retailers with which we have contracts. Our commission rates vary based on a variety of factors, including the retailer, the level of exposure to consumers in our marketplace, the quality and volume of sales realized from consumers using digital offers in our marketplace and the category of products purchased using digital offers. We recognize commission revenues when we receive confirmation that a consumer has completed a purchase transaction with a paid retailer, as reported to us through a performance marketing network, or in some cases, by the retailer directly. When a digital offer applies only to specific items, the discount to the consumer will be applied only to those specific items, but our commission is generally based on the aggregate purchase price of all items purchased at that time by the consumer. Finally, we also earn advertising revenues from advertising in our marketplace. Rates for advertising are typically negotiated with individual retailers with which we have contracts. Payments for advertising may be made directly by retailers or through performance marketing networks. We expect that the majority of our net revenues in the future will continue to be derived from commissions. Commission revenues are reported net of a reserve for estimated returns. We estimate returns based on our actual historical returns experience. These returns have not been significant.\nCosts and Expenses\nWe classify our costs and expenses into six categories: cost of net revenues, product development, sales and marketing, general and administrative, amortization of purchased intangible assets and other operating expenses. We allocate our personnel, facilities and general information technology, or IT, costs, which include IT and facilities-related personnel costs, rent, depreciation and other general costs, to all of the above categories of operating expenses, other than amortization of purchased intangibles and other operating expenses.\nWe expect personnel costs will be higher in 2016, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues, when compared to 2015 as a result of our plan to increase personnel in 2016 as we continue to invest in our business. Personnel costs for employees include salaries and amounts earned under variable compensation plans, payroll taxes, benefits, stock-based compensation expense, costs associated with recruiting new employees, travel costs and other employee-related costs.\nCost of Net Revenues\nOur cost of net revenues consists of direct and indirect costs incurred to generate net revenues. These costs consist primarily of personnel costs of our merchandising, site operations and website technical support employees; fees paid to third-party contractors engaged in the operation and maintenance of our websites and mobile applications; depreciation; and website hosting and Internet service costs. We expect our cost of net revenues to increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2016 as we continue to build our infrastructure to support our business across multiple markets, endeavor to improve offer diversity and quality and increase the number and amount of consumer purchases resulting from visits to our websites and from use of our mobile applications.\nProduct Development\nOur product development expense consists primarily of personnel costs of our product management and software engineering teams, as well as fees paid to third-party contractors and consultants engaged in the design, development, testing and improvement of the functionality and user experience of our websites and mobile applications. We intend to continue to increase our software engineering resources over the next year by hiring additional personnel to develop new features and products for our websites and mobile applications. We expect these additional investments to cause our product development expense to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2016.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs of our sales, marketing, SEO and business analytics employees, as well as online and other advertising expenditures, branding programs and other marketing expenses. Our advertising, branding programs and other marketing costs include paid search advertising fees, online display advertising, including on social networking sites, television advertising, creative development fees, public relations, email campaigns, trade show costs, sweepstakes and promotions and other general marketing costs. We intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in 2016 to drive consumer traffic to our websites, encourage downloads of our mobile applications, strengthen our relationships with retailers and increase overall awareness of our brand. Therefore, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expense consists primarily of the personnel costs of our general corporate functions, including executive, finance, accounting, legal and human resources. Other costs included in general and administrative include professional fees for legal, audit and other consulting services, travel and entertainment, charitable contributions, provision for doubtful accounts receivable and other general corporate overhead expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2016.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles\nWe have recorded identifiable intangible assets in conjunction with our various acquisitions, and are amortizing those assets over their estimated useful lives. We perform impairment testing of goodwill annually on October 1 of each year and, in the case of intangibles with definite lives, whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We expect our amortization expenses to decline in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2016. However, changes in our amortization expenses will depend upon the level of our future acquisition activity.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses for 2015 consist primarily of amortization expense related to deferred compensation agreements with the selling stockholders of YSL Ventures, Inc. and expense recognized as a result of the identified impairment of purchased intangible assets associated with Bons-de-Reduction.com.\nIn 2013, we acquired YSL Ventures, Inc. and entered into $6.2 million in deferred compensation agreements with the selling stockholders of the business, $3.1 million of which was paid in October 2014 and the remaining $3.1 million of which was paid in equal quarterly installments over the following year, concluding in October 2015. The deferred compensation was due and payable contingent upon the continued employment of the selling stockholders and as a result we amortized the associated expense over the term of the compensation arrangement with the sellers.\nIn October 2015, we decided to no longer support the Bons-de-Reduction.com brand. We have redirected traffic from Bons-de-Reduction.com to Poulpeo.com, and do not expect Bons-de-Reduction.com to provide additional income. As a result, we determined that a complete impairment of the remaining unamortized intangible assets associated with Bons-de-Reduction was warranted, resulting in an impairment charge of $2.3 million.\nOther operating expenses for 2014 and 2013 consist primarily of amortization expense related to deferred compensation agreements with the selling stockholders of YSL Ventures, Inc. and Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com. In 2012, we acquired Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com and issued $3.5 million in seller notes to the selling stockholders of the business. These seller notes were due and payable contingent upon the continued employment of the selling stockholders and as a result have been recorded as deferred compensation, which we amortized over the term of the compensation arrangement with the sellers, which was completed in May 2014.\nWe expect other operating expenses to decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2016 as a result of the completion during 2015 of our deferred compensation agreement with the selling stockholders of YSL Ventures, Inc.\nOther Income (Expense)\nAmounts included in other income (expense) include interest income earned on our available cash and cash equivalents, interest expense incurred in connection with our long term debt and the amortization of deferred financing costs. We also include in other income (expense), net foreign currency exchange gains and losses, as well as gains and losses related to our\nforeign exchange derivative instruments. Changes in these amounts will depend to some extent upon the level of our future borrowing activity and movements in foreign currency.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in those jurisdictions, tax credits, state taxes and non-deductible expenses, such as deferred compensation, acquisition costs and stock-based compensation. Our mix of foreign versus U.S. income, our ability to generate tax credits and our incurrence of any non-deductible expenses will likely cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate in the future. Our effective tax rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.\nDuring the first quarter of 2014, we implemented a global corporate restructuring plan involving our non-U.S. entities to streamline our non-U.S. operations. The impact of this restructuring has resulted in, and may continue to result in, volatility in our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities, net revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below.\nWe also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements.\u201d Of those policies, we believe that the accounting policies discussed below involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of judgment by our management. We evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions on an ongoing basis, and while we believe that our estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.\nBusiness Combinations and the Recoverability of Goodwill and Long-Lived Intangible Assets\nA significant component of our growth strategy has been to acquire and integrate businesses that complement our existing operations. Though we did not acquire any businesses during 2015, we expect to do so in the future. We account for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting and allocate the purchase price of each acquired business to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair value at the purchase date. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nIn determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, we use recognized valuation methods, including the income approach, market approach and cost approach, and apply present value modeling. Our significant estimates in the income, market or cost approach include identifying business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable net revenues and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value. We also make certain assumptions specific to present value modeling valuation techniques which include risk-adjusted discount rates, future commission rates, rates of increase in operating expenses, weighted-average cost of capital, long-term growth rate assumptions and the future effective income tax rates.\nMost of the businesses we have acquired did not have a significant amount of tangible assets. As a result, our acquisitions have resulted in the majority of the purchase price being allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. The long-lived intangible assets we have identified in each acquisition include customer relationships and marketing-related, contract-related and technology-based intangible assets. All of our long-lived intangible assets have a definite life that ranges from one year to 15 years, which we have determined reflects our best estimate of the pattern in which the economic benefit of the related intangible asset will be utilized.\nThe valuations of our acquired businesses have been performed by valuation specialists under our management's supervision. We believe that the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. However, such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ from those estimates. Future changes in our assumptions or the interrelationship of those assumptions may negatively impact future valuations. In future measurements of fair value, adverse changes in discounted cash flow assumptions could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets that would require a non-cash charge to the consolidated statements of operations and may have a material effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe perform our annual impairment testing of goodwill as of October 1 of each year, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, significant changes in competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment process tested at the reporting segment level. In the first step, the fair value for our reporting unit is compared to our book value including goodwill. For purposes of performing the required impairment test, we derive enterprise fair value utilizing the market capitalization approach, whereby the market value of our outstanding shares of common stock are utilized to calculate the fair value of our sole reporting unit. In the case that the fair value is less than the book value, a second step is performed that compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the book value of the goodwill. The fair value for the implied goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the sole reporting segment and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities excluding goodwill. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations.\nLong-lived assets, including intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. When such events occur, we compare the carrying amounts of the assets to their undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates that there is impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and fair value.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the fee to our customers is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. For commission revenues, which represent the substantial majority of our net revenues, revenue recognition generally occurs when a consumer, having visited one of our websites and clicked on a digital offer for a paid retailer, makes a purchase with such paid retailer, and completion of the order is reported to us by such paid retailer, either directly or through a performance marketing network. Certain paid retailers do not provide reporting until a cash payment is made. In those cases, which have historically not been significant, we record commission revenues on a cash basis. For advertising revenues, revenue recognition occurs over the period that we display a retailer's advertisements on our websites and mobile applications.\nMultiple Element Arrangements. When we enter into revenue arrangements with customers that are comprised of multiple deliverables, we allocate consideration to all deliverables based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy. The objective of the hierarchy is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a stand-alone basis and requires the use of: (1) vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, if available; (2) third-party evidence, or TPE, if VSOE is not available; and (3) best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\nVSOE. We determine VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the stand-alone selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. We have not historically sold our services within a reasonably narrow pricing range. As a result, we have not been able to establish VSOE.\nTPE. When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of services cannot be obtained. Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor services' selling prices are on a stand-alone basis. As a result, we have not been able to establish selling price based on TPE.\nBESP. When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a stand-alone basis. BESP is generally used to allocate the selling price to deliverables in our multiple element arrangements. We determine BESP for deliverables by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, prices we charge for similar offerings, market conditions, competitive landscape and pricing practices. We limit the amount of allocable arrangement consideration to amounts that are fixed or determinable and that are not contingent on future performance or future deliverables.\nIf the facts and circumstances underlying the factors we considered change or should future facts and circumstances lead us to consider additional factors, both our determination of our relative selling price under the hierarchy and our BESPs could change in future periods.\nWe estimate and record a reserve based upon actual, historical return rates as reported to us by paid retailers to provide for end-user cancelations or product returns, which may not be reported by the paid retailer or performance marketing network until a subsequent date. As such, we report commission revenues net of the estimated returns reserve. Net revenues are reported net of sales taxes, where applicable.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rate could be affected by differences between our anticipated and the actual mix of earnings generated across different tax jurisdictions which have higher or lower statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations.\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed or settled. We regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Any change in the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. ASC 740 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits.\nWe record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.\nWe are subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nWe consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability related to the U.S. federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes of our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the U.S. Should we decide to repatriate our foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that those earnings would no longer be indefinitely invested outside the U.S.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based compensation expense at fair value and generally recognize the corresponding compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the service period during which awards are expected to vest. Forfeiture rates are estimated periodically based on historical experience and adjusted in subsequent periods for differences in actual forfeitures from those estimates.\nWe use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimates of a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include:\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Fair Value of Our Common Stock. Because our stock was not publicly traded prior to our offering in July 2013, the fair value of our common stock underlying our stock options was previously determined by our board of directors, which intended all options to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant. Following the completion of our initial public offering our common stock is being valued by reference to its publicly traded price.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected Term.

We did not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers' common stock because the volume of activity was relatively low. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our Series 1 common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Dividend Yield.

Our obligations to pay the outstanding amounts under these deferred compensation arrangements were contingent upon the continued employment of the selling stockholders and, as a result, have been recorded as deferred compensation, which we amortized over the term of the compensation arrangements with the sellers.

Historically, we have experienced the highest levels of visitors to our websites and mobile applications and net revenues in the fourth quarter of the year, which coincides with the winter holiday season in the U.S. and Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we generated net revenues of $83.1 million which represented 33.4% of our net revenues for 2015. This seasonality may not be fully evident in our historical business performance because of our significant growth in prior years and the timing of our acquisitions. For instance, we have entered new markets through international acquisitions and increased the number of paid retailer and performance marketing network relationships. These changes have contributed to the substantial growth in our net revenues and corresponding increases in our operating costs and expenses to support our growth. Further, net revenues from our advertising and in-store products are even more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter of the year. As net revenues from this part of our business grow as a percentage of overall net revenues, for example to 20.4% from 11.1% of overall net revenues for 2015 and 2014, respectively, our seasonality may increase.\nOur investments have led to uneven quarterly operating results due to increases in personnel costs, product and technology enhancements and the impact of our acquisitions and other strategic projects. The return on these investments is generally achieved in future periods and, as a result, these investments can adversely impact near term results.\nOur business is directly affected by the behavior of consumers. Economic conditions and competitive pressures can impact, both positively and negatively, the types of digital offers featured on our websites and mobile applications and the rates at which consumers utilize them. Consequently, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have funded our operations and acquisitions primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, the issuance of equity securities through our initial public offering and follow-on offering, bank borrowings and cash flows from operations. We generated positive cash flow from operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. As of December 31, 2015, we had $259.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $244.5 million at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, certain of our foreign subsidiaries held approximately $16.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents. If these assets were distributed to the U.S., we might be subject to additional U.S. taxes in certain circumstances, subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits, and foreign withholding taxes.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $60.5 million, $61.4 million and $31.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nDuring 2015, cash flows from operating activities were primarily generated through net income of $11.8 million, including the impact of depreciation and amortization expense of $17.1 million, stock-based compensation expense of $26.9 million, intangible asset impairment expense of $2.3 million and the amortization of deferred compensation of $2.3 million.\nDuring 2014, cash flows from operating activities were primarily generated through net income of $27.0 million, including the impact of depreciation and amortization expense of $15.7 million, stock-based compensation expense of $24.5 million and the amortization of deferred compensation of $4.0 million, offset by excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensation and other costs of $12.2 million and a deferred income tax benefit of $4.2 million.\nDuring 2013, cash flows from operating activities were primarily generated through net income of $31.5 million, including the impact of depreciation and amortization expense of $14.1 million and stock-based compensation expense of $10.5 million, offset by $23.6 million from changes in cash flows associated with operating assets and liabilities. The changes in cash flows associated with operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable of $25.7 million due to our net revenues growth.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nOur primary investing activities for the periods presented consist of purchases of property and equipment and other assets, the purchase of a non-marketable investment and business acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities was $19.2 million, $13.0 million and $36.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nDuring 2015, 2014 and 2013, we used $15.2 million, $13.0 million and $8.3 million, respectively, related to the purchase of computer equipment and software, office furniture and fixtures, leasehold improvements, certain capitalized internally developed software and website development costs and domain names. As we expand our business, we intend to purchase additional technology resources and invest in our operating facilities.\nDuring 2015, we used $4.0 million to invest in a non-controlling minority ownership stake in a privately-held marketing technology company in the United States.\nDuring 2013, we used $11.4 million to acquire the business of YSL Ventures, Inc., $15.3 million to acquire the business of Ma-Reduc.com and $1.9 million to acquire the business of Actiepagina.nl in 2013. We may have acquisitions in the future that could have a material impact on our cash flows and operations.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nOur primary financing activities for the periods presented consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock, proceeds from and repayments of our long term debt, the repurchase of our Series 1 common stock and share based payment activity. Net cash used in financing activities was $24.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash provided by financing activities was $31.4 million and $73.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nDuring 2015, we borrowed $30.0 million under our revolving credit facility. We used $52.9 million of our cash to repurchase our Series 1 common stock. The remainder of our financing activities was primarily composed of proceeds from the issuance of common stock, net of shares withheld for taxes, of $4.2 million, the repayment of a $7.5 million portion of our senior debt and the excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensation and other costs of $1.4 million.\nDuring 2014, we borrowed $49.2 million, net of issuance costs, in connection with the amendment of our senior debt, and used $41.3 million to repay a portion of our senior debt and certain seller notes payable. The remainder of our financing activities during the period was primarily composed of proceeds from the exercise of stock options by employees of $11.5 million and the excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensation and other costs of $12.2 million.\nDuring 2013, we received approximately $49.1 million of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, from the sale of shares of our common stock by us in our follow-on public offering and we received $85.4 million of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, from the sale of shares of our Series 1 common stock by us in our initial public offering. With the proceeds to us of our initial public offering, we (i) paid in full accumulated dividends on our previously outstanding shares of preferred stock, which totaled approximately $52.5 million, and (ii) repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest on seller notes issued in connection with our acquisition of eConversions Limited in 2012, which totaled approximately $6.6 million. We also paid approximately $6.1 million in deemed dividends to investors in exchange for voting in favor of the conversion of preferred stock to common stock in connection with our initial public offering. We borrowed $33.1 million, net of issuance costs, in connection with the\namendment of our senior debt, and used $32.9 million to repay portions of our senior debt and the seller notes issued in connection with our acquisition of the businesses of Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com during 2012.\nCapital Resources\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2015, we had $72.5 million in long-term debt outstanding, $10.0 million of which is classified as current maturities, and $95.0 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. Our long-term debt and revolving credit facility are more fully described in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of net revenues growth, the expansion of our marketing and sales initiatives, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the timing of introductions of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services, potential acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services. We may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to the extent necessary to fund such activities. Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us. We may enter into arrangements in the future with respect to investments in, or acquisitions of, similar or complementary businesses, products, services or technologies, which could also require us to seek additional debt or equity financing.\nIn February 2015 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million worth of our Series 1 common stock over a period of up to 24 months. In February 2016, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $50 million worth of shares of our Series 1 common stock, increasing the total authorized amount under our share repurchase program to $150 million. We have funded, and plan on funding in the future, any purchases under this program from one or a combination of existing cash balances, future cash flow, availability under our revolving credit facility and additional debt financing. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 4,323,000 shares of Series 1 common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $52.8 million. During the period between January 1, 2016 and February 5, 2016, we repurchased an additional 2,699,204 shares of Series 1 common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $23.7 million.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More\nThan 5\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations (including short-term debt) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>These amounts exclude estimated cash interest payments of approximately $2.2 million in 2016, $2.1 million in 2017, $1.9 million in 2018 and $2.0 million in 2019 (based on applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2015, in the case of variable interest rate debt).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>We lease our principal office facilities, including our headquarters in Austin, Texas, under non-cancellable operating leases.

The guidance provides a five-step process to recognize revenue that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected in exchange for those goods and services. The guidance requires disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. On July 9, 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017 for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after that date, using either a full or modified retrospective application method. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, but not before the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating which of the two retrospective application methods we will use and the effect that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance that amends the balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs. The guidance requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset. The guidance requires retrospective application and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance clarifying whether a customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as an acquisition of a software license or as a service arrangement by providing characteristics that a cloud computing arrangement must have in order to be accounted for as a software license acquisition. The guidance allows either retrospective or prospective application and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued new guidance that amends the balance sheet presentation for deferred tax assets and liabilities. The guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The guidance allows either retrospective or prospective application and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "The valuations of our acquired businesses have been performed by valuation specialists under our management's supervision. We believe that the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. However, such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ from those estimates. Future changes in our assumptions or the interrelationship of those assumptions may negatively impact future valuations. In future measurements of fair value, adverse changes in discounted cash flow assumptions could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets that would require a non-cash charge to the consolidated statements of operations and may have a material effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2014 compared to 2013. Our income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $19.4 million, or an increase of 2.8%, compared to income tax expense of $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our effective tax rate was 41.9% and 37.5% during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to tax charges associated with the implementation of our global corporate restructuring plan in the first fiscal quarter of 2014, non-deductible stock-based compensation charges, non-deductible deferred compensation expenses and state income taxes, which were partially offset by the effect of different statutory tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, tax credits and the benefit of disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options. As of December 31, 2013, our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to non-deductible, stock-based compensation charges, non-deductible deferred compensation expense and state taxes, which were partially offset by the effect of different statutory tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and tax credits.\nWe believe that featuring desirable digital offers is necessary to attract visitors to our marketplace, which includes our websites, mobile applications, email, mobile alerts and social media distribution channels. In addition to increasing the number of visitors to our marketplace, we are focused on increasing the rate and frequency at which these visitors make purchases from retailers whose digital offers are featured in our marketplace. To meet these challenges, we are focused on a combination of marketing strategies, including pay-per-click advertising, search engine optimization, branding campaigns and email and mobile alerts, with a goal of driving visits to our marketplace as well as increasing the exposure of the digital offer category. We are also investing in product enhancements to make it easier for consumers visiting our marketplace to search and find the right digital offers and in expanding the types of digital offers available to consumers on our marketplace. We believe these enhancements will increase consumers' interactions with retailers in our marketplace, which will in turn increase the value we are able to provide to our paid retailers.\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,988\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,981\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,980\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(315\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,102\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>672\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur acquisitions have required us to integrate new operations, offices and employees and to formulate and execute on marketing, product, sales, content and technology strategies associated with the acquired businesses.

A retailer is a merchant that sells goods or services directly to consumers. A paid retailer is a retailer, restaurant or brand that has contracted to pay us a commission for sales which we influence using digital offers made available in our marketplace and/or a retailer, restaurant or brand that we have a contract with to pay us to promote their digital offers or provide advertising in our marketplace. In some instances, the paid retailer itself provides affiliate tracking links for attribution of online sales using digital offers made available in our marketplace and pays us directly. However, in most cases, paid retailers contract with performance marketing networks to provide affiliate tracking links for attribution of online sales using digital offers made available in our marketplace. These paid retailers then pay the commissions we earn to the performance marketing network, which in turn pays those commissions to us. In general, our contracts with performance marketing networks govern our use of affiliate tracking links made available to us by the performance marketing network and the remittance of any commissions payable to us from paid retailers utilizing the performance marketing network. The performance marketing network with which a paid retailer contracts to provide affiliate tracking links provides us with the paid retailer's contract terms, which must be accepted by us and the paid retailer, and which further govern our use of affiliate tracking links for such paid retailer and payment of commissions to us. Our contracts are generally short term, meaning that they can be canceled by any of the contracting parties on 30 days' notice or less.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOur general and administrative expense consists primarily of the personnel costs of our general corporate functions, including executive, finance, accounting, legal and human resources. Other costs included in general and administrative include professional fees for legal, audit and other consulting services, travel and entertainment, charitable contributions, provision for doubtful accounts receivable and other general corporate overhead expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2016.\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Revenues by Source:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Desktop online transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mobile online transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Online transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>198,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising and in-store\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>264,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of Net Revenues by Source:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Desktop online transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mobile online transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Online transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising and in-store\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total percentage of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Revenues by Geography:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>195,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>206,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>264,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of Net Revenues by Geography:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total percentage of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2013, we used $11.4 million to acquire the business of YSL Ventures, Inc., $15.3 million to acquire the business of Ma-Reduc.com and $1.9 million to acquire the business of Actiepagina.nl in 2013.

Personnel costs for employees include salaries and amounts earned under variable compensation plans, payroll taxes, benefits, stock-based compensation expense, costs associated with recruiting new employees, travel costs and other employee-related costs.\nBESP. When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a stand-alone basis. BESP is generally used to allocate the selling price to deliverables in our multiple element arrangements. We determine BESP for deliverables by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, prices we charge for similar offerings, market conditions, competitive landscape and pricing practices. We limit the amount of allocable arrangement consideration to amounts that are fixed or determinable and that are not contingent on future performance or future deliverables.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Results\n \u2022 Expected Term. The expected term represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method\u201d allowed under applicable SEC guidance. We used the simplified method\u201d due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected life of the stock options. \n2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cost of net revenues increased by $5.6 million, or 42.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was largely attributable to a $3.5 million increase in personnel costs. The increase in personnel costs led to an increase in allocated facility and information technology costs of $0.8 million. We increased website operating costs by $0.9 million to expand capacity and improve the performance and scalability of our websites and mobile applications.\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of purchased intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets disposal (gain) or loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA significant component of our growth strategy has been to acquire and integrate businesses that complement our existing operations.

We have redirected traffic from Bons-de-Reduction.com to Poulpeo.com, and do not expect Bons-de-Reduction.com to provide additional income. As a result, we determined that a complete impairment of the remaining unamortized intangible assets associated with Bons-de-Reduction was warranted, resulting in an impairment charge of $2.3 million.\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn February 2015 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million worth of our Series 1 common stock over a period of up to 24 months. In February 2016, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $50 million worth of shares of our Series 1 common stock, increasing the total authorized amount under our share repurchase program to $150 million. We have funded, and plan on funding in the future, any purchases under this program from one or a combination of existing cash balances, future cash flow, availability under our revolving credit facility and additional debt financing. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 4,323,000 shares of Series 1 common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $52.8 million. During the period between January 1, 2016 and February 5, 2016, we repurchased an additional 2,699,204 shares of Series 1 common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $23.7 million.\nAdvertising and In-store Net Revenues. We define advertising net revenues collectively as amounts paid to us by paid retailers for displaying digital offers that may be redeemed on one of our websites, as well as amounts paid to us by paid retailers for providing advertising of the retailer's brand or products in our marketplace. We define in-store net revenues collectively as commission amounts earned from paid retailers when a consumer presents a digital offer to the retailer and the digital offer is scanned or a unique digital offer code is entered by the retailer at the point of sale, as well as other amounts paid to us by paid retailers for displaying digital offers on our websites and mobile applications that may be redeemed in-store.\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More\nThan 5\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations (including short-term debt) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDesktop Online Transaction Net Revenues. We define desktop online transaction net revenues as amounts paid to us by paid retailers, either directly or through performance marketing networks, in the form of commissions for completed online transactions on desktop computers and tablet devices. In general, we earn a commission from a paid retailer when a consumer clicks on a digital offer for that paid retailer on one of our websites or tablet applications and then makes an online purchase from that paid retailer.\n2015 compared to 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cost of net revenues increased by $1.3 million, or 6.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was largely attributable to a $0.4 million increase in personnel costs and a $0.4 million increase in website operating costs. We increased website operating costs to expand capacity and improve the performance and scalability of our websites and mobile applications.\nNet Revenues. We define net revenues as the total of our online transaction net revenues and our advertising and in-store net revenues. We believe net revenues are an important indicator for our business because they are a reflection of the value we offer to consumers and retailers through our marketplace.\n\n2014 compared to 2013. Net revenues increased by $54.8 million, or 26.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nKey Financial and Operating Metrics\nIncome Taxes\nDuring 2013, we received approximately $49.1 million of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, from the sale of shares of our common stock by us in our follow-on public offering and we received $85.4 million of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, from the sale of shares of our Series 1 common stock by us in our initial public offering. With the proceeds to us of our initial public offering, we (i) paid in full accumulated dividends on our previously outstanding shares of preferred stock, which totaled approximately $52.5 million, and (ii) repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest on seller notes issued in connection with our acquisition of eConversions Limited in 2012, which totaled approximately $6.6 million. We also paid approximately $6.1 million in deemed dividends to investors in exchange for voting in favor of the conversion of preferred stock to common stock in connection with our initial public offering. We borrowed $33.1 million, net of issuance costs, in connection with the\n2015 compared to 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, sales and marketing expense increased by $9.3 million, or 10.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to a $6.2 million increase in personnel costs. We increased personnel in order to continue the expansion of our sales teams to support our business and to further strengthen relationships with leading retailers. Online, brand and other marketing expenses increased by $3.9 million. This increase was primarily attributable to online advertising for brand building, contextual advertising placements and user acquisition efforts. These increases were offset by a $1.1 million decrease in paid search expenses.\n \u2022 Fair Value of Our Common Stock. Because our stock was not publicly traded prior to our offering in July 2013, the fair value of our common stock underlying our stock options was previously determined by our board of directors, which intended all options to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant. Following the completion of our initial public offering our common stock is being valued by reference to its publicly traded price. \nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of net revenues growth, the expansion of our marketing and sales initiatives, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the timing of introductions of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services, potential acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services. We may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to the extent necessary to fund such activities. Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us. We may enter into arrangements in the future with respect to investments in, or acquisitions of, similar or complementary businesses, products, services or technologies, which could also require us to seek additional debt or equity financing.\nWe record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.\nDuring 2015, we borrowed $30.0 million under our revolving credit facility. We used $52.9 million of our cash to repurchase our Series 1 common stock. The remainder of our financing activities was primarily composed of proceeds from the issuance of common stock, net of shares withheld for taxes, of $4.2 million, the repayment of a $7.5 million portion of our senior debt and the excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensation and other costs of $1.4 million.\nWe measure stock-based compensation expense at fair value and generally recognize the corresponding compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the service period during which awards are expected to vest. Forfeiture rates are estimated periodically based on historical experience and adjusted in subsequent periods for differences in actual forfeitures from those estimates.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nProduct Development\nCash provided by operating activities primarily consists of our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $60.5 million, $61.4 million and $31.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOther operating expenses for 2014 and 2013 consist primarily of amortization expense related to deferred compensation agreements with the selling stockholders of YSL Ventures, Inc. and Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com. In 2012, we acquired Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com and issued $3.5 million in seller notes to the selling stockholders of the business. These seller notes were due and payable contingent upon the continued employment of the selling stockholders and as a result have been recorded as deferred compensation, which we amortized over the term of the compensation arrangement with the sellers, which was completed in May 2014.\n\nAmounts included in other income (expense) include interest income earned on our available cash and cash equivalents, interest expense incurred in connection with our long term debt and the amortization of deferred financing costs. We also include in other income (expense), net foreign currency exchange gains and losses, as well as gains and losses related to our\nResults of Operations\nOur cost of net revenues consists of direct and indirect costs incurred to generate net revenues. These costs consist primarily of personnel costs of our merchandising, site operations and website technical support employees; fees paid to third-party contractors engaged in the operation and maintenance of our websites and mobile applications; depreciation; and website hosting and Internet service costs. We expect our cost of net revenues to increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2016 as we continue to build our infrastructure to support our business across multiple markets, endeavor to improve offer diversity and quality and increase the number and amount of consumer purchases resulting from visits to our websites and from use of our mobile applications.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles\n2014 compared to 2013. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $4.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively, in deferred compensation charges for our October 2013 acquisition of the business of YSL Ventures, Inc. and our May 2012 acquisition of the businesses of Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com. Our obligations to pay the outstanding amounts under these deferred compensation arrangements are contingent upon the continued employment of the selling stockholders and, as a result, have been recorded as deferred compensation, which we amortize over the term of the compensation arrangements with the sellers.\nCapital Resources\n\nDuring 2015, cash flows from operating activities were primarily generated through net income of $11.8 million, including the impact of depreciation and amortization expense of $17.1 million, stock-based compensation expense of $26.9 million, intangible asset impairment expense of $2.3 million and the amortization of deferred compensation of $2.3 million.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance clarifying whether a customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as an acquisition of a software license or as a service arrangement by providing characteristics that a cloud computing arrangement must have in order to be accounted for as a software license acquisition. The guidance allows either retrospective or prospective application and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe expect other operating expenses to decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2016 as a result of the completion during 2015 of our deferred compensation agreement with the selling stockholders of YSL Ventures, Inc.\nMobile Online Transaction Net Revenues per Visit. We define mobile online transaction net revenues per visit as mobile online transaction net revenues for the period divided by mobile visits for the period.\nOur primary financing activities for the periods presented consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock, proceeds from and repayments of our long term debt, the repurchase of our Series 1 common stock and share based payment activity. Net cash used in financing activities was $24.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash provided by financing activities was $31.4 million and $73.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe also intend to enhance the monetization of our websites and mobile applications by making product improvements that appeal to both consumers and retailers. These enhancements include increased leveraging of data to better personalize digital offers for consumers and to be a more effective channel for paid retailers to leverage our audience of users; further developing the location-based services features on our mobile applications to provide more geographically relevant digital offers; expanding food and dining content, which we believe consumers use on a more frequent basis; and continuing to invest in product functionality that encourages engagement of our community of users.\n\nProduct Development\nWe operate a leading digital savings destination connecting consumers with retailers, restaurants and brands, both online and in-store. In the year ended December 31, 2015, our marketplace featured digital offers from over 70,000 retailers and brands, and we had contracts with more than 12,000 retailers. According to our internal data compiled using Google Analytics, we had approximately 718 million total visits to our desktop and mobile websites. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we averaged approximately 23.2 million mobile unique visitors per month.\nWe consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability related to the U.S. federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes of our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the U.S. Should we decide to repatriate our foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that those earnings would no longer be indefinitely invested outside the U.S.\nContractual Obligations\n\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed or settled. We regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Any change in the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. ASC 740 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits.\n\nDesktop Online Transaction Net Revenues per Visit. We define desktop online transaction net revenues per visit as desktop online transaction net revenues for the period divided by desktop visits for the period.\nDuring 2013, cash flows from operating activities were primarily generated through net income of $31.5 million, including the impact of depreciation and amortization expense of $14.1 million and stock-based compensation expense of $10.5 million, offset by $23.6 million from changes in cash flows associated with operating assets and liabilities. The changes in cash flows associated with operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable of $25.7 million due to our net revenues growth.\nOur business is directly affected by the behavior of consumers. Economic conditions and competitive pressures can impact, both positively and negatively, the types of digital offers featured on our websites and mobile applications and the rates at which consumers utilize them. Consequently, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued new guidance that amends the balance sheet presentation for deferred tax assets and liabilities. The guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The guidance allows either retrospective or prospective application and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n2015 compared to 2014. Our income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $9.0 million, or a decrease of 53.6%, compared to income tax expense of $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our effective tax rate was 43.2% and 41.9% during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to non-deductible stock-based compensation charges, non-deductible deferred compensation expenses and state income taxes and tax charges associated with the implementation of our global corporate restructuring plan, which were partially offset by the effect of different statutory tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, tax credits and the benefit of disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options. As of December 31, 2014, our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to tax charges associated with the implementation of our global corporate restructuring plan in the first fiscal quarter of 2014, non-deductible stock-based compensation charges, non-deductible deferred compensation expenses and state income taxes, which were partially offset by the effect of different statutory tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, tax credits and the benefit of disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options.\nMobile Visits. We define a mobile visit as an interaction or group of interactions that takes place on one of our mobile websites from smartphones and other mobile devices within a given time frame as measured by Google Analytics, a product that provides digital marketing intelligence. A single visit can contain multiple page views, events, social interactions, custom variables, and e-commerce transactions. A single visitor can open multiple visits. Visits can occur on the same day, or over several days, weeks, or months. As soon as one visit ends, there is then an opportunity to start a new visit. A visit ends either through the passage of time or a campaign change, with a campaign generally meaning arrival via search engine, referring site, or campaign-tagged information. A visit ends through passage of time either after 30 minutes of inactivity or at midnight Pacific Time. A visit ends through a campaign change if a visitor arrives via one campaign or source, leaves the site, and then returns via another campaign or source. Currently, mobile visits do not include interactions on our mobile applications.\nMobile Unique Visitors. This amount represents the average number of monthly mobile unique visitors for the last three months of the period. We define each of the following as a mobile unique visitor: (i) the first time a specific mobile device accesses one of our mobile applications during a calendar month, and (ii) the first time a specific mobile device accesses one of our mobile websites using a specific web browser during a calendar month. If a mobile device accesses more than one of our mobile websites or mobile applications in a single calendar month, the first access to each such mobile website or mobile application is counted as a mobile unique visitor, as they are tracked separately for each mobile domain. We measure mobile unique visitors with a combination of internal data sources and Google Analytics data.\nOur product development expense consists primarily of personnel costs of our product management and software engineering teams, as well as fees paid to third-party contractors and consultants engaged in the design, development, testing and improvement of the functionality and user experience of our websites and mobile applications. We intend to continue to increase our software engineering resources over the next year by hiring additional personnel to develop new features and products for our websites and mobile applications. We expect these additional investments to cause our product development expense to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2016.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment process tested at the reporting segment level. In the first step, the fair value for our reporting unit is compared to our book value including goodwill. For purposes of performing the required impairment test, we derive enterprise fair value utilizing the market capitalization approach, whereby the market value of our outstanding shares of common stock are utilized to calculate the fair value of our sole reporting unit. In the case that the fair value is less than the book value, a second step is performed that compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the book value of the goodwill. The fair value for the implied goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the sole reporting segment and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities excluding goodwill. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations.\n2014 compared to 2013. The decrease in interest expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily the result of the repayment of seller notes we issued in connection with our acquisitions of businesses. The change in other income (expense), net is due to incurring a net foreign currency exchange loss of $0.9 million in 2014 as compared to a net foreign currency exchange gain of $0.7 million in 2013. Our net foreign currency exchange loss in 2014 includes the offsetting impact of a gain of $0.2 million related to our foreign exchange derivative instruments. We did not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments prior to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOther Operating Expenses\nVisits. We define visits as the total of our desktop visits and mobile visits. We view visits to our websites as a key indicator of our brand awareness among consumers and whether we are providing consumers with useful products and features, thereby increasing their usage of our marketplace. We believe that a higher level of usage may contribute to an increase in our net revenues and exclusive digital offers as retailers will have exposure to a larger potential customer base.\nSales and Marketing\nOur overall operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, including seasonal factors and economic cycles that influence consumer purchasing of retail products. Historically, we have experienced the highest levels of visitors to our websites and mobile applications and net revenues in the fourth quarter of the year, which coincides with the winter holiday season in the U.S. and Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we generated net revenues of $83.1 million which represented 33.4% of our net revenues for 2015. This seasonality may not be fully evident in our historical business performance because of our significant growth in prior years and the timing of our acquisitions. For instance, we have entered new markets through international acquisitions and increased the number of paid retailer and performance marketing network relationships. These changes have contributed to the substantial growth in our net revenues and corresponding increases in our operating costs and expenses to support our growth. Further, net revenues from our advertising and in-store products are even more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter of the year. As net revenues from this part of our business grow as a percentage of overall net revenues, for example to 20.4% from 11.1% of overall net revenues for 2015 and 2014, respectively, our seasonality may increase.\n (2) We lease our principal office facilities, including our headquarters in Austin, Texas, under non-cancellable operating leases. Certain leases contain periodic rent escalation adjustments and renewal and expansion options. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease periods. Operating lease obligations expire at various dates with the latest maturity in 2024. We are also responsible for certain real estate taxes, utilities, and maintenance costs on our office facilities. \nIn 2015, the substantial majority of our net revenues were derived from commissions earned when consumers made purchases using digital offers featured on our websites and mobile applications. We expect that a majority of our net revenues in the future will continue to be derived from these commissions. Commission rates are determined through negotiations with retailers based on a variety of factors, including the level of exposure to consumers in our marketplace, the quality and volume of sales realized from consumers using digital offers from our marketplace and the category of products purchased using digital offers. We sell our solutions to retailers, restaurants and brands through a direct sales force.\nDuring 2015, 2014 and 2013, we used $15.2 million, $13.0 million and $8.3 million, respectively, related to the purchase of computer equipment and software, office furniture and fixtures, leasehold improvements, certain capitalized internally developed software and website development costs and domain names. As we expand our business, we intend to purchase additional technology resources and invest in our operating facilities.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define this metric as net income plus depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, third party acquisition-related costs, other non-cash operating expenses (including asset impairment charges and compensation arrangements entered into in connection with acquisitions), net interest expense, other non-operating income and expenses and income taxes, net of any foreign exchange income or expenses. We believe that the use of adjusted EBITDA is helpful in evaluating our operating performance because it excludes certain non-cash expenses, including depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense. See page 42 in Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data\u201d for additional discussion of adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nCost of Net Revenues\n2015 compared to 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased by $1.6 million, or 12.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in amortization expense was due to the expiration of the useful life of certain of the purchased intangible assets as part of our acquisition of the businesses of Actiepagina.nl in March 2013, Ma-Reduc.com in July 2013 and YSL Ventures, Inc. in October 2013.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued new guidance that superseded previously existing revenue recognition requirements. The guidance provides a five-step process to recognize revenue that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected in exchange for those goods and services. The guidance requires disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. On July 9, 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017 for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after that date, using either a full or modified retrospective application method. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, but not before the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating which of the two retrospective application methods we will use and the effect that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d\n2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, general and administrative expense increased by $13.8 million, or 48.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to an $8.2 million increase in personnel costs. We added personnel to further build-out our human resources function, to increase our business development efforts and to add resources in the finance and legal functions to operate as a public company. We also incurred an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts receivable of $3.2 million, of which $1.1 million is related to aged accounts identified in the transition to our new transaction reporting system.\nOther operating expenses for 2015 consist primarily of amortization expense related to deferred compensation agreements with the selling stockholders of YSL Ventures, Inc. and expense recognized as a result of the identified impairment of purchased intangible assets associated with Bons-de-Reduction.com.\nGeneral and Administrative\nNet Revenues\nWe view mobile unique visitors as a key indicator of the size of our mobile audience as well as our brand awareness among consumers and usage of our mobile solutions which we expect to be important as users increasingly rely on their mobile devices.\nIn August 2015, we announced a plan to reduce operating expenses in order to realign our cost structure with our current strategic plan. As part of this expense reduction, we reduced U.S. headcount by approximately 10%. We incurred approximately $1.2 million in severance costs associated with the targeted employee reductions, which were included in the results of our operations for 2015.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rate could be affected by differences between our anticipated and the actual mix of earnings generated across different tax jurisdictions which have higher or lower statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations.\n2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, amortization of purchased intangible assets increased by $0.2 million, or 1.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in amortization expense was primarily the result of the recognition of amortization expense associated with the addition of purchased intangible assets as part of our acquisitions of the businesses of Actiepagina.nl in March 2013, Ma-Reduc.com in July 2013 and YSL Ventures, Inc. in October 2013. The increases were partially offset by the expiration of the useful life of certain of the purchased intangible assets as part of our acquisition of the businesses of Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com in May 2012.\n \u2022 Risk-free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group.  The fair value of restricted stock units, or RSUs, equals their intrinsic value on the date of grant.\n\n (3) Purchase obligations primarily represent non-cancelable contractual obligations related to content licensing and technology agreements. \nIncome Taxes\nWe believe that these significant investments in our product, team, relationships and technology will enable our expansion into new markets and improve the quality, consistency and monetization of our marketplace.\nDuring 2014, we borrowed $49.2 million, net of issuance costs, in connection with the amendment of our senior debt, and used $41.3 million to repay a portion of our senior debt and certain seller notes payable. The remainder of our financing activities during the period was primarily composed of proceeds from the exercise of stock options by employees of $11.5 million and the excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensation and other costs of $12.2 million.\nOur primary investing activities for the periods presented consist of purchases of property and equipment and other assets, the purchase of a non-marketable investment and business acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities was $19.2 million, $13.0 million and $36.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nIn October 2015, we decided to no longer support the Bons-de-Reduction.com brand, and we have redirected traffic from Bons-de-Reduction.com to Poulpeo.com. As a result of this impairment indicator, we determined that a complete impairment of the remaining unamortized intangible assets related to Bons-de-Reduction.com was warranted, resulting in an impairment charge of $2.3 million. We did not record any intangible asset impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\n2015 compared to 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, general and administrative expense decreased by $2.5 million, or 6.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $2.5 million decrease in our provision for doubtful accounts receivable.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we did not, and we do not currently, have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\n \u2022 Expected Volatility. Since we do not have a significant trading history for our Series 1 common stock, the expected stock price volatility was estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for publicly-traded stock of comparable industry peers similar in size, stage of life cycle and financial leverage, based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants. We did not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers' common stock because the volume of activity was relatively low. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our Series 1 common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation. \namendment of our senior debt, and used $32.9 million to repay portions of our senior debt and the seller notes issued in connection with our acquisition of the businesses of Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com during 2012.\nWe intend to achieve future success by continuing to focus on improving the monetization of our mobile websites and mobile applications. Since the launch of our mobile websites and mobile applications, traffic to these properties has increased significantly. However, mobile traffic generally monetizes at a lower rate than desktop traffic. We believe the comparatively lower rate of monetization primarily results from the following: (1) mobile visits tend to be more exploratory in nature, due to lower purchase intent than desktop visits, difficulties in navigating from our mobile websites and applications to retailer websites and friction in the purchase process on retailers' mobile websites, (2) we do not receive sales commissions or attribution when consumers that visit our websites and mobile applications using a mobile device subsequently make a purchase by directly accessing a retailer's website on another device, such as a desktop or tablet or in-store (a circumstance known as cross device switching) and (3) some retailers currently do not recognize affiliate tracking links on their mobile websites or applications, and the tracking mechanisms related to such may not function to allow proper attribution of sales to us. We intend to introduce new methods of monetizing our consumer traffic, particularly the traffic to our mobile websites and applications, through a variety of methods, including improved attribution to us of the sales that we help drive for our retail and brand partners, the use of pricing structures other than our traditional commission-based model (particularly with respect to advertising) and the use of multichannel digital offer solutions.\n2015 compared to 2014. Net revenues decreased by $15.6 million, or 5.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nFinancial Metrics\nMobile Online Transaction Net Revenues. We define mobile online transaction net revenues as amounts paid to us by paid retailers, either directly or through performance marketing networks, in the form of commissions for completed online transactions on smartphones and other mobile devices. In general, we earn a commission from a paid retailer when a consumer clicks on a digital offer for that paid retailer on one of our websites or mobile applications and then makes an online purchase from that paid retailer.\n2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, sales and marketing expense increased by $19.8 million, or 28.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in advertising and personnel costs as we continue to build our brand, acquire new customers, increase consumer traffic to our websites and increase consumer downloads of our mobile applications in order to grow our business. Online, brand and other marketing expenses increased by $5.2 million. This increase was primarily attributable to public relations and offline and online advertising for brand building, contextual advertising placements and user acquisition efforts. We also incurred an increase of $3.4 million in paid search expenses. In addition, personnel costs increased by $11.1 million. We increased personnel in order to continue the expansion of our sales teams to support our growing business and to further strengthen relationships with leading retailers. We also added personnel to support the marketing initiatives described above and to expand our email marketing, social media and other consumer acquisition initiatives.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities, net revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below.\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n2015 compared to 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, product development expense increased by $3.7 million, or 7.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to a $3.9 million increase in personnel costs. We increased personnel in order to enhance the functionality of, and develop new features and products for, our websites and mobile applications, and to strengthen our reporting and analytics capabilities. Additionally, fees for third-party data storage and hosting services increased by $2.2 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase of $2.6 million in the amount of internally developed software and website development costs capitalized, net of depreciation expense recognized during the period, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The capitalized costs relate primarily to infrastructure development to enhance our advertising and in-store products, personalization capabilities and content quality and delivery capabilities.\nWe perform our annual impairment testing of goodwill as of October 1 of each year, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, significant changes in competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe overall decrease in net revenues was driven by a $45.7 million, or 20.8%, decrease in desktop online transaction net revenues, partially offset by a $8.7 million, or 55.6%, increase in mobile online transaction net revenues and a $21.4 million, or 72.7%, increase in our advertising and in-store net revenues. The decrease in our desktop online transaction net revenues was primarily caused by a 15.8% decrease in the total volume of visits to our desktop websites and was further driven by deterioration in the average commission rate paid to us. The growth in our mobile online transaction net revenues was primarily driven by a 50.8% increase in visits to our mobile websites, as well as improved monetization driven by an increase in the percentage of visits, including the incremental visits in the period, that resulted in a paid transaction. The growth in our advertising and in-store net revenues was primarily due to the expansion and efforts of our direct sales force as well as improvements to the usability and functionality enhancements of our in-store product.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther Operating Expenses\nOnline Transaction Net Revenues per Visit. We define online transaction net revenues per visit as online transaction net revenues for the period divided by visits for the period.\nThe substantial majority of our net revenues consist of commissions we receive from paid retailers, either directly or through performance marketing networks. In general, we earn commissions from a paid retailer when a consumer makes a purchase online from that paid retailer after clicking on a digital offer for that paid retailer on one of our websites or mobile applications. We also earn revenues from our in-store product, which include commissions earned from a retailer when a consumer presents a digital offer to the retailer in-store and the digital offer is scanned or a unique digital offer code is entered by the retailer at the point of sale, and amounts paid to us by retailers for displaying digital offers that may be redeemed in-store on our websites or mobile applications. We provide performance marketing solutions under contracts with retailers, which generally provide for commission payments to be facilitated by performance marketing networks. Commission rates are typically negotiated with individual retailers with which we have contracts. Our commission rates vary based on a variety of factors, including the retailer, the level of exposure to consumers in our marketplace, the quality and volume of sales realized from consumers using digital offers in our marketplace and the category of products purchased using digital offers. We recognize commission revenues when we receive confirmation that a consumer has completed a purchase transaction with a paid retailer, as reported to us through a performance marketing network, or in some cases, by the retailer directly. When a digital offer applies only to specific items, the discount to the consumer will be applied only to those specific items, but our commission is generally based on the aggregate purchase price of all items purchased at that time by the consumer. Finally, we also earn advertising revenues from advertising in our marketplace. Rates for advertising are typically negotiated with individual retailers with which we have contracts. Payments for advertising may be made directly by retailers or through performance marketing networks. We expect that the majority of our net revenues in the future will continue to be derived from commissions. Commission revenues are reported net of a reserve for estimated returns. We estimate returns based on our actual historical returns experience. These returns have not been significant.\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the fee to our customers is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. For commission revenues, which represent the substantial majority of our net revenues, revenue recognition generally occurs when a consumer, having visited one of our websites and clicked on a digital offer for a paid retailer, makes a purchase with such paid retailer, and completion of the order is reported to us by such paid retailer, either directly or through a performance marketing network. Certain paid retailers do not provide reporting until a cash payment is made. In those cases, which have historically not been significant, we record commission revenues on a cash basis. For advertising revenues, revenue recognition occurs over the period that we display a retailer's advertisements on our websites and mobile applications.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2014, we implemented a global corporate restructuring plan involving our non-U.S. entities to streamline our non-U.S. operations. The impact of this restructuring has resulted in, and may continue to result in, volatility in our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate.\nTPE. When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of services cannot be obtained. Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor services' selling prices are on a stand-alone basis. As a result, we have not been able to establish selling price based on TPE.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nOperating Metrics\nIn 2013, we acquired YSL Ventures, Inc. and entered into $6.2 million in deferred compensation agreements with the selling stockholders of the business, $3.1 million of which was paid in October 2014 and the remaining $3.1 million of which was paid in equal quarterly installments over the following year, concluding in October 2015. The deferred compensation was due and payable contingent upon the continued employment of the selling stockholders and as a result we amortized the associated expense over the term of the compensation arrangement with the sellers.\n\nThe overall increase in net revenues was driven by a $28.7 million, or 15.1%, increase in desktop online transaction net revenues, as well as an $9.7 million, or 161.0%, increase in mobile online transaction net revenues and a $16.4 million, or 126.8%, increase in our advertising and in-store net revenues. The increase in our desktop online transaction net revenues was primarily caused by an 8.6% increase in the total volume of visits to our desktop websites, as well as improved monetization driven by an increase in the percentage of visits that resulted in a paid transaction. The growth in our mobile online transaction net revenues was primarily driven by a 96.4% increase in visits to our mobile websites, as well as improved monetization driven by an increase in the percentage of visits, including the incremental visits in the period, that resulted in a paid transaction. The growth in our advertising and in-store net revenues was primarily due to the expansion and efforts of our direct sales force as well as improvements to the usability and functionality enhancements of our in-store product.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2015, we had $72.5 million in long-term debt outstanding, $10.0 million of which is classified as current maturities, and $95.0 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. Our long-term debt and revolving credit facility are more fully described in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nVSOE. We determine VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the stand-alone selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. We have not historically sold our services within a reasonably narrow pricing range. As a result, we have not been able to establish VSOE.\nDuring 2015 we generated net revenues of $249.1 million, a decrease of 5.9% from $264.7 million in 2014. Net income for 2015 was $11.8 million, a 56.1% decrease from $27.0 million in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was $71.9 million, a 23.4% decrease from $93.9 million in 2014. See Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data,\u201d page 43, for further discussion of adjusted EBITDA, our use of this measure, the limitations of this measure as an analytical tool, and the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nIn determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, we use recognized valuation methods, including the income approach, market approach and cost approach, and apply present value modeling. Our significant estimates in the income, market or cost approach include identifying business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable net revenues and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value. We also make certain assumptions specific to present value modeling valuation techniques which include risk-adjusted discount rates, future commission rates, rates of increase in operating expenses, weighted-average cost of capital, long-term growth rate assumptions and the future effective income tax rates.\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nCost of Net Revenues\nSince our inception, we have funded our operations and acquisitions primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, the issuance of equity securities through our initial public offering and follow-on offering, bank borrowings and cash flows from operations. We generated positive cash flow from operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. As of December 31, 2015, we had $259.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $244.5 million at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, certain of our foreign subsidiaries held approximately $16.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents. If these assets were distributed to the U.S., we might be subject to additional U.S. taxes in certain circumstances, subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits, and foreign withholding taxes. We have not provided for these taxes because we consider these assets to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. We have no plans or intentions to repatriate cumulative earnings of our foreign subsidiaries through December 31, 2015.\n\nWe also believe that recruiting, training and retaining talented employees and strengthening our direct relationships with consumers and retailers will be critical to our future success. We aim to further strengthen our value proposition for both consumers and retailers by scaling our expanded range of offer types. For example, we now offer sponsored category listings, more advertising opportunities and digital circulars and showcases to retailers and discounted digital gift cards and digital rebates to consumers.\nOur investments have led to uneven quarterly operating results due to increases in personnel costs, product and technology enhancements and the impact of our acquisitions and other strategic projects. The return on these investments is generally achieved in future periods and, as a result, these investments can adversely impact near term results.\n2015 compared to 2014. Interest expense, net, remained relatively constant for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The effect on interest expense, net, of an increase in average outstanding principal on our senior debt facility was offset by lower average interest rates on our outstanding debt, due to the repayment during 2014 of seller notes we issued in connection with our acquisitions of businesses.\nOnline Transaction Net Revenues. We define online transaction net revenues as the total of our desktop online transaction net revenues and our mobile online transaction net revenues.\nOther Income (Expense)\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe were formed in 2007 and began our operations as a marketplace for digital offers in November 2009 with the acquisitions of the businesses of Deals2Buy.com, Coupon7.com, Couponshare.com and CheapStingyBargains.com. In November 2010, we acquired the business of RetailMeNot.com. In August 2011, we acquired the business of VoucherCodes.co.uk, expanding our operations into the U.K. In April 2012, we acquired the businesses of Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com, expanding our operations into France. In March 2013, we acquired the business of Actiepagina.nl, expanding our operations into the Netherlands. In July 2013, we acquired the business of Ma-Reduc.com, expanding our existing operations in France. In October 2013, we acquired the business and associated offer validation technology of YSL Ventures, Inc., which operated under the name Zendeals. Our net revenues for 2013 include the revenues of Actiepagina.nl, Ma-Reduc.com and YSL Ventures, Inc. for the period from the respective acquisition dates through December 31, 2013.\nMultiple Element Arrangements. When we enter into revenue arrangements with customers that are comprised of multiple deliverables, we allocate consideration to all deliverables based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy. The objective of the hierarchy is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a stand-alone basis and requires the use of: (1) vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, if available; (2) third-party evidence, or TPE, if VSOE is not available; and (3) best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\n2015 compared to 2014. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $2.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in deferred compensation charges for our October 2013 acquisition of the business of YSL Ventures, Inc. and our May 2012 acquisition of the businesses of Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com. Our obligations to pay the outstanding amounts under these deferred compensation arrangements were contingent upon the continued employment of the selling stockholders and, as a result, have been recorded as deferred compensation, which we amortized over the term of the compensation arrangements with the sellers. The decrease in deferred compensation expense is due primarily to the May 2014 completion of our deferred compensation agreement with the selling stockholders of Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com and the October 2015 completion of our deferred compensation agreement with the selling stockholders of YSL Ventures, Inc.\nWe estimate and record a reserve based upon actual, historical return rates as reported to us by paid retailers to provide for end-user cancelations or product returns, which may not be reported by the paid retailer or performance marketing network until a subsequent date. As such, we report commission revenues net of the estimated returns reserve. Net revenues are reported net of sales taxes, where applicable.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nStock-Based Compensation\nCosts and Expenses\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nIf the facts and circumstances underlying the factors we considered change or should future facts and circumstances lead us to consider additional factors, both our determination of our relative selling price under the hierarchy and our BESPs could change in future periods.\nDuring 2014, cash flows from operating activities were primarily generated through net income of $27.0 million, including the impact of depreciation and amortization expense of $15.7 million, stock-based compensation expense of $24.5 million and the amortization of deferred compensation of $4.0 million, offset by excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensation and other costs of $12.2 million and a deferred income tax benefit of $4.2 million.\nNet Revenues\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nWe have recorded identifiable intangible assets in conjunction with our various acquisitions, and are amortizing those assets over their estimated useful lives. We perform impairment testing of goodwill annually on October 1 of each year and, in the case of intangibles with definite lives, whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We expect our amortization expenses to decline in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2016. However, changes in our amortization expenses will depend upon the level of our future acquisition activity.\n \u2022 Dividend Yield. We do not presently plan to pay cash dividends on our Series 1 common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero. \nWe measure our business using both financial and operating metrics. We use these metrics to assess the progress of our business, make decisions on where to allocate capital, time and technology investments, and assess the longer-term performance of our business. The key financial and operating metrics we use are as follows:\nforeign exchange derivative instruments. Changes in these amounts will depend to some extent upon the level of our future borrowing activity and movements in foreign currency.\nDesktop Visits. We define a desktop visit as an interaction or group of interactions that takes place on one of our websites from desktop computers and tablet devices within a given time frame as measured by Google Analytics, a product that provides digital marketing intelligence. A single visit can contain multiple page views, events, social interactions, custom variables, and e-commerce transactions. A single visitor can open multiple visits. Visits can occur on the same day, or over several days, weeks, or months. As soon as one visit ends, there is then an opportunity to start a new visit. A visit ends either through the passage of time or a campaign change, with a campaign generally meaning arrival via search engine, referring site, or campaign-tagged information. A visit ends through passage of time either after 30 minutes of inactivity or at midnight Pacific Time. A visit ends through a campaign change if a visitor arrives via one campaign or source, leaves the site, and then returns via another campaign or source. Currently, visits do not include interactions on our tablet applications.\nWe classify our costs and expenses into six categories: cost of net revenues, product development, sales and marketing, general and administrative, amortization of purchased intangible assets and other operating expenses. We allocate our personnel, facilities and general information technology, or IT, costs, which include IT and facilities-related personnel costs, rent, depreciation and other general costs, to all of the above categories of operating expenses, other than amortization of purchased intangibles and other operating expenses.\nWe also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements.\u201d Of those policies, we believe that the accounting policies discussed below involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of judgment by our management. We evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions on an ongoing basis, and while we believe that our estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.\nThe following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated. The period-to-period comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance that amends the balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs. The guidance requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset. The guidance requires retrospective application and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur effective tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in those jurisdictions, tax credits, state taxes and non-deductible expenses, such as deferred compensation, acquisition costs and stock-based compensation. Our mix of foreign versus U.S. income, our ability to generate tax credits and our incurrence of any non-deductible expenses will likely cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate in the future. Our effective tax rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.\nSales and Marketing\nFinally, we also plan to improve the consistency and reliability of our marketplace by continuing to invest in the development and implementation of certain universal software platforms to support our international websites. We believe this investment has allowed, and will allow in the future, us to more easily and rapidly expand organically in new geographic markets and integrate the systems of any additional digital offering businesses which we may acquire and should result in increased operational efficiency.\nDuring 2015, we used $4.0 million to invest in a non-controlling minority ownership stake in a privately-held marketing technology company in the United States.\n2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, product development expense increased by $17.3 million, or 56.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to a $14.7 million increase in personnel costs. The increase in personnel costs also led to an increase in allocated facilities and IT support costs of $1.6 million. We increased personnel in order to enhance the functionality of, and develop new features and products for, our websites and mobile applications, and to strengthen our reporting and analytics capabilities. Additionally, fees for usability studies and technology licenses used in the design and development of our websites increased by $3.4 million. These increases were partially offset by the capitalization of $2.6 million of internally developed software and website development costs related primarily to infrastructure development to enhance our in-store and advertising products, personalization capabilities and content quality and delivery capabilities.\nBusiness Combinations and the Recoverability of Goodwill and Long-Lived Intangible Assets\nMost of the businesses we have acquired did not have a significant amount of tangible assets. As a result, our acquisitions have resulted in the majority of the purchase price being allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. The long-lived intangible assets we have identified in each acquisition include customer relationships and marketing-related, contract-related and technology-based intangible assets. All of our long-lived intangible assets have a definite life that ranges from one year to 15 years, which we have determined reflects our best estimate of the pattern in which the economic benefit of the related intangible asset will be utilized.\nWe use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimates of a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include:", "item_7_text": "The valuations of our acquired businesses have been performed by valuation specialists under our management's supervision. We believe that the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. However, such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ from those estimates. Future changes in our assumptions or the interrelationship of those assumptions may negatively impact future valuations. In future measurements of fair value, adverse changes in discounted cash flow assumptions could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets that would require a non-cash charge to the consolidated statements of operations and may have a material effect on our financial condition and operating results.\n2014 compared to 2013. Our income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $19.4 million, or an increase of 2.8%, compared to income tax expense of $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our effective tax rate was 41.9% and 37.5% during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to tax charges associated with the implementation of our global corporate restructuring plan in the first fiscal quarter of 2014, non-deductible stock-based compensation charges, non-deductible deferred compensation expenses and state income taxes, which were partially offset by the effect of different statutory tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, tax credits and the benefit of disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options. As of December 31, 2013, our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to non-deductible, stock-based compensation charges, non-deductible deferred compensation expense and state taxes, which were partially offset by the effect of different statutory tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and tax credits.\nWe believe that featuring desirable digital offers is necessary to attract visitors to our marketplace, which includes our websites, mobile applications, email, mobile alerts and social media distribution channels. In addition to increasing the number of visitors to our marketplace, we are focused on increasing the rate and frequency at which these visitors make purchases from retailers whose digital offers are featured in our marketplace. To meet these challenges, we are focused on a combination of marketing strategies, including pay-per-click advertising, search engine optimization, branding campaigns and email and mobile alerts, with a goal of driving visits to our marketplace as well as increasing the exposure of the digital offer category. We are also investing in product enhancements to make it easier for consumers visiting our marketplace to search and find the right digital offers and in expanding the types of digital offers available to consumers on our marketplace. We believe these enhancements will increase consumers' interactions with retailers in our marketplace, which will in turn increase the value we are able to provide to our paid retailers.\nOur acquisitions have required us to integrate new operations, offices and employees and to formulate and execute on marketing, product, sales, content and technology strategies associated with the acquired businesses. We continue to manage multiple brands and certain of the technology platforms of the acquired businesses, which has increased our cost of operations.\nOur sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs of our sales, marketing, SEO and business analytics employees, as well as online and other advertising expenditures, branding programs and other marketing expenses. Our advertising, branding programs and other marketing costs include paid search advertising fees, online display advertising, including on social networking sites, television advertising, creative development fees, public relations, email campaigns, trade show costs, sweepstakes and promotions and other general marketing costs. We intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in 2016 to drive consumer traffic to our websites, encourage downloads of our mobile applications, strengthen our relationships with retailers and increase overall awareness of our brand. Therefore, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2016.\n (1) These amounts exclude estimated cash interest payments of approximately $2.2 million in 2016, $2.1 million in 2017, $1.9 million in 2018 and $2.0 million in 2019 (based on applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2015, in the case of variable interest rate debt). \nWe derive the substantial majority of our net revenues from retailers, restaurants or brands that pay us directly or through third-party performance marketing networks. A retailer is a merchant that sells goods or services directly to consumers. A paid retailer is a retailer, restaurant or brand that has contracted to pay us a commission for sales which we influence using digital offers made available in our marketplace and/or a retailer, restaurant or brand that we have a contract with to pay us to promote their digital offers or provide advertising in our marketplace. In some instances, the paid retailer itself provides affiliate tracking links for attribution of online sales using digital offers made available in our marketplace and pays us directly. However, in most cases, paid retailers contract with performance marketing networks to provide affiliate tracking links for attribution of online sales using digital offers made available in our marketplace. These paid retailers then pay the commissions we earn to the performance marketing network, which in turn pays those commissions to us. In general, our contracts with performance marketing networks govern our use of affiliate tracking links made available to us by the performance marketing network and the remittance of any commissions payable to us from paid retailers utilizing the performance marketing network. The performance marketing network with which a paid retailer contracts to provide affiliate tracking links provides us with the paid retailer's contract terms, which must be accepted by us and the paid retailer, and which further govern our use of affiliate tracking links for such paid retailer and payment of commissions to us. Our contracts are generally short term, meaning that they can be canceled by any of the contracting parties on 30 days' notice or less.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOur general and administrative expense consists primarily of the personnel costs of our general corporate functions, including executive, finance, accounting, legal and human resources. Other costs included in general and administrative include professional fees for legal, audit and other consulting services, travel and entertainment, charitable contributions, provision for doubtful accounts receivable and other general corporate overhead expenses. We expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2016.\nDuring 2013, we used $11.4 million to acquire the business of YSL Ventures, Inc., $15.3 million to acquire the business of Ma-Reduc.com and $1.9 million to acquire the business of Actiepagina.nl in 2013. We may have acquisitions in the future that could have a material impact on our cash flows and operations.\nLong-lived assets, including intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. When such events occur, we compare the carrying amounts of the assets to their undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates that there is impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and fair value.\nWe expect personnel costs will be higher in 2016, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues, when compared to 2015 as a result of our plan to increase personnel in 2016 as we continue to invest in our business. Personnel costs for employees include salaries and amounts earned under variable compensation plans, payroll taxes, benefits, stock-based compensation expense, costs associated with recruiting new employees, travel costs and other employee-related costs.\nBESP. When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a stand-alone basis. BESP is generally used to allocate the selling price to deliverables in our multiple element arrangements. We determine BESP for deliverables by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, prices we charge for similar offerings, market conditions, competitive landscape and pricing practices. We limit the amount of allocable arrangement consideration to amounts that are fixed or determinable and that are not contingent on future performance or future deliverables.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Results\n \u2022 Expected Term. The expected term represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method\u201d allowed under applicable SEC guidance. We used the simplified method\u201d due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected life of the stock options. \n2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, cost of net revenues increased by $5.6 million, or 42.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was largely attributable to a $3.5 million increase in personnel costs. The increase in personnel costs led to an increase in allocated facility and information technology costs of $0.8 million. We increased website operating costs by $0.9 million to expand capacity and improve the performance and scalability of our websites and mobile applications.\nA significant component of our growth strategy has been to acquire and integrate businesses that complement our existing operations. Though we did not acquire any businesses during 2015, we expect to do so in the future. We account for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting and allocate the purchase price of each acquired business to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair value at the purchase date. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe decrease in other expense, net is due to a decrease in our net foreign currency exchange loss from $0.9 million in 2014 to $0.4 million in 2015. Our net foreign currency exchange losses in 2015 and 2014 include the offsetting impact of a gain of $0.8 million and $0.2 million, respectively, related to our foreign exchange derivative instruments.\nWe are subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nIn October 2015, we decided to no longer support the Bons-de-Reduction.com brand. We have redirected traffic from Bons-de-Reduction.com to Poulpeo.com, and do not expect Bons-de-Reduction.com to provide additional income. As a result, we determined that a complete impairment of the remaining unamortized intangible assets associated with Bons-de-Reduction was warranted, resulting in an impairment charge of $2.3 million.\nIn February 2015 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million worth of our Series 1 common stock over a period of up to 24 months. In February 2016, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $50 million worth of shares of our Series 1 common stock, increasing the total authorized amount under our share repurchase program to $150 million. We have funded, and plan on funding in the future, any purchases under this program from one or a combination of existing cash balances, future cash flow, availability under our revolving credit facility and additional debt financing. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 4,323,000 shares of Series 1 common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $52.8 million. During the period between January 1, 2016 and February 5, 2016, we repurchased an additional 2,699,204 shares of Series 1 common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $23.7 million.\nAdvertising and In-store Net Revenues. We define advertising net revenues collectively as amounts paid to us by paid retailers for displaying digital offers that may be redeemed on one of our websites, as well as amounts paid to us by paid retailers for providing advertising of the retailer's brand or products in our marketplace. We define in-store net revenues collectively as commission amounts earned from paid retailers when a consumer presents a digital offer to the retailer and the digital offer is scanned or a unique digital offer code is entered by the retailer at the point of sale, as well as other amounts paid to us by paid retailers for displaying digital offers on our websites and mobile applications that may be redeemed in-store.\nDesktop Online Transaction Net Revenues. We define desktop online transaction net revenues as amounts paid to us by paid retailers, either directly or through performance marketing networks, in the form of commissions for completed online transactions on desktop computers and tablet devices. In general, we earn a commission from a paid retailer when a consumer clicks on a digital offer for that paid retailer on one of our websites or tablet applications and then makes an online purchase from that paid retailer.\n2015 compared to 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cost of net revenues increased by $1.3 million, or 6.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was largely attributable to a $0.4 million increase in personnel costs and a $0.4 million increase in website operating costs. We increased website operating costs to expand capacity and improve the performance and scalability of our websites and mobile applications.\nNet Revenues. We define net revenues as the total of our online transaction net revenues and our advertising and in-store net revenues. We believe net revenues are an important indicator for our business because they are a reflection of the value we offer to consumers and retailers through our marketplace.\n\n2014 compared to 2013. Net revenues increased by $54.8 million, or 26.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nKey Financial and Operating Metrics\nIncome Taxes\nDuring 2013, we received approximately $49.1 million of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, from the sale of shares of our common stock by us in our follow-on public offering and we received $85.4 million of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, from the sale of shares of our Series 1 common stock by us in our initial public offering. With the proceeds to us of our initial public offering, we (i) paid in full accumulated dividends on our previously outstanding shares of preferred stock, which totaled approximately $52.5 million, and (ii) repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest on seller notes issued in connection with our acquisition of eConversions Limited in 2012, which totaled approximately $6.6 million. We also paid approximately $6.1 million in deemed dividends to investors in exchange for voting in favor of the conversion of preferred stock to common stock in connection with our initial public offering. We borrowed $33.1 million, net of issuance costs, in connection with the\n2015 compared to 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, sales and marketing expense increased by $9.3 million, or 10.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to a $6.2 million increase in personnel costs. We increased personnel in order to continue the expansion of our sales teams to support our business and to further strengthen relationships with leading retailers. Online, brand and other marketing expenses increased by $3.9 million. This increase was primarily attributable to online advertising for brand building, contextual advertising placements and user acquisition efforts. These increases were offset by a $1.1 million decrease in paid search expenses.\n \u2022 Fair Value of Our Common Stock. Because our stock was not publicly traded prior to our offering in July 2013, the fair value of our common stock underlying our stock options was previously determined by our board of directors, which intended all options to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant. Following the completion of our initial public offering our common stock is being valued by reference to its publicly traded price. \nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of net revenues growth, the expansion of our marketing and sales initiatives, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the timing of introductions of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services, potential acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services. We may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to the extent necessary to fund such activities. Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us. We may enter into arrangements in the future with respect to investments in, or acquisitions of, similar or complementary businesses, products, services or technologies, which could also require us to seek additional debt or equity financing.\nWe record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.\nDuring 2015, we borrowed $30.0 million under our revolving credit facility. We used $52.9 million of our cash to repurchase our Series 1 common stock. The remainder of our financing activities was primarily composed of proceeds from the issuance of common stock, net of shares withheld for taxes, of $4.2 million, the repayment of a $7.5 million portion of our senior debt and the excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensation and other costs of $1.4 million.\nWe measure stock-based compensation expense at fair value and generally recognize the corresponding compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the service period during which awards are expected to vest. Forfeiture rates are estimated periodically based on historical experience and adjusted in subsequent periods for differences in actual forfeitures from those estimates.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nProduct Development\nCash provided by operating activities primarily consists of our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $60.5 million, $61.4 million and $31.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOther operating expenses for 2014 and 2013 consist primarily of amortization expense related to deferred compensation agreements with the selling stockholders of YSL Ventures, Inc. and Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com. In 2012, we acquired Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com and issued $3.5 million in seller notes to the selling stockholders of the business. These seller notes were due and payable contingent upon the continued employment of the selling stockholders and as a result have been recorded as deferred compensation, which we amortized over the term of the compensation arrangement with the sellers, which was completed in May 2014.\n\nAmounts included in other income (expense) include interest income earned on our available cash and cash equivalents, interest expense incurred in connection with our long term debt and the amortization of deferred financing costs. We also include in other income (expense), net foreign currency exchange gains and losses, as well as gains and losses related to our\nResults of Operations\nOur cost of net revenues consists of direct and indirect costs incurred to generate net revenues. These costs consist primarily of personnel costs of our merchandising, site operations and website technical support employees; fees paid to third-party contractors engaged in the operation and maintenance of our websites and mobile applications; depreciation; and website hosting and Internet service costs. We expect our cost of net revenues to increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2016 as we continue to build our infrastructure to support our business across multiple markets, endeavor to improve offer diversity and quality and increase the number and amount of consumer purchases resulting from visits to our websites and from use of our mobile applications.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles\n2014 compared to 2013. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $4.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively, in deferred compensation charges for our October 2013 acquisition of the business of YSL Ventures, Inc. and our May 2012 acquisition of the businesses of Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com. Our obligations to pay the outstanding amounts under these deferred compensation arrangements are contingent upon the continued employment of the selling stockholders and, as a result, have been recorded as deferred compensation, which we amortize over the term of the compensation arrangements with the sellers.\nCapital Resources\n\nDuring 2015, cash flows from operating activities were primarily generated through net income of $11.8 million, including the impact of depreciation and amortization expense of $17.1 million, stock-based compensation expense of $26.9 million, intangible asset impairment expense of $2.3 million and the amortization of deferred compensation of $2.3 million.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance clarifying whether a customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as an acquisition of a software license or as a service arrangement by providing characteristics that a cloud computing arrangement must have in order to be accounted for as a software license acquisition. The guidance allows either retrospective or prospective application and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe expect other operating expenses to decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2016 as a result of the completion during 2015 of our deferred compensation agreement with the selling stockholders of YSL Ventures, Inc.\nMobile Online Transaction Net Revenues per Visit. We define mobile online transaction net revenues per visit as mobile online transaction net revenues for the period divided by mobile visits for the period.\nOur primary financing activities for the periods presented consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock, proceeds from and repayments of our long term debt, the repurchase of our Series 1 common stock and share based payment activity. Net cash used in financing activities was $24.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash provided by financing activities was $31.4 million and $73.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe also intend to enhance the monetization of our websites and mobile applications by making product improvements that appeal to both consumers and retailers. These enhancements include increased leveraging of data to better personalize digital offers for consumers and to be a more effective channel for paid retailers to leverage our audience of users; further developing the location-based services features on our mobile applications to provide more geographically relevant digital offers; expanding food and dining content, which we believe consumers use on a more frequent basis; and continuing to invest in product functionality that encourages engagement of our community of users.\n\nProduct Development\nWe operate a leading digital savings destination connecting consumers with retailers, restaurants and brands, both online and in-store. In the year ended December 31, 2015, our marketplace featured digital offers from over 70,000 retailers and brands, and we had contracts with more than 12,000 retailers. According to our internal data compiled using Google Analytics, we had approximately 718 million total visits to our desktop and mobile websites. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we averaged approximately 23.2 million mobile unique visitors per month.\nWe consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability related to the U.S. federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes of our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the U.S. Should we decide to repatriate our foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that those earnings would no longer be indefinitely invested outside the U.S.\nContractual Obligations\n\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed or settled. We regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Any change in the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. ASC 740 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits.\n\nDesktop Online Transaction Net Revenues per Visit. We define desktop online transaction net revenues per visit as desktop online transaction net revenues for the period divided by desktop visits for the period.\nDuring 2013, cash flows from operating activities were primarily generated through net income of $31.5 million, including the impact of depreciation and amortization expense of $14.1 million and stock-based compensation expense of $10.5 million, offset by $23.6 million from changes in cash flows associated with operating assets and liabilities. The changes in cash flows associated with operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable of $25.7 million due to our net revenues growth.\nOur business is directly affected by the behavior of consumers. Economic conditions and competitive pressures can impact, both positively and negatively, the types of digital offers featured on our websites and mobile applications and the rates at which consumers utilize them. Consequently, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued new guidance that amends the balance sheet presentation for deferred tax assets and liabilities. The guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The guidance allows either retrospective or prospective application and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n2015 compared to 2014. Our income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $9.0 million, or a decrease of 53.6%, compared to income tax expense of $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our effective tax rate was 43.2% and 41.9% during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to non-deductible stock-based compensation charges, non-deductible deferred compensation expenses and state income taxes and tax charges associated with the implementation of our global corporate restructuring plan, which were partially offset by the effect of different statutory tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, tax credits and the benefit of disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options. As of December 31, 2014, our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to tax charges associated with the implementation of our global corporate restructuring plan in the first fiscal quarter of 2014, non-deductible stock-based compensation charges, non-deductible deferred compensation expenses and state income taxes, which were partially offset by the effect of different statutory tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, tax credits and the benefit of disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options.\nMobile Visits. We define a mobile visit as an interaction or group of interactions that takes place on one of our mobile websites from smartphones and other mobile devices within a given time frame as measured by Google Analytics, a product that provides digital marketing intelligence. A single visit can contain multiple page views, events, social interactions, custom variables, and e-commerce transactions. A single visitor can open multiple visits. Visits can occur on the same day, or over several days, weeks, or months. As soon as one visit ends, there is then an opportunity to start a new visit. A visit ends either through the passage of time or a campaign change, with a campaign generally meaning arrival via search engine, referring site, or campaign-tagged information. A visit ends through passage of time either after 30 minutes of inactivity or at midnight Pacific Time. A visit ends through a campaign change if a visitor arrives via one campaign or source, leaves the site, and then returns via another campaign or source. Currently, mobile visits do not include interactions on our mobile applications.\nMobile Unique Visitors. This amount represents the average number of monthly mobile unique visitors for the last three months of the period. We define each of the following as a mobile unique visitor: (i) the first time a specific mobile device accesses one of our mobile applications during a calendar month, and (ii) the first time a specific mobile device accesses one of our mobile websites using a specific web browser during a calendar month. If a mobile device accesses more than one of our mobile websites or mobile applications in a single calendar month, the first access to each such mobile website or mobile application is counted as a mobile unique visitor, as they are tracked separately for each mobile domain. We measure mobile unique visitors with a combination of internal data sources and Google Analytics data.\nOur product development expense consists primarily of personnel costs of our product management and software engineering teams, as well as fees paid to third-party contractors and consultants engaged in the design, development, testing and improvement of the functionality and user experience of our websites and mobile applications. We intend to continue to increase our software engineering resources over the next year by hiring additional personnel to develop new features and products for our websites and mobile applications. We expect these additional investments to cause our product development expense to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2016.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment process tested at the reporting segment level. In the first step, the fair value for our reporting unit is compared to our book value including goodwill. For purposes of performing the required impairment test, we derive enterprise fair value utilizing the market capitalization approach, whereby the market value of our outstanding shares of common stock are utilized to calculate the fair value of our sole reporting unit. In the case that the fair value is less than the book value, a second step is performed that compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the book value of the goodwill. The fair value for the implied goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the sole reporting segment and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities excluding goodwill. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations.\n2014 compared to 2013. The decrease in interest expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily the result of the repayment of seller notes we issued in connection with our acquisitions of businesses. The change in other income (expense), net is due to incurring a net foreign currency exchange loss of $0.9 million in 2014 as compared to a net foreign currency exchange gain of $0.7 million in 2013. Our net foreign currency exchange loss in 2014 includes the offsetting impact of a gain of $0.2 million related to our foreign exchange derivative instruments. We did not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments prior to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOther Operating Expenses\nVisits. We define visits as the total of our desktop visits and mobile visits. We view visits to our websites as a key indicator of our brand awareness among consumers and whether we are providing consumers with useful products and features, thereby increasing their usage of our marketplace. We believe that a higher level of usage may contribute to an increase in our net revenues and exclusive digital offers as retailers will have exposure to a larger potential customer base.\nSales and Marketing\nOur overall operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, including seasonal factors and economic cycles that influence consumer purchasing of retail products. Historically, we have experienced the highest levels of visitors to our websites and mobile applications and net revenues in the fourth quarter of the year, which coincides with the winter holiday season in the U.S. and Europe. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we generated net revenues of $83.1 million which represented 33.4% of our net revenues for 2015. This seasonality may not be fully evident in our historical business performance because of our significant growth in prior years and the timing of our acquisitions. For instance, we have entered new markets through international acquisitions and increased the number of paid retailer and performance marketing network relationships. These changes have contributed to the substantial growth in our net revenues and corresponding increases in our operating costs and expenses to support our growth. Further, net revenues from our advertising and in-store products are even more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter of the year. As net revenues from this part of our business grow as a percentage of overall net revenues, for example to 20.4% from 11.1% of overall net revenues for 2015 and 2014, respectively, our seasonality may increase.\n (2) We lease our principal office facilities, including our headquarters in Austin, Texas, under non-cancellable operating leases. Certain leases contain periodic rent escalation adjustments and renewal and expansion options. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease periods. Operating lease obligations expire at various dates with the latest maturity in 2024. We are also responsible for certain real estate taxes, utilities, and maintenance costs on our office facilities. \nIn 2015, the substantial majority of our net revenues were derived from commissions earned when consumers made purchases using digital offers featured on our websites and mobile applications. We expect that a majority of our net revenues in the future will continue to be derived from these commissions. Commission rates are determined through negotiations with retailers based on a variety of factors, including the level of exposure to consumers in our marketplace, the quality and volume of sales realized from consumers using digital offers from our marketplace and the category of products purchased using digital offers. We sell our solutions to retailers, restaurants and brands through a direct sales force.\nDuring 2015, 2014 and 2013, we used $15.2 million, $13.0 million and $8.3 million, respectively, related to the purchase of computer equipment and software, office furniture and fixtures, leasehold improvements, certain capitalized internally developed software and website development costs and domain names. As we expand our business, we intend to purchase additional technology resources and invest in our operating facilities.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define this metric as net income plus depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, third party acquisition-related costs, other non-cash operating expenses (including asset impairment charges and compensation arrangements entered into in connection with acquisitions), net interest expense, other non-operating income and expenses and income taxes, net of any foreign exchange income or expenses. We believe that the use of adjusted EBITDA is helpful in evaluating our operating performance because it excludes certain non-cash expenses, including depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense. See page 42 in Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data\u201d for additional discussion of adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nCost of Net Revenues\n2015 compared to 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased by $1.6 million, or 12.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in amortization expense was due to the expiration of the useful life of certain of the purchased intangible assets as part of our acquisition of the businesses of Actiepagina.nl in March 2013, Ma-Reduc.com in July 2013 and YSL Ventures, Inc. in October 2013.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued new guidance that superseded previously existing revenue recognition requirements. The guidance provides a five-step process to recognize revenue that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected in exchange for those goods and services. The guidance requires disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. On July 9, 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017 for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after that date, using either a full or modified retrospective application method. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, but not before the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after the original effective date of December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating which of the two retrospective application methods we will use and the effect that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d\n2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, general and administrative expense increased by $13.8 million, or 48.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to an $8.2 million increase in personnel costs. We added personnel to further build-out our human resources function, to increase our business development efforts and to add resources in the finance and legal functions to operate as a public company. We also incurred an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts receivable of $3.2 million, of which $1.1 million is related to aged accounts identified in the transition to our new transaction reporting system.\nOther operating expenses for 2015 consist primarily of amortization expense related to deferred compensation agreements with the selling stockholders of YSL Ventures, Inc. and expense recognized as a result of the identified impairment of purchased intangible assets associated with Bons-de-Reduction.com.\nGeneral and Administrative\nNet Revenues\nWe view mobile unique visitors as a key indicator of the size of our mobile audience as well as our brand awareness among consumers and usage of our mobile solutions which we expect to be important as users increasingly rely on their mobile devices.\nIn August 2015, we announced a plan to reduce operating expenses in order to realign our cost structure with our current strategic plan. As part of this expense reduction, we reduced U.S. headcount by approximately 10%. We incurred approximately $1.2 million in severance costs associated with the targeted employee reductions, which were included in the results of our operations for 2015.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rate could be affected by differences between our anticipated and the actual mix of earnings generated across different tax jurisdictions which have higher or lower statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations.\n2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, amortization of purchased intangible assets increased by $0.2 million, or 1.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in amortization expense was primarily the result of the recognition of amortization expense associated with the addition of purchased intangible assets as part of our acquisitions of the businesses of Actiepagina.nl in March 2013, Ma-Reduc.com in July 2013 and YSL Ventures, Inc. in October 2013. The increases were partially offset by the expiration of the useful life of certain of the purchased intangible assets as part of our acquisition of the businesses of Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com in May 2012.\n \u2022 Risk-free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group.  The fair value of restricted stock units, or RSUs, equals their intrinsic value on the date of grant.\n\n (3) Purchase obligations primarily represent non-cancelable contractual obligations related to content licensing and technology agreements. \nIncome Taxes\nWe believe that these significant investments in our product, team, relationships and technology will enable our expansion into new markets and improve the quality, consistency and monetization of our marketplace.\nDuring 2014, we borrowed $49.2 million, net of issuance costs, in connection with the amendment of our senior debt, and used $41.3 million to repay a portion of our senior debt and certain seller notes payable. The remainder of our financing activities during the period was primarily composed of proceeds from the exercise of stock options by employees of $11.5 million and the excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensation and other costs of $12.2 million.\nOur primary investing activities for the periods presented consist of purchases of property and equipment and other assets, the purchase of a non-marketable investment and business acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities was $19.2 million, $13.0 million and $36.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nIn October 2015, we decided to no longer support the Bons-de-Reduction.com brand, and we have redirected traffic from Bons-de-Reduction.com to Poulpeo.com. As a result of this impairment indicator, we determined that a complete impairment of the remaining unamortized intangible assets related to Bons-de-Reduction.com was warranted, resulting in an impairment charge of $2.3 million. We did not record any intangible asset impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\n2015 compared to 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, general and administrative expense decreased by $2.5 million, or 6.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $2.5 million decrease in our provision for doubtful accounts receivable.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we did not, and we do not currently, have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\n \u2022 Expected Volatility. Since we do not have a significant trading history for our Series 1 common stock, the expected stock price volatility was estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for publicly-traded stock of comparable industry peers similar in size, stage of life cycle and financial leverage, based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants. We did not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers' common stock because the volume of activity was relatively low. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our Series 1 common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation. \namendment of our senior debt, and used $32.9 million to repay portions of our senior debt and the seller notes issued in connection with our acquisition of the businesses of Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com during 2012.\nWe intend to achieve future success by continuing to focus on improving the monetization of our mobile websites and mobile applications. Since the launch of our mobile websites and mobile applications, traffic to these properties has increased significantly. However, mobile traffic generally monetizes at a lower rate than desktop traffic. We believe the comparatively lower rate of monetization primarily results from the following: (1) mobile visits tend to be more exploratory in nature, due to lower purchase intent than desktop visits, difficulties in navigating from our mobile websites and applications to retailer websites and friction in the purchase process on retailers' mobile websites, (2) we do not receive sales commissions or attribution when consumers that visit our websites and mobile applications using a mobile device subsequently make a purchase by directly accessing a retailer's website on another device, such as a desktop or tablet or in-store (a circumstance known as cross device switching) and (3) some retailers currently do not recognize affiliate tracking links on their mobile websites or applications, and the tracking mechanisms related to such may not function to allow proper attribution of sales to us. We intend to introduce new methods of monetizing our consumer traffic, particularly the traffic to our mobile websites and applications, through a variety of methods, including improved attribution to us of the sales that we help drive for our retail and brand partners, the use of pricing structures other than our traditional commission-based model (particularly with respect to advertising) and the use of multichannel digital offer solutions.\n2015 compared to 2014. Net revenues decreased by $15.6 million, or 5.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nFinancial Metrics\nMobile Online Transaction Net Revenues. We define mobile online transaction net revenues as amounts paid to us by paid retailers, either directly or through performance marketing networks, in the form of commissions for completed online transactions on smartphones and other mobile devices. In general, we earn a commission from a paid retailer when a consumer clicks on a digital offer for that paid retailer on one of our websites or mobile applications and then makes an online purchase from that paid retailer.\n2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, sales and marketing expense increased by $19.8 million, or 28.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in advertising and personnel costs as we continue to build our brand, acquire new customers, increase consumer traffic to our websites and increase consumer downloads of our mobile applications in order to grow our business. Online, brand and other marketing expenses increased by $5.2 million. This increase was primarily attributable to public relations and offline and online advertising for brand building, contextual advertising placements and user acquisition efforts. We also incurred an increase of $3.4 million in paid search expenses. In addition, personnel costs increased by $11.1 million. We increased personnel in order to continue the expansion of our sales teams to support our growing business and to further strengthen relationships with leading retailers. We also added personnel to support the marketing initiatives described above and to expand our email marketing, social media and other consumer acquisition initiatives.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities, net revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below.\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n2015 compared to 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, product development expense increased by $3.7 million, or 7.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to a $3.9 million increase in personnel costs. We increased personnel in order to enhance the functionality of, and develop new features and products for, our websites and mobile applications, and to strengthen our reporting and analytics capabilities. Additionally, fees for third-party data storage and hosting services increased by $2.2 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase of $2.6 million in the amount of internally developed software and website development costs capitalized, net of depreciation expense recognized during the period, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The capitalized costs relate primarily to infrastructure development to enhance our advertising and in-store products, personalization capabilities and content quality and delivery capabilities.\nWe perform our annual impairment testing of goodwill as of October 1 of each year, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, significant changes in competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe overall decrease in net revenues was driven by a $45.7 million, or 20.8%, decrease in desktop online transaction net revenues, partially offset by a $8.7 million, or 55.6%, increase in mobile online transaction net revenues and a $21.4 million, or 72.7%, increase in our advertising and in-store net revenues. The decrease in our desktop online transaction net revenues was primarily caused by a 15.8% decrease in the total volume of visits to our desktop websites and was further driven by deterioration in the average commission rate paid to us. The growth in our mobile online transaction net revenues was primarily driven by a 50.8% increase in visits to our mobile websites, as well as improved monetization driven by an increase in the percentage of visits, including the incremental visits in the period, that resulted in a paid transaction. The growth in our advertising and in-store net revenues was primarily due to the expansion and efforts of our direct sales force as well as improvements to the usability and functionality enhancements of our in-store product.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther Operating Expenses\nOnline Transaction Net Revenues per Visit. We define online transaction net revenues per visit as online transaction net revenues for the period divided by visits for the period.\nThe substantial majority of our net revenues consist of commissions we receive from paid retailers, either directly or through performance marketing networks. In general, we earn commissions from a paid retailer when a consumer makes a purchase online from that paid retailer after clicking on a digital offer for that paid retailer on one of our websites or mobile applications. We also earn revenues from our in-store product, which include commissions earned from a retailer when a consumer presents a digital offer to the retailer in-store and the digital offer is scanned or a unique digital offer code is entered by the retailer at the point of sale, and amounts paid to us by retailers for displaying digital offers that may be redeemed in-store on our websites or mobile applications. We provide performance marketing solutions under contracts with retailers, which generally provide for commission payments to be facilitated by performance marketing networks. Commission rates are typically negotiated with individual retailers with which we have contracts. Our commission rates vary based on a variety of factors, including the retailer, the level of exposure to consumers in our marketplace, the quality and volume of sales realized from consumers using digital offers in our marketplace and the category of products purchased using digital offers. We recognize commission revenues when we receive confirmation that a consumer has completed a purchase transaction with a paid retailer, as reported to us through a performance marketing network, or in some cases, by the retailer directly. When a digital offer applies only to specific items, the discount to the consumer will be applied only to those specific items, but our commission is generally based on the aggregate purchase price of all items purchased at that time by the consumer. Finally, we also earn advertising revenues from advertising in our marketplace. Rates for advertising are typically negotiated with individual retailers with which we have contracts. Payments for advertising may be made directly by retailers or through performance marketing networks. We expect that the majority of our net revenues in the future will continue to be derived from commissions. Commission revenues are reported net of a reserve for estimated returns. We estimate returns based on our actual historical returns experience. These returns have not been significant.\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the fee to our customers is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. For commission revenues, which represent the substantial majority of our net revenues, revenue recognition generally occurs when a consumer, having visited one of our websites and clicked on a digital offer for a paid retailer, makes a purchase with such paid retailer, and completion of the order is reported to us by such paid retailer, either directly or through a performance marketing network. Certain paid retailers do not provide reporting until a cash payment is made. In those cases, which have historically not been significant, we record commission revenues on a cash basis. For advertising revenues, revenue recognition occurs over the period that we display a retailer's advertisements on our websites and mobile applications.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2014, we implemented a global corporate restructuring plan involving our non-U.S. entities to streamline our non-U.S. operations. The impact of this restructuring has resulted in, and may continue to result in, volatility in our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate.\nTPE. When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of services cannot be obtained. Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor services' selling prices are on a stand-alone basis. As a result, we have not been able to establish selling price based on TPE.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nOperating Metrics\nIn 2013, we acquired YSL Ventures, Inc. and entered into $6.2 million in deferred compensation agreements with the selling stockholders of the business, $3.1 million of which was paid in October 2014 and the remaining $3.1 million of which was paid in equal quarterly installments over the following year, concluding in October 2015. The deferred compensation was due and payable contingent upon the continued employment of the selling stockholders and as a result we amortized the associated expense over the term of the compensation arrangement with the sellers.\n\nThe overall increase in net revenues was driven by a $28.7 million, or 15.1%, increase in desktop online transaction net revenues, as well as an $9.7 million, or 161.0%, increase in mobile online transaction net revenues and a $16.4 million, or 126.8%, increase in our advertising and in-store net revenues. The increase in our desktop online transaction net revenues was primarily caused by an 8.6% increase in the total volume of visits to our desktop websites, as well as improved monetization driven by an increase in the percentage of visits that resulted in a paid transaction. The growth in our mobile online transaction net revenues was primarily driven by a 96.4% increase in visits to our mobile websites, as well as improved monetization driven by an increase in the percentage of visits, including the incremental visits in the period, that resulted in a paid transaction. The growth in our advertising and in-store net revenues was primarily due to the expansion and efforts of our direct sales force as well as improvements to the usability and functionality enhancements of our in-store product.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2015, we had $72.5 million in long-term debt outstanding, $10.0 million of which is classified as current maturities, and $95.0 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. Our long-term debt and revolving credit facility are more fully described in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nVSOE. We determine VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the stand-alone selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. We have not historically sold our services within a reasonably narrow pricing range. As a result, we have not been able to establish VSOE.\nDuring 2015 we generated net revenues of $249.1 million, a decrease of 5.9% from $264.7 million in 2014. Net income for 2015 was $11.8 million, a 56.1% decrease from $27.0 million in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was $71.9 million, a 23.4% decrease from $93.9 million in 2014. See Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data,\u201d page 43, for further discussion of adjusted EBITDA, our use of this measure, the limitations of this measure as an analytical tool, and the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nIn determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, we use recognized valuation methods, including the income approach, market approach and cost approach, and apply present value modeling. Our significant estimates in the income, market or cost approach include identifying business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable net revenues and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value. We also make certain assumptions specific to present value modeling valuation techniques which include risk-adjusted discount rates, future commission rates, rates of increase in operating expenses, weighted-average cost of capital, long-term growth rate assumptions and the future effective income tax rates.\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nCost of Net Revenues\nSince our inception, we have funded our operations and acquisitions primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, the issuance of equity securities through our initial public offering and follow-on offering, bank borrowings and cash flows from operations. We generated positive cash flow from operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. As of December 31, 2015, we had $259.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $244.5 million at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015, certain of our foreign subsidiaries held approximately $16.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents. If these assets were distributed to the U.S., we might be subject to additional U.S. taxes in certain circumstances, subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits, and foreign withholding taxes. We have not provided for these taxes because we consider these assets to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. We have no plans or intentions to repatriate cumulative earnings of our foreign subsidiaries through December 31, 2015.\n\nWe also believe that recruiting, training and retaining talented employees and strengthening our direct relationships with consumers and retailers will be critical to our future success. We aim to further strengthen our value proposition for both consumers and retailers by scaling our expanded range of offer types. For example, we now offer sponsored category listings, more advertising opportunities and digital circulars and showcases to retailers and discounted digital gift cards and digital rebates to consumers.\nOur investments have led to uneven quarterly operating results due to increases in personnel costs, product and technology enhancements and the impact of our acquisitions and other strategic projects. The return on these investments is generally achieved in future periods and, as a result, these investments can adversely impact near term results.\n2015 compared to 2014. Interest expense, net, remained relatively constant for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The effect on interest expense, net, of an increase in average outstanding principal on our senior debt facility was offset by lower average interest rates on our outstanding debt, due to the repayment during 2014 of seller notes we issued in connection with our acquisitions of businesses.\nOnline Transaction Net Revenues. We define online transaction net revenues as the total of our desktop online transaction net revenues and our mobile online transaction net revenues.\nOther Income (Expense)\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe were formed in 2007 and began our operations as a marketplace for digital offers in November 2009 with the acquisitions of the businesses of Deals2Buy.com, Coupon7.com, Couponshare.com and CheapStingyBargains.com. In November 2010, we acquired the business of RetailMeNot.com. In August 2011, we acquired the business of VoucherCodes.co.uk, expanding our operations into the U.K. In April 2012, we acquired the businesses of Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com, expanding our operations into France. In March 2013, we acquired the business of Actiepagina.nl, expanding our operations into the Netherlands. In July 2013, we acquired the business of Ma-Reduc.com, expanding our existing operations in France. In October 2013, we acquired the business and associated offer validation technology of YSL Ventures, Inc., which operated under the name Zendeals. Our net revenues for 2013 include the revenues of Actiepagina.nl, Ma-Reduc.com and YSL Ventures, Inc. for the period from the respective acquisition dates through December 31, 2013.\nMultiple Element Arrangements. When we enter into revenue arrangements with customers that are comprised of multiple deliverables, we allocate consideration to all deliverables based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy. The objective of the hierarchy is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a stand-alone basis and requires the use of: (1) vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, if available; (2) third-party evidence, or TPE, if VSOE is not available; and (3) best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\n2015 compared to 2014. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $2.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in deferred compensation charges for our October 2013 acquisition of the business of YSL Ventures, Inc. and our May 2012 acquisition of the businesses of Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com. Our obligations to pay the outstanding amounts under these deferred compensation arrangements were contingent upon the continued employment of the selling stockholders and, as a result, have been recorded as deferred compensation, which we amortized over the term of the compensation arrangements with the sellers. The decrease in deferred compensation expense is due primarily to the May 2014 completion of our deferred compensation agreement with the selling stockholders of Bons-de-Reduction.com and Poulpeo.com and the October 2015 completion of our deferred compensation agreement with the selling stockholders of YSL Ventures, Inc.\nWe estimate and record a reserve based upon actual, historical return rates as reported to us by paid retailers to provide for end-user cancelations or product returns, which may not be reported by the paid retailer or performance marketing network until a subsequent date. As such, we report commission revenues net of the estimated returns reserve. Net revenues are reported net of sales taxes, where applicable.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nStock-Based Compensation\nCosts and Expenses\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nIf the facts and circumstances underlying the factors we considered change or should future facts and circumstances lead us to consider additional factors, both our determination of our relative selling price under the hierarchy and our BESPs could change in future periods.\nDuring 2014, cash flows from operating activities were primarily generated through net income of $27.0 million, including the impact of depreciation and amortization expense of $15.7 million, stock-based compensation expense of $24.5 million and the amortization of deferred compensation of $4.0 million, offset by excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensation and other costs of $12.2 million and a deferred income tax benefit of $4.2 million.\nNet Revenues\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nWe have recorded identifiable intangible assets in conjunction with our various acquisitions, and are amortizing those assets over their estimated useful lives. We perform impairment testing of goodwill annually on October 1 of each year and, in the case of intangibles with definite lives, whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We expect our amortization expenses to decline in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2016. However, changes in our amortization expenses will depend upon the level of our future acquisition activity.\n \u2022 Dividend Yield. We do not presently plan to pay cash dividends on our Series 1 common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero. \nWe measure our business using both financial and operating metrics. We use these metrics to assess the progress of our business, make decisions on where to allocate capital, time and technology investments, and assess the longer-term performance of our business. The key financial and operating metrics we use are as follows:\nforeign exchange derivative instruments. Changes in these amounts will depend to some extent upon the level of our future borrowing activity and movements in foreign currency.\nDesktop Visits. We define a desktop visit as an interaction or group of interactions that takes place on one of our websites from desktop computers and tablet devices within a given time frame as measured by Google Analytics, a product that provides digital marketing intelligence. A single visit can contain multiple page views, events, social interactions, custom variables, and e-commerce transactions. A single visitor can open multiple visits. Visits can occur on the same day, or over several days, weeks, or months. As soon as one visit ends, there is then an opportunity to start a new visit. A visit ends either through the passage of time or a campaign change, with a campaign generally meaning arrival via search engine, referring site, or campaign-tagged information. A visit ends through passage of time either after 30 minutes of inactivity or at midnight Pacific Time. A visit ends through a campaign change if a visitor arrives via one campaign or source, leaves the site, and then returns via another campaign or source. Currently, visits do not include interactions on our tablet applications.\nWe classify our costs and expenses into six categories: cost of net revenues, product development, sales and marketing, general and administrative, amortization of purchased intangible assets and other operating expenses. We allocate our personnel, facilities and general information technology, or IT, costs, which include IT and facilities-related personnel costs, rent, depreciation and other general costs, to all of the above categories of operating expenses, other than amortization of purchased intangibles and other operating expenses.\nWe also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements.\u201d Of those policies, we believe that the accounting policies discussed below involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of judgment by our management. We evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions on an ongoing basis, and while we believe that our estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.\nThe following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated. The period-to-period comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance that amends the balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs. The guidance requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset. The guidance requires retrospective application and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur effective tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in those jurisdictions, tax credits, state taxes and non-deductible expenses, such as deferred compensation, acquisition costs and stock-based compensation. Our mix of foreign versus U.S. income, our ability to generate tax credits and our incurrence of any non-deductible expenses will likely cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate in the future. Our effective tax rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.\nSales and Marketing\nFinally, we also plan to improve the consistency and reliability of our marketplace by continuing to invest in the development and implementation of certain universal software platforms to support our international websites. We believe this investment has allowed, and will allow in the future, us to more easily and rapidly expand organically in new geographic markets and integrate the systems of any additional digital offering businesses which we may acquire and should result in increased operational efficiency.\nDuring 2015, we used $4.0 million to invest in a non-controlling minority ownership stake in a privately-held marketing technology company in the United States.\n2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, product development expense increased by $17.3 million, or 56.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to a $14.7 million increase in personnel costs. The increase in personnel costs also led to an increase in allocated facilities and IT support costs of $1.6 million. We increased personnel in order to enhance the functionality of, and develop new features and products for, our websites and mobile applications, and to strengthen our reporting and analytics capabilities. Additionally, fees for usability studies and technology licenses used in the design and development of our websites increased by $3.4 million. These increases were partially offset by the capitalization of $2.6 million of internally developed software and website development costs related primarily to infrastructure development to enhance our in-store and advertising products, personalization capabilities and content quality and delivery capabilities.\nBusiness Combinations and the Recoverability of Goodwill and Long-Lived Intangible Assets\nMost of the businesses we have acquired did not have a significant amount of tangible assets. As a result, our acquisitions have resulted in the majority of the purchase price being allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. The long-lived intangible assets we have identified in each acquisition include customer relationships and marketing-related, contract-related and technology-based intangible assets. All of our long-lived intangible assets have a definite life that ranges from one year to 15 years, which we have determined reflects our best estimate of the pattern in which the economic benefit of the related intangible asset will be utilized.\nWe use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimates of a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include:", "item_7_tables": "Table 166: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

report:\n\n- The company's net revenues decreased by 5.9% from $264.7 million in 2014 to $249.1 million in 2015. Net income also decreased by 56.1% from $27.0 million in 2014 to $11.8 million in 2015. \n\n- The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a 20.8% decrease in desktop online transaction revenues, partially offset by increases in mobile online transaction revenues and advertising/in-store revenues.\n\n- Cost of net revenues, product development, and sales & marketing expenses increased in 2015 compared to 2014, while general & administrative expenses decreased. \n\n- Income tax expense decreased significantly, from $19.4 million in 2014 to $9.0 million in 2015, due to a lower effective tax rate.\n\n- The company expects investments in product, team, relationships and technology to enable expansion into new markets. It also plans to improve monetization, especially on mobile.\n\n- Cash flow from operations was $60.5 million in 2015 compared to $61.4 million in 2014.
