Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding our expectation for future performance, liquidity and capital resources, that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include those identified below and those described under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed on March 2, 2020, for a discussion of the comparative results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nManagement's Overview\nWe are the world's largest publicly traded REIT focused on the ownership, operation, acquisition and development of temperature-controlled warehouses. We are organized as a self-administered and self-managed REIT with proven operating, development and acquisition expertise. As of December 31, 2020, we operated a global network of 238 temperature-controlled warehouses encompassing over 1.4 billion cubic feet, with 194 warehouses in North America, 26 in Europe, 15 warehouses in Asia-Pacific, and 3 warehouses in South America. We view and manage our business through three primary business segments: warehouse, third-party managed and transportation. In addition, we hold two minority interests in Brazilian-based joint ventures, one with SuperFrio, which owns or operates 22 temperature-controlled warehouses and one with Comfrio, which owns or operates 13 temperature-controlled warehouses.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nWarehouse. Our primary source of revenues consists of rent, storage and warehouse services fees. Our rent, storage and warehouse services revenues are the key drivers of our financial performance. Rent and storage revenues consist of recurring, periodic charges related to the storage of frozen and perishable food and other products in our warehouses by our customers. We also provide these customers with a wide array of handling and other warehouse services, such as (1) receipt, handling and placement of products into our warehouses for storage and preservation, (2) retrieval of products from storage upon customer request, (3) blast freezing, which involves the rapid freezing of non-frozen products, including individual quick freezing for agricultural produce and seafood, (4) case-picking, which involves selecting product cases to build customized pallets, (5) kitting and repackaging, which involves assembling custom product packages for delivery to retailers and consumers, and labeling services, (6) order assembly and load consolidation, (7) exporting and importing support services, (8) container handling, (9) cross-docking, which involves transferring inbound products to outbound trucks utilizing our warehouse docks without storing them in our warehouses, (10) government-approved temperature-controlled storage and inspection services, (11) fumigation, (12) pre-cooling and cold treatment services, and (13) ripening. We refer to these handling and other warehouse services as our value-added services.\nCost of operations for our warehouse segment consists of power, other facilities costs, labor, and other services costs. Labor, the largest component of the cost of operations from our warehouse segment, consists primarily of employee wages, benefits, and workers' compensation. Trends in our labor expense are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, changes in customer requirements, workforce productivity, variability in costs associated with medical insurance and the impact of workplace safety programs, inclusive of the number and severity of workers' compensation claims. Labor expense is also impacted as a result of discretionary bonuses. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have incorporated certain inefficiencies such as staggered break schedules, social distancing, and other changes to process, all of which we expect to continue\nto incur going forward. Our second largest cost of operations from our warehouse segment is power utilized in the operation of our temperature-controlled warehouses. As a result, trends in the price for power in the regions where we operate may have a significant effect on our financial results. We may from time to time hedge our exposure to changes in power prices through fixed rate agreements or, to the extent possible and appropriate, through rate escalations or power surcharge provisions within our customer contracts. Additionally, business mix impacts power expense depending on the temperature zone or type of freezing required. Other facilities costs include utilities other than power, property insurance, property taxes, sanitation (which include incremental supplies as a result of COVID-19), repairs and maintenance on real estate, rent under real property operating leases, where applicable, security, and other related facilities costs. Other services costs include equipment costs, warehouse consumables (e.g., shrink-wrap and uniforms), personal protective equipment to maintain the health and safety of our associates, warehouse administration and other related services costs.\nThird-Party Managed. We receive a reimbursement of substantially all expenses for warehouses that we manage on behalf of third-party owners, with all reimbursements recognized as revenues under the relevant accounting guidance. We also earn management fees, incentive fees upon achieving negotiated performance and cost-savings results, or an applicable mark-up on costs. Cost of operations for our third-party managed segment is reimbursed on a pass-through basis (typically within two weeks).\nTransportation. We charge transportation fees, including fuel surcharges, to our customers for whom we arrange the transportation of their products. Cost of operations for our transportation segment consists primarily of third-party carrier charges, which are impacted by factors affecting those carriers. Additionally, in connection with the Cloverleaf Acquisition, we acquired trucks and associates that support certain customers within the geographic area. We supplemented our regional, national and truckload consolidation business with the Hall's acquisition, which services the Northeast corridor of the U.S. with an owned and maintained fleet. Our acquisition of Agro Merchants further expands our Transportation service offering. Agro Merchants operates its own fleet of temperature-controlled vehicles in the U.S., Ireland and UK and also offers a variety of non-asset based transportation management services. These include multi-modal global freight forwarding services to support our customers' needs.\nOther. In addition to our primary business segments, we owned and operated a limestone quarry in Carthage, Missouri for the first half of 2020. Revenues were generated from the sale of limestone mined at our quarry. Cost of operations for our quarry consisted primarily of labor, equipment, fuel and explosives. The sale of our quarry business segment was completed on July 1, 2020.\nOther Consolidated Operating Expenses. We also incur depreciation and amortization expenses, corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses and corporate-level acquisition, litigation and other expenses.\nOur depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital-intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to our warehouses, including buildings and improvements, refrigeration equipment, racking, leasehold improvements, material handling equipment, furniture and fixtures, and our computer hardware and software. Amortization relates primarily to intangible assets for customer relationships.\nOur corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, business development, account management, project management, marketing, engineering, supply-chain solutions, human resources and information technology personnel, as well as expenses related to equity incentive plans, communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debt, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses are\ninfluenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels and achievement of incentive compensation targets. To position ourselves to meet the challenges of the current business environment, we have implemented a shared services support structure to better manage costs and enhance the efficiency of our operations.\nOur corporate-level acquisition, litigation and other expenses consist of costs that we view outside of selling, general and administrative expenses with a high level of variability from period-to-period, and include the following:\n\u2022Acquisition related costs include costs associated with transactions, whether consummated or not, such as advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees. We also include integration costs pre- and post-acquisition that reflect work being performed to facilitate merger and acquisition integration, such as employee retention expense and work associated with information systems and other projects including spending to support future acquisitions, which primarily consist of professional services.\n\u2022Litigation costs incurred in order to defend ourselves from litigation charges outside of the normal course of business and related settlement costs.\n\u2022Severance costs representing certain contractual and negotiated severance and separation costs from exited former executives, reduction in headcount due to synergies achieved through acquisitions or operational efficiencies, and reduction in workforce costs associated with exiting or selling non-strategic warehouses.\n\u2022Equity acceleration costs representing the unrecognized expense for share-based awards that vest and convert to common shares in advance of the original negotiated vesting date and any other equity award changes resulting in accounting for the award as a modification.\n\u2022Non-offering related equity issuance expenses whether incurred through our initial public offering, follow-on offerings or secondary offerings.\n\u2022Non-recurring public company implementation costs associated with the implementation of financial reporting systems and processes needed to convert the organization to a public reporting company.\n\u2022Terminated site operations costs represent expenses incurred to return leased sites to their original physical state at lease inception in connection with the termination of the applicable underlying lease. These terminations were part of our strategic efforts to exit or sell non-strategic warehouses as opposed to ordinary course lease expirations. Repair and maintenance expenses associated with our ordinary course operations are reflected as operating expenses on our consolidated statement of operations.\n\u2022Other costs relate to additional superannuation pension costs related to prior years upon review by the Australian Tax Office.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Business and Financial Results\nAcquisitions and Joint Ventures\nOn February 1, 2019, we completed the PortFresh Acquisition for a purchase price of approximately $35.9 million, utilizing available cash on hand. PortFresh consisted of one facility operating near the port of Savannah, Georgia and adjacent land upon which we have constructed a newly developed facility. This newly constructed facility received its certificate of occupancy during the second quarter of 2020. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of the acquired facility within our Warehouse segment.\nOn May 1, 2019, we completed the Cloverleaf Acquisition for a purchase price of approximately $1.24 billion, utilizing the $1.21 billion net proceeds from our April 2019 follow-on offering and cash drawn from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Cloverleaf was the fifth largest temperature-controlled warehousing provider in the United States, based in Sioux City, Iowa and consisted of 22 facilities in nine states. Cloverleaf also generates income through a small component of transportation operations. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of 21 facilities within our warehouse segment, the results of one facility within our third-party managed segment and the results of Cloverleaf's transportation operations within our transportation segment.\nAlso, on May 1, 2019, we completed the Lanier Acquisition for approximately $82.5 million utilizing cash drawn from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Lanier consisted of two temperature-controlled storage facilities in Georgia serving the poultry industry. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of these facilities within our warehouse segment.\nOn November 19, 2019, we completed the MHW Acquisition for a purchase price of approximately $51.6 million, utilizing available cash on hand. MHW consisted of two temperature-controlled storage facilities, one located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania and another in Perryville, Maryland. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of these facilities within our warehouse segment.\nOn January 2, 2020, we completed the purchase of all outstanding shares of Nova Cold for cash consideration of C$338.7 million (USD $260.6 million). Nova Cold consisted of four temperature-controlled facilities in Toronto, Calgary and Halifax. The acquisition was funded utilizing proceeds from the settlement of our April 2019 forward sale agreement combined with funds drawn on our 2018 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of these facilities within our warehouse segment.\nAlso, on January 2, 2020, we completed the purchase of all outstanding membership interests of Newport Cold for cash consideration of $57.7 million, utilizing available cash on hand. Newport Cold consists of a single temperature-controlled warehouse located in St. Paul, Minnesota. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of this facility within our warehouse segment.\nOn March 6, 2020, we acquired a 14.99% ownership interest in Superfrio Armaz\u00e9ns Gerais S.A. (SuperFrio) for Brazil Real Dollars of R$117.8 million, or approximately USD $25.7 million, inclusive of certain legal fees. We funded the purchase price using cash on hand. Our pro-rata share of the Brazil JV's results are included within (Loss) income from investments in partially owned entities\u201d. As of December 31, 2020, SuperFrio owns or operates 22 temperature-controlled warehouses in Brazil.\nOn August 31, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Caspers Cold Storage for cash consideration of approximately $25.6 million, utilizing available cash on hand. Caspers consisted of a single temperature-controlled warehouse located in Tampa, Florida. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of this facility within our warehouse segment.\nAdditionally, on August 31, 2020, we completed the acquisition of AM-C Warehouses for cash consideration of approximately $82.7 million, utilizing available cash on hand. AM-C Warehouses consisted of an owned facility in Mansfield, Texas and a leased facility in Grand Prairie, Texas. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of these facilities within our warehouse segment.\nOn November 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of New Jersey based Halls Warehouse Corporation for $489.2 million. Halls consisted of eight facilities near the Port of Newark. Halls also provides transportation\nservices to its customers. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of the facilities within our warehouse segment, and the results of Halls transportation services within our transportation segment.\nOn December 30, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Agro Merchants for total consideration of $1.59 billion, including cash received of $47.5 million. This was comprised of cash consideration totaling $1.08 billion, of which $49.7 million was deferred, and the issuance of 14,166,667 common shares of beneficial interest to Oaktree, with a fair value of $512.1 million based upon the closing share price on December 29, 2020 of $36.15. Financing lease and sale-leaseback obligations associated with the acquisition totaled $119.9 million, and when added to the total consideration transferred brings the total transaction cost to approximately $1.7 billion. The one business day of results was immaterial to the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. Agro Merchants operates more than 236 million cubic feet of temperature-controlled warehouse and distribution space across 46 facilities and provides transportation services in the United States, Europe, Australia and Chile. We expect to report the results of these facilities within our warehouse segment in 2021, and the results of the transportation operations within our transportation segment in 2021.\nOur results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes the four months for the activity of the AM-C and Caspers acquisitions, and the two months for the activity of the Halls acquisition. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes the one month and partial period of November for the activity of the MHW Acquisition, eight months of activity for the Cloverleaf Acquisition and Lanier Acquisition, and eleven months of activity for the PortFresh Acquisition. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nCOVID-19\nWe are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including how it will impact our customers and business partners. While we have not experienced significant disruptions on our operations from the COVID-19 pandemic thus far, we are unable to predict the future impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties arising from the pandemic. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with any degree of confidence, including the scope, severity, duration and geographies of the outbreak, the actions taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic or mitigate its impact as requested or mandated by governmental authorities or otherwise voluntarily taken by individuals or businesses, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the outbreak and containment measures, among others. Our business is deemed an essential business\u201d as defined by the Department of Homeland Security, which means that our associates are able to continue working in our facilities during shelter-in-place\u201d or stay-at-home\u201d orders. The outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States and other countries in which we operate, has significantly adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has led many nations, states and local authorities to institute shelter-in-place\u201d or stay-at-home\u201d orders, mandate business and school closures and restrict travel. Certain states and cities, including where we own properties, have development sites and where our principal place of business is located, have also reacted by instituting restrictions on travel, shelter in place\u201d rules, restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate, and/or restrictions on the types of construction projects that may continue. Many states and cities have begun implementing reopening\u201d plans, however, these restrictions vary widely by jurisdiction and may continue to change as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses. The negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are pervasive across a broad spectrum of industries, including industries in which we, our customers and business partners operate. Negative impacts from COVID-19 may negatively impact the business and operations of our customers and business partners (including our suppliers). Further, the impacts of a potentially worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets, consumer and business spending as well as other unanticipated consequences continue to remain unknown. The impacts of locations of outbreaks and actions mandated by governmental authorities or taken voluntarily by businesses and individuals to contain or mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and the timing of the repeal or loosening of such restrictions are also unknown. As a result, we cannot at this time predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. Refer to Risk Factors - Risks Related to Public Health Crises - We face various risks and uncertainties related to public health crises, including the recent and ongoing global outbreak of the novel coronavirus and variants (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic is growing and its impacts are uncertain and hard to measure and may have a material adverse effect on us.\nForeign Currency Translation Impact on Our Operations\nOur consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our operations outside the United States. Future fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and their impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations are inherently uncertain. As a result of the relative size of our international operations, these fluctuations may be material on our results of operations. Our revenues and expenses from our international operations are typically denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred. Therefore, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations and margins is partially mitigated.\nThe following table shows a comparison of underlying average exchange rates of the foreign currencies that impacted our U.S. dollar-reported revenues and expenses during the periods discussed herein together with a\ncomparison against the exchange rates of such currencies at the end of the applicable periods presented herein. The rates below represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of one unit of the respective foreign currency. Amounts presented in constant currency within our results of operations are calculated by applying the average foreign exchange rate from the comparable prior year period to actual local currency results in the current period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective period. While constant currency metrics are a non-GAAP calculation and do not represent actual results, the comparison allows the reader to understand the impact of the underlying operations in addition to the impact of changing foreign exchange rates.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign Currency </td> <td> </td> <td>Foreign\nexchange\nrates as of\nDecember 31,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Average foreign exchange rates used to translate actual operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Foreign\nexchange\nrates as of\nDecember 31,\n2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Prior period average\nforeign exchange rate\nused to adjust actual operating results for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Australian dollar </td> <td> </td> <td>0.769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.699 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New Zealand dollar </td> <td> </td> <td>0.718 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.649 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Argentine peso </td> <td> </td> <td>0.012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canadian dollar </td> <td> </td> <td>0.785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Euro(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1.222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>British pound(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1.367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Chilean peso(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>0.141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Poland Zloty(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>0.268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brazilian real(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>0.193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Represents the relevant average foreign exchange rates in effect in the comparable prior period applied to the activity for the current period.

The average rate used for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects the average rate from the date of our initial investment through the end of the year.\nFocus on Our Operational Effectiveness and Cost Structure\nWe continuously seek to execute on various initiatives aimed at streamlining our business processes and reducing our cost structure, including: realigning and centralizing key business processes and fully integrating acquired assets and businesses; implementing standardized operational processes; integrating and launching new information technology tools and platforms; instituting key health, safety, leadership and training programs; and capitalizing on the purchasing power of our network. Through the realignment of our business processes, we have acquired new talent and strengthened our service offerings. In order to reduce costs in our facilities, we have invested in energy efficiency projects, including LED lighting, thermal energy storage, motion-sensor technology, variable frequency drives for our fans and compressors, third party efficiency reviews and real-time monitoring of energy consumption, rapid open and close doors, and alternative-power generation technologies to improve the energy efficiency of our warehouses. We have also performed fine-tuning of our refrigeration systems, deployed efficient energy management practices, such as time-of-use and awareness, and have increased our participation in Power Demand Response programs with some of our power suppliers. These initiatives have allowed us to reduce our consumption of kilowatt hours and energy spend.\nAs part of our initiatives to streamline our business processes and to reduce our cost structure, we have evaluated and exited less strategic and profitable markets or business lines, including the sale of certain warehouse assets, the exit of certain leased facilities, the exit of certain managed warehouse agreements, the sale of our quarry business and the exit of the China JV (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the China JV). Through our process of active portfolio management, we continue to evaluate our markets and offerings.\nStrategic Shift within Our Transportation Segment\nSeveral years ago, we initiated a strategic shift in our transportation segment services and solutions. The intention of this strategic shift was to better focus our business on the operation of our temperature-controlled warehouses. Specifically, we have gradually exited certain commoditized, non-scalable, or low margin services we historically offered to our customers, in favor of more profitable and value-added programs, such as regional, national, truckload and retailer-specific multi-vendor consolidation services. We designed each value-added program to improve efficiency and reduce transportation and logistics costs to our warehouse customers, whose transportation spend typically represents the majority of their supply-chain costs. We believe this efficiency and cost reduction helps to drive increased client retention, as well as maintain high occupancy levels in our temperature-controlled warehouses. Over the last several years, we have made significant progress in implementing our strategic initiative of growing our transportation service offering in a way that complements our temperature-controlled warehouse business, for example, we have also added a dedicated fleet service offering through acquisitions. We intend to continue executing this strategy in the future.\nHistorically Significant Customer\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 one customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues, with revenues received of $257.3 million, $211.1 million and $212.8 million, respectively. The substantial majority of this customer's business relates to our third-party managed segment. We are reimbursed for substantially all expenses we incur in managing warehouses on behalf of third-party owners. We recognize these reimbursements as revenues under applicable accounting guidance, but generally do not affect our financial results because they are offset by the corresponding expenses that we recognize in our third-party managed segment cost of operations. Of the revenues received from this customer, $241.8 million, $195.4 million, and $196.3 million represented reimbursements for certain expenses we incurred during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that were offset by matching expenses included in our third-party managed cost of operations.\nEconomic Occupancy of our Warehouses\nWe define average economic occupancy as the aggregate number of physically occupied pallets and any additional pallets otherwise contractually committed for a given period, without duplication. We estimate the number of contractually committed pallet positions by taking into account the actual pallet commitment specified in each customers' contract, and subtracting the physical pallet positions. We regard economic occupancy as an important driver of our financial results. Historically, providers of temperature-controlled warehouse space have offered storage services to customers on an as-utilized, on-demand basis. We actively seek to enter into contracts that implement our commercial business rules which contemplate, among other things, fixed storage commitments in connection with establishing new customer relationships. Additionally, we actively seek opportunities to transition our current customers to contracts that feature a fixed storage commitment when renewing existing agreements or upon the change in the anticipated profile of our customer. This strategy mitigates the impact of changes in physical occupancy throughout the course of the year due to seasonality, as well as other factors that can impact physical occupancy while ensuring our customers have the necessary space they need to support their business.\nThroughput at our Warehouses\nThe level and nature of throughput at our warehouses is an important factor impacting our warehouse services revenues in our warehouse segment. Throughput refers to the volume of pallets that enter and exit our warehouses. Higher levels of throughput drive warehouse services revenues in our warehouse segment as customers are typically billed on a basis that takes into account the level of throughput of the goods they store in our warehouses. The nature of throughput may be driven by the expected turn of the underlying product or commodity. Throughput pallets can be influenced both by the food manufacturers as well as shifts in demand preferences. Food manufacturers' production levels, which respond to market conditions and consumer preferences, may impact inbound pallets. Similarly, a change in inventory turnover due to shift in customer demand may impact outbound pallets.\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nSegment Contribution (Net Operating Income or NOI\u201d)\nWe evaluate the performance of our primary business segments based on their contribution (NOI) to our overall results of operations. We use the term segment contribution (NOI)\u201d to mean a segment's revenues less its cost of operations (excluding any depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses and corporate-level acquisition, litigation and other expenses). We use segment contribution (NOI) to evaluate our segments for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance in accordance with FASB ASC, Topic 280, Segment Reporting.\nWe also analyze the segment contribution (NOI) margin\u201d for each of our business segments, which we calculate as segment contribution (NOI) divided by segment revenues.\nIn addition to our segment contribution (NOI) and segment contribution (NOI) margin, we analyze the contribution (NOI) of our warehouse rent and storage operations and our warehouse services operations within our warehouse segment. We calculate the contribution (NOI) of our warehouse rent and storage operations as rent and storage revenues less power and other facilities cost. We calculate the contribution (NOI) of our warehouse services operations as warehouse services revenues less labor and other service costs. We calculate the contribution (NOI) margin for each of these operations as the applicable contribution (NOI) measure divided by the applicable revenue measure. We believe the presentation of these contribution (NOI) and contribution (NOI) margin measures helps investors understand the relative revenues, costs and earnings resulting from each of these separate types of services we provide to our customers in the same manner reviewed by our management in connection with the operation of our business. These contribution (NOI) measures within our warehouse segment are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and these measures should be considered as supplements, but not as alternatives, to our results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We provide reconciliations of these measures in the discussions of our comparative results of operations below.\nSame Store Analysis\nWe define our same store\u201d population once a year at the beginning of the current calendar year. Our same store population includes properties that were owned or leased for the entirety of two comparable periods and that have reported at least twelve months of consecutive normalized operations prior to January 1 of the prior calendar year. We define normalized operations\u201d as properties that have been open for operation or lease after development or significant modification, including the expansion of a warehouse footprint or a warehouse rehabilitation subsequent to an event, such as a natural disaster or similar event causing disruption to operations. In addition, our definition of normalized operations\u201d takes into account changes in the ownership structure (e.g., purchase of a previously leased warehouse would result in different charges in the compared periods), which would impact comparability in our warehouse segment contribution (NOI).\nAcquired properties will be included in the same store\u201d population if owned by us as of the first business day of each year, of the prior calendar year and still owned by us as of the end of the current reporting period, unless the property is under development. The same store\u201d pool is also adjusted to remove properties that were sold or entering development subsequent to the beginning of the current calendar year. As such, the same store\u201d population for the period ended December 31, 2020 includes all properties that we owned at January 2, which had both been owned and had reached normalized operations\u201d by January 2, 2019.\nWe calculate same store contribution (NOI)\u201d as revenues for the same store population less its cost of operations (excluding any depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses, corporate-level acquisition, litigation and other expenses and gain or loss on sale of real estate). In order to derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we also calculate our same store contribution (NOI) on a constant currency basis to remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the comparable prior period exchange rate to translate from local currency into U.S. dollars for both periods. We evaluate the performance of the warehouses we own or lease using a same store\u201d analysis, and we believe that same store contribution (NOI) is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it includes the operating performance from the population of properties that is consistent from period to period and also on a constant currency basis, thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of our warehouse portfolio and currency fluctuations on performance measures.\nThe following table shows the number of same-store warehouses in our portfolio and the number of warehouses excluded as same-store warehouses for the year ended December 31, 2020. While not included in the non-same store warehouse count in the table below, the results of operations for the non-same store warehouses includes the partial period impact of the sites that were exited during the year ended December 31, 2020, as described in footnote 2 following the table. In addition, we hold two minority interests in Brazilian-based joint ventures, one with SuperFrio, which owns or operates 22 temperature-controlled warehouses and one with Comfrio, which owns or operates 13 temperature-controlled warehouses; these joint ventures are not included in the table below.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Warehouses </td> <td>238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same Store Warehouses (1)\n</td> <td>135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Same Store Warehouses (1)\n</td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-Party Managed Warehouses (2)\n</td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) At the beginning of 2020 we reclassified one facility in our portfolio to the same store population from the non-same store population as a result of achieving normalized operations, two facilities were reclassified from to our non-same store population from our same store population as a result of the redevelopment impact to the Atlanta Major Market Strategy that is in progress, and one facility that was in the same-store population was sold. During 2020, we acquired four facilities in connection with the Nova Cold Acquisition, one facility in connection with the Newport Acquisition, two facilities in connection with the AM-C Acquisition, one facility in connection with the Caspers Acquisition, eight facilities in connection with the Halls Acquisition and 46 facilities in connection with the Agro Acquisition, all of which were added to the non-same store population. Additionally, during 2020 we completed a development upon land that was acquired in connection with the PortFresh Acquisition, which was added to the non-same store population.\n(2) During 2020, we exited two third-party managed warehouses, which were not renewed upon expiration of the operating agreement.\nSame store contribution (NOI) is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies providing temperature-controlled warehouse storage and handling and other warehouse services may not define same store or calculate same store contribution (NOI) in a manner consistent with our definition or calculation. Same store contribution (NOI) should be considered as a supplement, but not as an alternative, to our results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We provide reconciliations of these measures in the discussions of our comparative results of operations below.\nConstant Currency Metrics\nAs discussed above under Key Factors Affecting Our Business and Financial Results-Foreign Currency Translation Impact on Our Operations,\u201d our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations outside our control that are caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues generated and expenses incurred by our operations outside the United States. As a result, in order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we analyze our business performance based on certain constant currency reporting that represents current period results translated into U.S. dollars at the relevant average foreign exchange rates applicable in the comparable prior period. We believe that the presentation of constant currency results provides a measurement of our ongoing operations that is meaningful to investors because it excludes the impact of these foreign currency movements that we cannot control. Constant currency results are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and our constant currency results should be considered as a supplement, but not as an alternative, to our results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The constant currency performance measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We provide reconciliations of these measures in the discussions of our comparative results of operations below. Our discussion of the drivers of our performance below are based upon U.S. GAAP.\nSEC Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses\nIn May 2020, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC release No. 33-10786, Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses, amending Rule 1-02(w)(2) which includes amendments to certain of its rules and forms related to the disclosure of financial information regarding acquired or disposed businesses. Among other changes, the amendments impact SEC rules relating to (1) the definition of significant\u201d subsidiaries, (2) requirements to provide financial statements for significant\u201d acquisitions, and (3) revisions to the formulation and usage of pro forma financial information. The final rule is effective on January 1, 2021; however, voluntary early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted the provisions of the final rule in the third quarter of 2020. We have applied the new rules to the contemplated and completed acquisitions since the date of adoption. The Agro acquisition met the SEC's revised definition of significance, requiring one year of audited financial statements and pro forma financial information and was filed on Form 8-K/A on February 26, 2021.\nPresentation\nA detailed discussion of the 2020 year-over-year changes can be found below and a detailed discussion of the 2019 year-over-year changes can be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 2, 2020.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Results for the

December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, our warehouse segment revenue was $1.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $177.7 million, or 12.9%, compared to the prior year. Approximately $158.7 million of the increase, on an actual basis, was primarily driven by acquisitions completed during 2019 and 2020, including the growth experienced period-over-period during overlapping periods of ownership. We acquired 23 warehouse facilities as a result of the Cloverleaf and Lanier acquisitions on May 1, 2019, two facilities in connection with the MHW acquisition on November 19, 2019 and one facility as a result of the PortFresh acquisition on February 1, 2019, and therefore did not have ownership of these facilities during the entirety of the comparable prior period. In 2020, we acquired 62 facilities in the warehouse segment in the Agro, AM-C, Caspers, Halls, Newport and Nova Cold acquisitions. Agro's revenue is not reflected in the operating results of our warehouse segment as the\nacquisition closed on December 30, 2020 with only one day of results for the year ended December 31, 2020. We consider the results to be immaterial and have excluded it for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThroughout 2020, revenue growth has been driven by the impact of acquisitions. Additionally, we experienced higher than seasonal grocery demand within the retail sector due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this was mostly offset by decreased consumption in the food services sector due to stay-at-home orders and continued social distancing which resulted in lower services revenue due to the shift in demand. Later in the second quarter of 2020, the food service sector volumes began to increase as re-opening plans were implemented but still significantly lower than the prior comparable period. The increase was also partially due to higher economic occupancy in our same-store pool from higher commodity holdings and a slowdown in food service activity and exports, coupled with an increase in fixed committed contracts. The remaining increase was primarily due to a more favorable customer mix, improvements in our commercial terms and contractual rate escalations, the incremental revenue from our expansion of the Rochelle, Illinois facility and the opening of the development in Savannah. The foreign currency translation of revenue received by our foreign operations had a $5.6 million unfavorable impact during the year ended December 31, 2020, which was mainly driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the Australian dollar and to a lesser extent the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the Argentine peso.\nWarehouse segment cost of operations was $1.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $99.4 million, or 10.7%, compared to $929.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, our warehouse segment cost of operations was $1.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $103.4 million, or 11.1%, compared to the prior year. Approximately $97.8 million of the increase, on an actual basis,was primarily driven by the additional facilities we acquired in connection with the aforementioned acquisitions. In addition, we incurred increases in our cost of operations in response to COVID-19. We undertook initiatives to ensure the health and safety of our associates, incurring higher costs for items such as labor, due to social distancing requirements, cleaning and sanitation supplies, and other personal protective equipment ( PPE\u201d). These incremental COVID-19 expenses include higher sanitation costs of $3.2 million and higher PPE costs of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, we experienced higher property taxes and property insurance expense during 2020, due primarily to our growing portfolio. During the second quarter of 2020, we also paid a front-line appreciation bonus to our associates in recognition of their dedication and efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic, which totaled $4.3 million. The foreign currency translation of expenses incurred by our foreign operations had a $4.0 million favorable impact during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWarehouse segment contribution (NOI) was $520.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $72.7 million, or 16.3%, compared to $447.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, warehouse segment contribution was $521.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $74.3 million, or 16.6%, compared to the prior year. The foreign currency translation of our results of operations had a $1.6 million unfavorable impact to the warehouse segment contribution period-over-period. The increase was primarily driven by the additional facilities in the warehouse segment as a result of the aforementioned acquisitions, including the growth and synergies experienced period-over-period during overlapping periods of ownership. The remainder of the increase was driven by improvements in our core business, same store economic occupancy growth, and disciplined cost controls through the Americold Operating System of our power and other services costs, which allowed us to generate higher contribution margins. The increases were partially offset by the currency translation impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the appreciation bonus paid to front-line associates to recognize the efforts of our associates during the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in the cost of property taxes and property insurance, as well as the increase in costs related to the COVID-19 response efforts to maintain the health and safety of our associates.\nSame Store Analysis\nWe had 135 same stores for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

We estimate the number of contractually committed pallet positions by taking into account actual pallet commitment specified in each customers' contract, and subtracting the physical pallet positions.\n(2)We define average physical occupancy as the average number of occupied pallets divided by the estimated number of average physical pallet positions in our warehouses for the applicable period. We estimate the number of physical pallet positions by taking into account actual racked space and by estimating unracked space on an as-if racked basis. We base this estimate on a formula utilizing the total cubic feet of each room within the warehouse that is unracked divided by the volume of an assumed rack space that is\nconsistent with the characteristics of the relevant warehouse. On a warehouse by warehouse basis, rack space generally ranges from three to four feet depending upon the type of facility and the nature of the customer goods stored therein. The number of our pallet positions is reviewed and updated quarterly, taking into account changes in racking configurations and room utilization.\n(3)Non-same store warehouse count of 94 includes 46 warehouses acquired through the Agro acquisition on December 30, 2020, eight warehouses acquired through the Hall's acquisition on November 2, 2020, three warehouses acquired through the Casper's and AM-C warehouse acquisitions on August 31, 2020, and five warehouses acquired through the Nova Cold and Newport acquisitions on January 2, 2020. The results of these acquisitions are reflected in the results above since date of ownership. The operational results from one day of ownership of the Agro warehouses is immaterial to the three months and year ended December 31, 2020.\nEconomic occupancy at our same stores was 80.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 110 basis points compared to 79.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This change was primarily the result of an increase in fixed storage contracts. Our economic occupancy at our same stores for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 781 basis points higher than our corresponding average physical occupancy of 72.7%. The decrease of 265 basis points in average physical occupancy compared to 75.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 was partially driven by lower protein occupancy and lower food service business occupancy due to stay-at-home\u201d orders as well as port congestion as a result of COVID-19, which generated lower throughput of inventory within our warehouses. This was partially offset by the increase in physical occupancy related to the retail products as a result of higher grocery demand related to COVID-19.\nSame store rent and storage revenues per economic occupied pallet increased 1.3% period-over-period, primarily driven by improvements in our commercial terms and contractual rate escalations. On a constant currency basis, our same store rent and storage revenues per occupied pallet increased 1.8% period-over-period.\nThroughput pallets at our same stores were 25.1 million pallets for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of 2.7% from 25.8 million pallets for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was the result of the COVID related impacts in various sectors and commodities, including the initial surge and ongoing elevated demand from our grocery retail sector, offset by the decrease in throughput in the food service sector and protein commodity. Same store warehouse services revenue per throughput pallet increased 4.1% compared to the prior year primarily as a result of contractual rate escalations, favorable business mix and an increase in higher-priced, value-added warehouse services such as repackaging, blast freezing, and case-picking, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation as previously discussed. On a constant currency basis, our same store services revenue per throughput pallet increased 4.4% compared to the prior year.\nThird-Party Managed Segment\nThe following table presents the operating results of our third-party managed segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 actual </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 constant currency(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 actual </td> <td> </td> <td>Actual </td> <td> </td> <td>Constant currency </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of managed sites </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party managed revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>291,751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>292,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>252,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party managed cost of operations </td> <td>279,523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>279,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>241,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>16.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party managed segment contribution </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party managed margin </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>-46 bps </td> <td> </td> <td>-47 bps </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The adjustments from our U.S. GAAP operating results to calculate our operating results on a constant currency basis are the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the comparable prior period.\nThird-party managed revenue was $291.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $38.8 million, or 15.3%, compared to $252.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, third-party managed revenue was $292.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $39.1 million, or 15.5%, compared to the prior year. This increase was a result of higher business volume in our domestic and Australia managed operations due to the consumer demand shift to retail. This increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation related to our Canadian and Australian managed revenues, and the impacts from the exit of two Canadian managed facilities during 2020 and the exit of one domestic managed facility during the third quarter of 2019.\nThird-party managed cost of operations was $279.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $38.3 million, or 15.9%, compared to $241.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, third-party managed cost of operations was $279.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $38.6 million, or 16.0%, compared to the prior year. The increase was a result of higher business volume and is in line with the increase in revenues, partially offset by the exit of the facilities described above.\nThird-party managed segment contribution (NOI) was $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $0.5 million, or 4.0%, compared to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Transportation revenue was $142.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 1.8%, compared to $144.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, transportation revenue was $143.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1.1\nmillion, or 0.8%, compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by the exit of certain low-margin international and domestic transportation business, paired with the unfavorable impact from the foreign currency translation of revenues earned by our foreign operations. Domestically, our transportation operations experienced an increase due to the revenue associated with transportation operations from the Hall's acquisition, which closed on November 2, 2020, and resulted in an increase of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, revenue increased from the Cloverleaf Acquisition, which contributed an increase of $2.0 million due to 12 months of results during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to eight months of ownership during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTransportation cost of operations was $123.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $3.4 million, or 2.7%, compared to $126.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, transportation cost of operations was $124.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 1.6%, compared to the prior year. Domestically, our transportation cost of operations experienced an increase due to the cost associated with transportation operations from the Hall's acquisition, which closed on November 2, 2020, and resulted in an increase of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, cost of operations increased from the Cloverleaf Acquisition, which contributed an increase of $1.2 million due to 12 months of results during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to eight months of ownership during the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding the increases in transportation cost of operations resulting from the aforementioned acquisitions, the strategic shift referenced above, paired with the impact of the foreign currency translation of our international costs, led to a decline in transportation cost of operations for the segment.\nTransportation segment contribution (NOI) was $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $0.7 million, or 4.1%, compared to $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Transportation segment margin increased 75 basis points from the prior year, to 13.2% from 12.5%. On a constant currency basis, transportation segment contribution was $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $0.9 million, or 5.0%, compared to the prior year. The overall increase in margin was primarily due to the strategic shift referenced above, which resulted in more profitable business.\nQuarry Segment\nThe following table presents the operating results of our quarry segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We sold our quarry business on July 1, 2020.\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarry revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48.8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarry cost of operations </td> <td>4,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarry segment contribution (NOI) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(84.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarry margin </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>670 bps </td> </tr>\n</table>\nQuarry revenue was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $4.2 million, or 48.8%, compared to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Quarry cost of operations was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $3.5 million, or 45.0%, compared to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in both revenues and cost of operations was a result of the sale of the limestone quarry which closed on July 1, 2020.\nQuarry segment contribution (NOI) was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to the sale of the quarry segment.\nOther Consolidated Operating Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $215.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $52.5 million, or 32.2%, compared to $163.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the 2019 and 2020 acquisitions, expansions and developments.\nSelling, general and administrative. Corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses were $144.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $15.4 million, or 11.9%, compared to $129.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Included in these amounts are business development expenses attributable to new business pursuits, supply chain solutions and underwriting, facility development, customer onboarding, and engineering and consulting services to support our customers in the cold chain. Business development expenses represented approximately 13% and 14% of corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe these costs are comparable to leasing costs for other publicly-traded REITs. The increase in corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher share-based compensation and higher payroll and benefits related to additional investments to support our expanded development pipeline and higher professional fees. This was offset by a reduction in travel expense due to stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, paired with net synergies realized from acquisitions. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.3% and 7.2%, respectively, of total revenues.\nAcquisition, litigation and other. Corporate-level acquisition, litigation and other expenses were $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $4.3 million compared to $40.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Included in these amounts are business acquisition related costs, litigation costs associated with litigation charges outside of the normal course of business or resulting from a settlement, severance and equity acceleration costs incurred in connection with former executives, severance as a result of synergies realized from acquisitions or operational realignment, non-offering related equity issuance expenses, and terminated site operations costs. We view all of these costs as corporate in nature regardless of the segment or segments involved in certain transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $26.5 million of acquisition related expenses primarily composed of professional fees and integration related costs in connection with completed and potential acquisitions, primarily related to the recently completed Agro Merchants Acquisition, and employee retention. Additionally, we incurred $1.1 million of severance primarily related to reduction in headcount as a result of the synergies from acquisitions, and partially related to the realignment of our international operations. During the fourth quarter of 2020 we were subject to a cybersecurity incident and incurred $7.9 million of costs related to it. The cyber incident costs include third-party fees incurred in connection with the cyber incident that occurred in November 2020, as well as any incremental costs, internal and external, incurred to restore operations at our facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $24.3 million of acquisition related expenses primarily composed of professional fees and integration related costs in connection with completed and potential acquisitions, primarily related to the Cloverleaf Acquisition, and employee retention. In addition, we incurred $4.3 million of severance and equity acceleration expenses related to exited former executives and the resignation of a member of the Board of Trustees and $5.4 million of severance related to reduction in headcount as a result of the synergies created from the Cloverleaf and Lanier acquisitions and organizational realignment of our international operations. We also incurred $4.6 million of legal settlement and related litigation professional fees and $1.4 million of costs in connection with the secondary offering of\ncommon shares on behalf of our previously significant shareholders in March 2019, for which we received no proceeds.\nImpairment of long-lived assets. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded impairment charges of $8.2 million and $13.5 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded impairment charges of $3.7 million for Quarry segment assets related to the sale of our quarry business, $2.1 million for Third-party managed segment assets within the leased facilities that we exited which could not be repurposed, $1.7 million for Warehouse segment assets related to a potential development project which we are no longer moving forward with and $0.5 million for Warehouse segment assets which were deemed unusable subsequent to the sale of our Boston facility. During the first quarter of 2019, management and our Board of Trustees formally approved the Atlanta Major Market Strategy\u201d plan which included the partial redevelopment of an existing warehouse facility. The partial redevelopment required the demolition of 75% of the current warehouse. As a result of this initiative, we recorded an impairment charge of $9.6 million during the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $2.9 million related to a domestic idle warehouse facility in anticipation of sale of the asset, which was completed during the second quarter of 2019. Each of these impaired assets previously mentioned related to the Warehouse segment. In addition, during the second quarter of 2019, management determined that certain international transportation related assets were going to be idled and we recorded an impairment charge of $0.9 million as a result. These impaired assets related to the transportation segment.\nGain from sale of real estate. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $22.1 million gain from the sale of real estate. On June 19, 2020, we completed the sale of a facility in our Warehouse segment, and began to transition the business to other nearby facilities, resulting in a $20.1 million gain from sale of real estate. On January 31, 2020, we received official notice from a customer to exercise its contractual call option to purchase land from us in Sydney, Australia, which we previously purchased for future development. We received sale proceeds upon exercise of the call option during the first quarter of 2020, resulting in a $2.5 million gain on sale.\nOther Expense\nThe following table presents other items of income and expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expense) income: </td> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(91,481) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(94,408) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td>1,162 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(81.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bridge loan commitment fees </td> <td>(2,438) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,665) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on debt extinguishment, modifications and termination of derivative instruments </td> <td>(9,975) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency exchange (loss) gain, net </td> <td>(45,278) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/r </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense - net </td> <td>(2,563) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,870) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from partially owned entities </td> <td>(250) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(111) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain from sale of partially owned entities </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>n/r= not relevant </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 3.1%, compared to $94.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in interest expense on the unhedged portion of our Senior Unsecured Term Loan A\nFacility due to the decrease in the LIBOR rate. This was offset by the increase in the Senior Unsecured Term Loan A which was expanded to fund the Nova Cold acquisition and the private placement of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of Series C Senior Unsecured Notes on May 7, 2019, which were used to fund a portion of the Cloverleaf and Lanier acquisitions. While our average outstanding principal has increased from the comparable prior period, on average, the effective interest rate of our outstanding debt has decreased from 4.79% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 3.94% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest income. Interest income of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $5.1 million when compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This change was primarily driven by a lower interest rate of 0.51% earned during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2.3% during the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as a lower average cash balance as compared to the prior year.\nBridge loan commitment fees. Corporate-level bridge loan commitment fees were $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2020 and 2019, we obtained a bridge loan to support the Agro and Cloverleaf acquisitions, respectively. The bridge loan facility for Agro and Cloverleaf ultimately did not need to be funded, and accordingly, we expensed the lender commitment and loan fee.\nLoss on debt extinguishment, modifications and termination of derivative instruments. During the first quarter of 2020 we refinanced our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, which resulted in the write-off of certain unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.8 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we closed on a debt private placement of \u20ac750 million senior unsecured notes. In connection with this issuance, we repaid $100.0 million of our outstanding Senior Unsecured Term Loan A-1 facility, resulting in a write-off of $1.5 million of unamortized deferred financing costs. In connection with the partial repayment of this debt we also terminated the related interest rate swaps, resulting in the recognition of a portion of the remaining unamortized balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the previously designated hedges for $7.7 million. The unamortized balance of $8.7 million will be recognized through 2024. No such costs were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nForeign currency exchange (loss) gain, net. We reported a foreign currency exchange loss of $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a nominal gain for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company entered into an undesignated foreign currency forward contract to lock in the conversion of the expected proceeds of the \u20ac750 million denominated debt issuance to USD, which settled on December 30, 2020, and resulted in $45.0 million in foreign currency exchange loss when compared to the USD equivalent of the Euro denominated debt at market rates, on the date of issuance.\nOther expense - net. Other expense, net was $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $0.7 million was primarily driven by the loss on asset disposal that was offset by a decrease in pension non-service costs.\nLoss from partially owned entities. We reported a loss of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a loss of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into the Brazil JV for which we recorded our portion of loss generated by SuperFrio. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the loss related to the China JV, which we exited during the third quarter of 2019.\nGain from sale of partially owned entities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold our interest in the China JV which resulted in the $4.3 million gain.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6.9 million, which represented an increase of $1.7 million, from an income tax benefit of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to recognition by our U.S. TRS of a deferred income tax benefit to reduce its valuation allowance by $2.0 million. The reduction in the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to net deferred tax liabilities acquired that are a positive source of income for valuation allowance assessment purposes. This deferred income tax benefit was offset by an increase in income tax expense of $0.3 million primarily attributable to our foreign operations.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use the following non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental performance measures of our business: FFO, Core FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDAre and Core EBITDA.\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>We calculate funds from operations, or FFO, in accordance with the standards established by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding extraordinary items as defined under U.S. GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, real estate asset impairment and our share of reconciling items for partially owned entities. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it excludes the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs, which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>We calculate core funds from operations, or Core FFO, as FFO adjusted for the effects of gain or loss on the sale of non-real estate assets, non-real estate impairment, acquisition, litigation and other, share-based compensation expense for the IPO retention grants, bridge loan commitment fees, loss on debt extinguishment, modifications and termination of derivative instruments, foreign currency exchange loss and gain from sale of partially owned entities. We also adjust for the impact of Core FFO attributable to partially owned entities. We have elected to reflect our share of Core FFO attributable to partially owned entities since the Brazil JV is a strategic partnership which we continue to actively participate in on an ongoing basis. The previous joint venture, the China JV, was considered for disposition during the periods presented. We believe that Core FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it excludes the effects of certain items which can create significant earnings volatility, but which do not directly relate to our core business operations. We believe Core FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods, while also providing a more meaningful predictor of future earnings potential. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>However, because FFO and Core FFO add back real estate depreciation and amortization and do not capture the level of maintenance capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, both of which have material economic impacts on our results from operations, we believe the utility of FFO and Core FFO as a measure of our performance may be limited. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>We calculate adjusted funds from operations, or Adjusted FFO, as Core FFO adjusted for the effects of amortization of deferred financing costs, pension withdrawal liability and above or below market leases, straight-line net rent, provision or benefit from deferred income taxes, share-based compensation expense from grants of stock options and restricted stock units under our equity incentive plans, excluding IPO grants, non-real estate depreciation and amortization, and maintenance capital expenditures. We also adjust for AFFO attributable to our share of reconciling items of partially owned entities. We believe that Adjusted FFO is helpful to investors as a meaningful supplemental comparative performance measure of our ability to make incremental capital investments in our business and to assess our ability to fund distribution requirements from our operating activities. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO should be evaluated along with U.S. GAAP net income and net income per diluted share (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures) in evaluating our operating performance. FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO do not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are not indicative of our results of operations or cash flows from operating activities as disclosed in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO should be considered as supplements, but not alternatives, to our net income or cash flows from operating activities as indicators of our operating performance. Moreover, other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or may interpret the NAREIT definition differently than we do. Accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to FFO as calculated by other REITs. In addition, there is no industry definition of Core FFO or Adjusted FFO and, as a result, other REITs may also calculate Core FFO or Adjusted FFO, or other similarly-captioned metrics, in a manner different than we do. The table below reconciles FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable

The rule is effective January 4, 2021 but earlier compliance is permitted. The Company and the Operating Partnership have filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC registering, among other securities, debt securities of the Operating Partnership, which will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. As a result of the amendments to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, subsidiary issuers of obligations guaranteed by the parent are not required to provide separate financial statements, provided that the subsidiary obligor is consolidated into the parent company's consolidated financial statements, the parent guarantee is full and unconditional\u201d and, subject to certain exceptions as set forth below, the alternative disclosure required by Rule 13-01 is provided, which includes narrative disclosure and summarized financial information. Accordingly, separate consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership have not been presented. Furthermore, as permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi), the Company has excluded the summarized financial information for the Operating Partnership as the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company and the Operating Partnership are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and not provide incremental value to investors.\nWe currently expect that our principal sources of funding for working capital, facility acquisitions, business combinations, expansions, maintenance and renovation of our properties, developments projects, debt service and distributions to our shareholders will include:\n\u2022current cash balances;\n\u2022cash flows from operations;\n\u2022our outstanding equity forward sale agreements;\n\u2022our 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility;\n\u2022our ATM Equity Program and related forward sale agreements; and\n\u2022other forms of debt financings and equity offerings.\nWe expect that our funding sources as noted above are adequate and will continue to be adequate to meet our short-term liquidity requirements and capital commitments. These liquidity requirements and capital commitments include:\n\u2022operating activities and overall working capital;\n\u2022capital expenditures;\n\u2022debt service obligations; and\n\u2022quarterly shareholder distributions.\nWe expect to utilize the same sources of capital we will rely on to meet our short-term liquidity requirements to also meet our long-term liquidity requirements, which include funding our operating activities, our debt service obligations and shareholder distributions, and our future development and acquisition activities. As previously discussed, the COVID-19 pandemic has created disruption among several industries. The outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. While we did not incur significant disruption during the year ended December 31, 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to predict the impact that the pandemic may have on the sources of capital upon which we rely.\nWe are a well-known seasoned issuer with an effective shelf registration statement filed on April 16, 2020, which registered an indeterminate amount of common shares, preferred shares, depositary shares and warrants, as well as debt securities of the Operating Partnership, which will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us. As circumstances warrant, we may issue equity securities from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. We may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, the funding of development, expansion and acquisition opportunities and to increase working capital.\nOn August 26, 2019, we entered into an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate sales price of $500.0 million of our common shares through an ATM equity program (an ATM Equity Program\u201d). There were no common shares sold under the ATM Equity Program during the first quarter of 2020. On April 16, 2020, this ATM Equity Program was terminated and replaced with a new ATM Equity Program, pursuant to which we may sell up to an aggregate sales price of $500.0 million of our common shares. Sales of our common shares made pursuant to the ATM Equity Program may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be at the market\u201d offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the NYSE, or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange, or as otherwise agreed between the applicable agent and us. Sales may also be made on a forward basis pursuant to separate forward sale agreements. We intend to use any net proceeds from sales of our common shares pursuant to the new ATM Equity Program for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, which may include funding development, expansion and acquisitions opportunities and the repayment of outstanding indebtedness.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, there were 7,440,532 common shares sold under the 2020 ATM Equity Program, resulting in gross proceeds of $272.6 million. The proceeds were offset by $3.0 million of fees. Included in the shares sold under the 2020 ATM Equity Program were forward sale agreements to sell 4,346,101 common shares for gross proceeds of $162.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company settled 5,011,428 common shares for gross proceeds of $183.0 million under its ATM equity program. Pursuant to the respective forward sale agreements, the remaining 2,428,604 of shares must be settled by September 1, 2021 for gross proceeds of $89.6 million.\nAfter considering the common shares issued during 2020 and the shares subject to the forward sale agreements, the Company had approximately $227.4 million of availability remaining for distribution under the 2020 ATM Equity Program as of December 31, 2020.\nSecurity Interests in Customers' Products\nBy operation of law and in accordance with our customer contracts (other than leases), we typically receive warehouseman's liens on products held in our warehouses to secure customer payments. Such liens permit us to take control of the products and sell them to third parties in order to recover any monies receivable on a delinquent account, but such products may be perishable or otherwise not available to us for re-sale. Historically, in instances where we have warehouseman's liens and our customer sought bankruptcy protection, we have been successful in receiving critical vendor\u201d status, which has allowed us to fully collect on our accounts receivable during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceeding.\nOur bad debt expense was $1.6 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we maintained bad debt allowances of approximately $12.3 million, which we believed to be adequate.\nDividends and Distributions\nWe are required to distribute 90% of our taxable income (excluding capital gains) on an annual basis in order to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to shareholders from cash flows from our operating activities. While historically we have satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to our shareholders, we may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property. All such distributions are at the discretion of our Board of Trustees. We consider market factors and our performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining distribution levels. We have distributed at least 100% of our taxable income annually since inception to minimize corporate-level federal income taxes. Amounts accumulated for distribution to shareholders are invested primarily in interest-bearing accounts and short-term interest-bearing securities, which are consistent with our intention to maintain our status as a REIT.\nAs a result of this distribution requirement, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies which are not REITs can. We may need to continue to raise capital in the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, as well as potential developments in new or existing properties, acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures. In addition, we may be required to use borrowings under our revolving credit facility, if necessary, to meet REIT distribution requirements and maintain our REIT status.\nWe declared the following

The proceeds were used to refinance the existing $800 million 2018 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility maturing January 23, 2021 and USD denominated $475 million 2018 Senior Unsecured Term Loan maturing January 23, 2023. The total borrowing capacity of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is approximately $1.4 billion USD. The Company reduced the margin on 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility and 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility by five basis points.\nThe 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility is broken into two tranches. Tranche A-1 is comprised of a $425.0 million USD term loan and Tranche A-2 is comprised of a CAD $250.0 million term loan, both are five-year loans maturing in 2025. Tranche A-2 provides a natural hedge for the Company's investment in the recently completed Nova Cold acquisition. We refer to Tranches A-1 and A-2 in aggregate as the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan Facility. In connection with entering into the agreement, we incurred approximately $3.2 million of debt issuance costs related to the term loan, which we amortize as interest expense under the effective interest method. As of December 31, 2020, $5.6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility are included in Mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and term loan\u201d in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe maturity of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility is March 26, 2024, with the option to extend the maturity up to two times, each for a six-month period. In order to extend, the Company must not be in default, all representations and warranties must be in effect, obtain updated resolutions from loan parties, and an additional 6.25 bps extension fee must be paid. In connection with entering into the agreement, we incurred approximately $5.2 million of debt issuance costs for the 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which we amortize as interest expense under the straight-line method. Unamortized deferred financing costs as of December 31, 2019 of $2.8 million will continue to be amortized over the life of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, $5.8 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the revolving credit facility are included in Other assets\u201d in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nOn December 30, 2020, we repaid $100.0 million of the 425000000 USD Tranche A-1 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A. This was funded using the Series D and E debt private placement issuance, more details on this debt issuance can be found under the Series A, B, C, D, and E Senior Unsecured Notes\u201d section below. In connection with this repayment, approximately $1.5 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility were written off. In addition, the interest rate swaps associated with the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A were terminated, resulting in an extinguishment fee of $16.4 million. After accounting for the refinance, the total borrowing capacity of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is approximately $1.3 billion USD.\nOur 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility contains representations, covenants and other terms customary for a publicly traded REIT. In addition, it contains certain financial covenants, as defined in the credit agreement, including:\n\u2022a maximum leverage ratio of less than or equal to 60% of our total asset value. Following a material acquisition, leverage ratio shall not exceed 65%;\n\u2022a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio of less than or equal to 60% to unencumbered asset value. Following a material acquisition, unencumbered leverage ratio shall not exceed 65%;\n\u2022a maximum secured leverage ratio of less than or equal to 40% to total asset value. Following a material acquisition, secured leverage ratio shall not exceed 45%;\n\u2022a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of greater than or equal to 1.50x; and\n\u2022a minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio of greater than or equal to 1.75x.\nMaterial Acquisition in our 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is defined as one in which assets acquired exceeds an amount equal to 5% of total asset value as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter publicly available. Obligations under our 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility are general unsecured obligations of our Operating Partnership and are guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.\nThere were $21.7 million letters of credit issued on the Company's 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020.\n2018 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility\nOn December 4, 2018, we entered into the 2018 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility to, among other things, (i) increase the revolver borrowing capacity from $450 million to $800 million, (ii) convert the credit facility (term loan and revolver) from a secured credit facility to an unsecured credit facility, and (iii) decrease the applicable interest rate margins from 2.35% to 1.45% and decrease the fee on unused borrowing capacity by 5 basis points. The terms of the revolver allow for the ability to draw proceeds in multiple currencies, up to $400 million. In connection with entering into the original agreement and subsequent amendments for the Term Loan A Credit Facility, we incurred approximately $8.9 million of debt issuance costs, which we amortize as interest expense under the effective interest method. As of December 31, 2019, the unamortized balance of Term Loan A debt issuance costs was $6.1 million and was included in Mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and term loans\u201d on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn September 24, 2019, we reduced our interest rate margins from 1.45% to 1.00% and decreased the fee on unused borrowing capacity by 5 basis points for usage greater than 50% of the total commitment and 15 basis points for usage less than 50% of commitment. The fee for unused borrowing capacity was 20 basis points regardless of the percentage of total commitment used. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company received a favorable credit rating. This rating, when combined with existing ratings, allowed the Company to transition to a favorable ratings-based pricing grid during the third quarter of 2019.\nThere were $23.0 million letters of credit issued on the Company's 2018 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2019.

The Company must give each lender at least 10 days written notice whenever it intends to prepay any portion of the debt.\nIf a change in control occurs for us, we must issue an offer to prepay the remaining portion of the debt to the lenders. The prepayment amount will be 100% of the principal amount, as well as accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe Senior Unsecured Notes require compliance with leverage ratios, secured and unsecured indebtedness ratios, and unsecured indebtedness to qualified assets ratios. In addition, we are required to maintain at all times a credit rating for each series of notes from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The 2018 Senior Unsecured Notes agreement includes the following financial covenants:\n\u2022a maximum leverage ratio of less than or equal to 60% of our total asset value;\n\u2022a maximum unsecured indebtedness to qualified assets ratio of less than 0.60 to 1.00;\n\u2022a maximum total secured indebtedness ratio of less than 0.40 to 1.00;\n\u2022a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of greater than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00; and\n\u2022a minimum unsecured debt service ratio of greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\n2013 Mortgage Loans\nOn May 1, 2013, we entered into a mortgage financing in an aggregate principal amount of $322.0 million, which we refer to as the 2013 Mortgage Loans. The debt consists of a senior debt note and two mezzanine notes. The components are cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted. The senior debt note requires monthly principal payments. The mezzanine notes require no principal payments until the stated maturity date in May 2023. The interest rates on the notes are fixed and range from 3.81% to 11.50% per annum. The senior debt note and the two mezzanine notes remain subject to yield maintenance provisions. We used the net proceeds of these loans to refinance certain of the 2006 Mortgage Loans, acquire two warehouses, and fund general corporate purposes.\nThe 2013 Mortgage Loans are collateralized by 15 warehouses. The terms governing the 2013 Mortgage Loans require us to maintain certain cash amounts in accounts that are restricted as to their use for the respective warehouses. As of December 31, 2020, the amount of restricted cash associated with the 2013 Mortgage Loans was $3.6 million. Additionally, if we do not maintain certain financial thresholds, including a debt service coverage ratio of 1.10x, the cash generated will further be temporarily restricted and limited to the use for scheduled debt service and operating costs. The 2013 Mortgage Loans are non-recourse to us subject to customary non-recourse carve-outs.\nThe 2013 Mortgage Loans also require compliance with other financial covenants, including a debt coverage ratio and cash flow calculation, as defined.\nDebt Covenants\nOur Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities, the Senior Unsecured Notes and 2013 Mortgage Loans all require financial statement reporting, periodic reporting of compliance with financial covenants, other established thresholds and performance measurements, and compliance with affirmative and negative covenants that govern our allowable business practices. The affirmative and negative covenants include continuation of insurance, maintenance of collateral, the maintenance of REIT status, and our ability to enter into certain types of transactions or exposures in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nLoss on debt extinguishment, modifications and termination of derivative instruments\nIn connection with the early repayment of a portion of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility during the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recorded $1.5 million to Loss on debt extinguishment and modifications\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, representing the write-off of the proportionate unamortized deferred financing costs from the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. In addition, the Company terminated the two interest rate swaps related to the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility for a fee of $16.4 million. Approximately $8.7 million of this fee will remain in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\u201d and will be amortized to expense through 2024, while $7.7 million was expensed to Loss on debt extinguishment, modifications, and termination of derivative instruments\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn connection with the refinancing of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility during the first quarter of 2020 the Company recorded $0.8 million to Loss on debt extinguishment and modifications\u201d in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, representing the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs from the 2018 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. These write-offs were a result of two lenders in the 2018\nSenior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility that did not participate in the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility, accordingly those lenders' portion of unamortized deferred financing costs were written off. Similarly, two lenders in the 2018 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility did not participate in the 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, and those lender's portions of unamortized deferred financing costs were written off.\nCredit Ratings\nOur capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from three nationally recognized credit rating agencies. We have investment grade ratings of BBB with a stable outlook from Fitch, BBB with an Under Review with Positive Implications outlook from DBRS Morningstar, and an investment grade rating of Baa3 with a stable outlook from Moody's. These credit ratings are important to our ability to issue debt at favorable rates of interest, among other terms. Refer to our risk factor Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our financing activity\u201d for further details regarding the potential impacts from changes to our credit ratings.\nMaintenance Capital Expenditures and Repair and Maintenance Expenses\nWe utilize a strategic approach to recurring maintenance capital expenditures and repair and maintenance expenses to maintain the high quality and operational efficiency of our warehouses and ensure that our warehouses meet the mission-critical\u201d role they serve in the cold chain.\nMaintenance Capital Expenditures\nMaintenance capital expenditures are capitalized investments made to extend the life of, and provide future economic benefit from, our existing temperature-controlled warehouse network and its existing supporting personal property and information technology systems. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures related to our existing temperature-controlled warehouse network include replacing roofs and refrigeration equipment, and upgrading our racking systems. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures related to personal property include expenditures on material handling equipment (e.g., fork lifts and pallet jacks) and related batteries. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures related to information technology include expenditures on existing servers, networking equipment and current software. Maintenance capital expenditures do not include acquisition costs contemplated when underwriting the purchase of a building or costs which are incurred to bring a building up to Americold's operating standards. The following table sets forth our recurring maintenance capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except per cubic foot amounts) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,967 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,966 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal property </td> <td>4,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Information technology </td> <td>4,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,977 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital expenditures </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital expenditures per cubic foot </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRepair and Maintenance Expenses\nWe incur repair and maintenance expenses that include costs of normal maintenance and repairs and minor replacements that do not materially extend the life of the property or provide future economic benefits. Repair and maintenance expenses consist of expenses related to our existing temperature-controlled warehouse network and its existing supporting personal property and are reflected as operating expenses on our income statement. Examples of repair and maintenance expenses related to our warehouse portfolio include ordinary repair and maintenance on roofs, racking, walls, doors, parking lots and refrigeration equipment. Examples of repair and maintenance expenses related to personal property include ordinary repair and maintenance expenses on material handling equipment (e.g., fork lifts and pallet jacks) and related batteries. The following table sets forth our repair and maintenance expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except per cubic foot amounts) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal property </td> <td>30,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repair and maintenance expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repair and maintenance expenses per cubic foot </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nExternal Growth, Expansion and Development Capital Expenditures\nExternal growth expenditures represent asset acquisitions or business combinations. Expansion and development capital expenditures are investments made to support both our customers and our warehouse expansion and development initiatives. It also includes investments in enhancing our information technology platform. Examples of capital expenditures associated with expansion and development initiatives include funding of construction costs, increases to warehouse capacity and pallet positions, acquisitions of reusable incremental material handling equipment, and implementing energy efficiency projects, such as thermal energy storage, LED lighting, motion-sensor technology, variable frequency drives for our fans and compressors, rapid-close doors and alternative-power generation technologies. Examples of capital expenditures to enhance our information technology platform include the delivery of new systems and software and customer interface functionality.\nAcquisitions\nThe acquisitions completed during the first quarter of 2020 relate to Newport and Nova Cold. The acquisitions completed during the third quarter of 2020 relate to AM-C Warehouses and Caspers. The acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter of 2020 related to Hall's and Agro. The acquisitions completed during 2019 relate to Cloverleaf, Lanier, PortFresh, and MHW, and excludes amounts related to the assets under construction for expansion and development projects, further detailed below.\nThe PortFresh acquisition cost included approximately $15.9 million allocated to land on which we have developed a new facility, and have classified within Expansion and development expenditures in order to reflect the total cost of the project. The Cloverleaf acquisition included approximately $17.0 million allocated to assets under construction which we have classified within Expansion and development expenditures in order to reflect the total cost of the projects discussed further below. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the purchase price allocation for each acquisition.\nExpansion and development\nThe expansion and development expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 are primarily driven by $74.8 million related to Plainville, Connecticut and $73.3 million related to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which are our two fully-automated development sites for Ahold Delhaize, $62.2 million related to the ongoing Atlanta major markets strategy project, $12.5 million in construction costs related to our Savannah expansion site, which was completed during the second quarter of 2020 and $22.0 million related to the Auckland, New Zealand expansion project which was started during the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2020, we invested $11.7 million in our Russellville expansion.\nSubsequent to the acquisition of MHW, during the first quarter of 2020, we exercised our call option to purchase land from the holder of the ground lease for $4.1 million. We also invested an additional $4.7 million for the Rochelle facility, which was previously opened during the second quarter of 2019.\nAs a result of the Cloverleaf Acquisition on May 1, 2019, we acquired expansion projects which were substantially completed during 2019. We incurred an additional $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 for these expansion projects.\nExpansion and development initiatives also include $20.0 million of corporate initiatives, which are projects designed to reduce future spending over the course of time. This category reflects return on investment projects, conversion of leases to owned assets, and other cost-saving initiatives.\nFinally, we incurred approximately $10.6 million for contemplated future expansion or development projects.\nThe following table sets forth our acquisitions, expansion and development capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands).\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions, net of cash acquired and adjustments(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,858,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,377,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expansion and development initiatives </td> <td>298,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>210,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Information technology </td> <td>7,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,857 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Growth and expansion capital expenditures </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,165,535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,593,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired and adjustments does not include $512 million of equity issued directly to Oaktree Capital, the former owners of Agro, as consideration for the Agro acquisition.\nFuture Sources and Uses of Cash\nOn January 29, 2021, the Company expanded its 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility by $200 million. In addition, the Company paid $200 million of principal on Tranche A-1 of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan. The maturity, margin, and other terms of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility remain unchanged.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>293,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236,189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,249,125) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,604,934) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,329,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,395,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our net cash provided by operating activities was $293.7 million, an increase of $57.5 million, or 24.3%, compared to $236.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is due to higher segment contribution in our same store results and as a result of our acquisitions during 2019 and 2020.\nInvesting Activities\nOur net cash used in investing activities was $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash used for the acquisitions of Agro, AM-C, Hall's, Newport and Nova Cold and accounted for as business combinations totaled $1.9 billion. Cash used in the acquisition of real estate was $25.5 million, which related to the asset acquisition of Caspers during the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, the net payment in settlement of a foreign currency forward contract in connection with the issuance of the Series D and Series E senior unsecured notes was $45.0 million. Additions to property, buildings and equipment were $376.8 million and $217.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in additions to property, buildings and equipment were driven by the Ahold, Atlanta, New Zealand, Savannah, Calgary, and Russellville expansion and development projects. Additionally, we invested $26.2 million in the Brazil JV during the first quarter of 2020. These outflows were offset by $80.2 million in proceeds from the sale of land and property, buildings, and equipment related to the sale of land in Sydney, the Quarry segment and the sale of the Boston facility.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 and primarily consisted of $1.3 billion paid for the acquisitions of Cloverleaf and Lanier, $85.2 million paid for the acquisitions of real estate, which related to the asset acquisitions of Portfresh and MHW, and $217.2 million used in additions to property, buildings and equipment. These cash outflows were partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of our investment in the China JV for $14.3 million and $2.0 million return of investment in a joint venture during 2019.\nFinancing Activities\nOur net cash provided by financing activities was $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash provided by financing activities for the current period primarily consisted of $1.6 billion net proceeds from equity offerings during 2020, the $922.4 million received in connection with the issuance of the Series D and Series E senior unsecured notes which was partially offset by the related debt issuance costs of $10.1 million, the $177.1 million received in connection with the refinancing of our Senior Unsecured Term Loan and $636.8 million in proceeds from our revolving line of credit. These cash inflows were partially offset by $627.1 million of repayment on our revolving line of credit using the proceeds from the issuance of the Series D and Series E senior unsecured notes, $167.1 million of distributions paid, $156.8 million of repayments on term loan and mortgage notes and $23.7 million of payments related to lease obligations.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.40 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 and primarily consisted of $1.21 billion net proceeds from the April 2019 follow-on offering, $350.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of our Series C senior unsecured notes in May 2019, $100.0 million in proceeds received from revolving line of credit and $10.2 million in proceeds from stock options exercised. These cash inflows were partially offset by $135.4 million of distributions paid, $100.0 million of repayment to revolving line of credit, $16.5 million of repayments on lease obligations, $10.4 million of repayment of mortgage notes and notes payable, $7.1 million paid for tax withholdings remitted to authorities related to stock options exercised and $2.1 million paid related to debt issuance costs.\nWithdrawal Liability from Multi-employer Plans\nAs of December 31, 2020, we participated in seven multiemployer pension plans administered by labor unions representing approximately 13% of our associates. We make periodic contributions to these plans pursuant to the terms of our collective bargaining agreements to allow the plans to meet their pension benefit obligations.\nIn the event that we withdraw from participation in any of the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate, the documents governing the applicable plan and applicable law could require us to make an additional contribution to the applicable plan in the amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to our participation in the plan, and we would have to reflect that as an expense on our Consolidated Statement of Operations and as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer pension plan would depend on the extent of the plan's funding of vested benefits as of the year in which the withdrawal occurs, and may vary depending on the funded status of the applicable multiemployer pension plan, whether there is a mass withdrawal of all participating employers and whether any other participating employer in the applicable plan withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan. The present value of all benefits vested under each of the multiemployer plans that we participated in as of December 31, 2020 (based on the labor union's assumptions used to fund such plan) did not, as of the last annual valuation date applicable thereto, exceed the value of the assets of such plan allocable to such vested benefits. Based on the latest information available from plan administrators, we estimate our share of the aggregate withdrawal liability for the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate could have been as much as $726.9 million as of December 31, 2020, of which we estimate that certain of our customers are contractually obligated to make indemnification payments to us for approximately $699.7 million. However, there is no guarantee that, to the extent we incurred any such withdrawal liability, we would be successful in obtaining any indemnification payments therefore.\nIn the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans, we could agree to discontinue participation in one or more plans, and in that event we could face a withdrawal liability. Additionally, we could be treated as withdrawing from a plan if the number of our associates participating in the plan is reduced to a certain degree over certain periods of time.\nInflation\nOur business could be impacted due to inflation. We believe, however, that we are well positioned to be able to manage our business in an inflationary environment. Certain of our expenses are subject to normal inflationary pressures and this could lead to increases in the operating costs of our properties, such as wages and benefits, insurance, real estate taxes, utility expenses, equipment repair and replacement and other operating expenses. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases with increased operating efficiencies and the ability to increase prices in our customer contracts (many of which contain provisions for inflationary price escalators), we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies or increased storage or service charges.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods described is based on our audited consolidated financial statements and our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, each of which has been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these historical financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For more information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following critical accounting discussion pertains to accounting policies management believes are most critical to the portrayal of our historical financial condition and results of operations and that require significant, difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to those of other companies.\nGoodwill Impairment Evaluation\nWe perform impairment testing of goodwill as of October 1 of each year, and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators and competition. As of October 1, 2020, our reporting units included the following: North American warehouse, U.S. transportation, North America third-party managed, international warehouse, international third-party managed, and international transportation. Our reporting units may change with the integration of Agro's operations in Europe, North America, South America, and Australia. However, since the Agro acquisition closed on December 30, 2020, it was not included in the 2020 annual goodwill impairment evaluation.\nWe may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise, we perform a quantitative impairment test. We may also perform a quantitative evaluation periodically, even if there is no change of events or circumstances.\nTo perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. The estimation of the net present value of future cash flows is based upon varying economic assumptions, including significant assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating costs and margins, capital expenditures, tax rates, long-term growth rates and discount\nrates. These assumptions are based on risk-adjusted growth rates and discount factors accommodating conservative viewpoints that consider the full range of variability contemplated in the current and potential future economic situations. The discount rates utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on the respective reporting units weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels. We also assess market-based multiples of other market-participant companies, further corroborating that our discounted cash flow models reflect fair value assumptions that are appropriately aligned with market-participant valuation multiples.\nHistorically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the value of goodwill. The results of our 2020 impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of the corresponding carrying amount as of October 1, and no impairment of goodwill existed.\nWe have completed various acquisitions over the past year, which have increased our consolidated goodwill balance. On January 2, 2020, the Company completed the acquisitions of Nova Cold and Newport. The resulting intangible assets included goodwill of $71.7 million for the warehouse segment. On August 31, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of AM-C. The resulting intangible assets included goodwill of $10.4 million for the warehouse segment. The goodwill from Nova Cold, Newport, and AM-C was included in the annual goodwill impairment test as these acquisitions closed prior to October 1, 2020.\nOn November 2, 2020 the Company completed the acquisition of Hall's. The resulting intangible assets associated with the Hall's acquisition included goodwill of $42.7 million that has been allocated to the warehouse and transportation segments. On December 30, 2020 the Company completed the acquisition of Agro Merchants. The resulting intangible assets associated with the acquisition included goodwill of $346.7 million that has been allocated to the warehouse and transportation segments. The goodwill from Hall's and Agro was excluded from the annual goodwill impairment test, as the test was completed as of October 1, 2020. However, we have not identified any indicators of impairment subsequent to the closing of the aforementioned acquisitions that would necessitate the need for us to perform a quantitative impairment test subsequent to the annual quantitative test performed as of October 1, 2020.\nBusiness Combinations\nFrom time to time, we may enter into business combinations. In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations\u201d, we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is assigned to each reporting unit based upon the expected proportionate gross margin. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, land and buildings and improvements. Significant estimates and assumptions include subjective and/or complex judgments regarding items such as revenue growth rates, operating costs and margins, capital expenditures, tax rates, long-term growth rates, discount rates, customer attrition rates, economic lives and other factors, including estimating future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. The significant assumptions impacting the fair value of the acquired real property include estimates of indirect costs and entrepreneurial profit on the transaction, which were added to the replacement cost of the acquired assets in order to estimate their fair value in the market.\nThe acquisition method of accounting also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record future impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense.\nOn November 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Halls for total consideration of $489.2 million. On December 30, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Agro Merchants for total consideration of $1.59 billion. The acquisition accounting for both of these business combinations is based upon a preliminary valuation. Our estimates and assumptions are subject to change during the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the acquisition date. The primary areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the following: finalizing the review and valuation of land, land improvements, building and machinery and equipment (including the models, key assumptions, estimates and inputs) and assignment of remaining useful lives associated with the depreciable assets), (ii) finalizing the review and valuation of customer related intangible assets (including key assumptions, inputs and estimates), (iii) finalizing our review of certain current and non-current assets acquired and liabilities assumed, (iv) finalizing the valuation of certain in-place contracts or contractual relationships (including but not limited to leases), including determining the appropriate amortization period, (v) finalizing the evaluation and valuation of certain legal matters and/or other loss contingencies, including those that we may not yet be aware of but meet the requirement to qualify as a pre-acquisition contingency, and (vi) finalizing our estimate of the impact of purchase accounting on deferred income tax liabilities.\nTo the extent possible, estimates have been considered and recorded, as appropriate, for the items above based on the information available as of December 31, 2020. We will continue to evaluate these items until they are satisfactorily resolved and adjust our acquisition accounting accordingly, within the allowable measurement period (not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition), as defined by ASC 805.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur primary revenue source consists of rent, storage and warehouse services revenues. Additionally, we charge transportation fees to those customers who use our transportation services, where we act as the principal in the arrangement of the services. We also receive a reimbursement of substantially all expenses for warehouses that we manage on behalf of third-party owners, with all reimbursements recognized as revenues under the relevant accounting guidance. We also earn management fees, incentive fees upon achieving negotiated performance and cost-savings results, or an applicable mark-up on costs. Revenues from storage and handling are recognized over the period consistent with the transfer of the service to the customer. Multiple contracts with a single counterparty are accounted for as separate arrangements. We recognize transportation fees and expenses on a gross basis upon delivery of products on behalf of our customers. We also recognize management fees and related expense reimbursements as revenues as we perform management services and incur the expense.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "We are required to distribute 90% of our taxable income (excluding capital gains) on an annual basis in order to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to shareholders from cash flows from our operating activities. While historically we have satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to our shareholders, we may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property. All such distributions are at the discretion of our Board of Trustees. We consider market factors and our performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining distribution levels. We have distributed at least 100% of our taxable income annually since inception to minimize corporate-level federal income taxes. Amounts accumulated for distribution to shareholders are invested primarily in interest-bearing accounts and short-term interest-bearing securities, which are consistent with our intention to maintain our status as a REIT.\n(b)Maintenance capital expenditures include capital expenditures made to extend the life of, and provide future economic benefit from, our existing temperature-controlled warehouse network and its existing supporting personal property and information technology.\n(a)Stub period dividend paid to shareholders of record prior to the IPO.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td>

of credit issued on the Company's 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nThe Series A, B, C, D, and E senior notes (collectively referred to as the Senior Unsecured Notes\u201d) and guarantee agreement includes a prepayment option executable at any time during the term of the loans. The prepayment can be either a partial payment or payment in full, as long as the partial payment is at least 5% of the outstanding principal. Any prepayment in full must include a make-whole amount, which is the discounted remaining scheduled payments due to the lender. The discount rate to be used is equal to 0.50% plus the yield to maturity reported for the most recently actively traded U.S. Treasury Securities with a maturity equal to the remaining average life of the prepaid principal. The Company must give each lender at least 10 days written notice whenever it intends to prepay any portion of the debt.\n We calculate funds from operations, or FFO, in accordance with the standards established by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding extraordinary items as defined under U.S. GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, real estate asset impairment and our share of reconciling items for partially owned entities. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it excludes the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs, which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. We calculate core funds from operations, or Core FFO, as FFO adjusted for the effects of gain or loss on the sale of non-real estate assets, non-real estate impairment, acquisition, litigation and other, share-based compensation expense for the IPO retention grants, bridge loan commitment fees, loss on debt extinguishment, modifications and termination of derivative instruments, foreign currency exchange loss and gain from sale of partially owned entities. We also adjust for the impact of Core FFO attributable to partially owned entities. We have elected to reflect our share of Core FFO attributable to partially owned entities since the Brazil JV is a strategic partnership which we continue to actively participate in on an ongoing basis. The previous joint venture, the China JV, was considered for disposition during the periods presented. We believe that Core FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it excludes the effects of certain items which can create significant earnings volatility, but which do not directly relate to our core business operations. We believe Core FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods, while also providing a more meaningful predictor of future earnings potential. However, because FFO and Core FFO add back real estate depreciation and amortization and do not capture the level of maintenance capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, both of which have material economic impacts on our results from operations, we believe the utility of FFO and Core FFO as a measure of our performance may be limited. We calculate adjusted funds from operations, or Adjusted FFO, as Core FFO adjusted for the effects of amortization of deferred financing costs, pension withdrawal liability and above or below market leases, straight-line net rent, provision or benefit from deferred income taxes, share-based compensation expense from grants of stock options and restricted stock units under our equity incentive plans, excluding IPO grants, non-real estate depreciation and amortization, and maintenance capital expenditures. We also adjust for AFFO attributable to our share of reconciling items of partially owned entities. We believe that Adjusted FFO is helpful to investors as a meaningful supplemental comparative performance measure of our ability to make incremental capital investments in our business and to assess our ability to fund distribution requirements from our operating activities. FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO should be evaluated along with U.S. GAAP net income and net income per diluted share (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures) in evaluating our operating performance. FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO do not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are not indicative of our results of operations or cash flows from operating activities as disclosed in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO should be considered as supplements, but not alternatives, to our net income or cash flows from operating activities as indicators of our operating performance. Moreover, other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or may interpret the NAREIT definition differently than we do. Accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to FFO as calculated by other REITs. In addition, there is no industry definition of Core FFO or Adjusted FFO and, as a result, other REITs may also calculate Core FFO or Adjusted FFO, or other similarly-captioned metrics, in a manner different than we do. The table below reconciles FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \nIn the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans, we could agree to discontinue participation in one or more plans, and in that event we could face a withdrawal liability. Additionally, we could be treated as withdrawing from a plan if the number of our associates participating in the plan is reduced to a certain degree over certain periods of time.\nTable 54:

During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company entered into an undesignated foreign currency forward contract to lock in the conversion of the expected proceeds of the \u20ac750 million denominated debt issuance to USD, which settled on December 30, 2020, and resulted in $45.0 million in foreign currency exchange loss when compared to the USD equivalent of the Euro denominated debt at market rates, on the date of issuance.\nWe utilize a strategic approach to recurring maintenance capital expenditures and repair and maintenance expenses to maintain the high quality and operational efficiency of our warehouses and ensure that our warehouses meet the mission-critical\u201d role they serve in the cold chain.\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands, except per cubic foot amounts) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal property </td> <td>30,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repair and maintenance expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repair and maintenance expenses per cubic foot </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(4)Calculated as rent and storage contribution (NOI) divided by rent and storage revenue.\nThird-party managed revenue was $291.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $38.8 million, or 15.3%, compared to $252.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, third-party managed revenue was $292.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $39.1 million, or 15.5%, compared to the prior year. This increase was a result of higher business volume in our domestic and Australia managed operations due to the consumer demand shift to retail. This increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation related to our Canadian and Australian managed revenues, and the impacts from the exit of two Canadian managed facilities during 2020 and the exit of one domestic managed facility during the third quarter of 2019.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n(2)Calculated as rent and storage revenues less power and other facilities costs.\nThe following table presents revenues, cost of operations, contribution (NOI) and margins for our same stores and non-same stores with a reconciliation to the total financial metrics of our warehouse segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nComparison of Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nBusiness Combinations\nWarehouse segment cost of operations was $1.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $99.4 million, or 10.7%, compared to $929.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, our warehouse segment cost of operations was $1.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $103.4 million, or 11.1%, compared to the prior year. Approximately $97.8 million of the increase, on an actual basis,was primarily driven by the additional facilities we acquired in connection with the aforementioned acquisitions. In addition, we incurred increases in our cost of operations in response to COVID-19. We undertook initiatives to ensure the health and safety of our associates, incurring higher costs for items such as labor, due to social distancing requirements, cleaning and sanitation supplies, and other personal protective equipment ( PPE\u201d). These incremental COVID-19 expenses include higher sanitation costs of $3.2 million and higher PPE costs of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, we experienced higher property taxes and property insurance expense during 2020, due primarily to our growing portfolio. During the second quarter of 2020, we also paid a front-line appreciation bonus to our associates in recognition of their dedication and efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic, which totaled $4.3 million. The foreign currency translation of expenses incurred by our foreign operations had a $4.0 million favorable impact during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.\n\u2022these measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n(c)Declared in June and included in the $38.8 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\n(1)We define average economic occupancy as the aggregate number of physically occupied pallets and any additional pallets otherwise contractually committed for a given period, without duplication. We estimate the number of contractually committed pallet positions by taking into account actual pallet commitment specified in each customers' contract, and subtracting the physical pallet positions.\nEconomic occupancy at our same stores was 80.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 110 basis points compared to 79.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This change was primarily the result of an increase in fixed storage contracts. Our economic occupancy at our same stores for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 781 basis points higher than our corresponding average physical occupancy of 72.7%. The decrease of 265 basis points in average physical occupancy compared to 75.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 was partially driven by lower protein occupancy and lower food service business occupancy due to stay-at-home\u201d orders as well as port congestion as a result of COVID-19, which generated lower throughput of inventory within our warehouses. This was partially offset by the increase in physical occupancy related to the retail products as a result of higher grocery demand related to COVID-19.\n\n\u2022a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of greater than or equal to 1.50x; and\nFuture Sources and Uses of Cash\n(1)The adjustments from our U.S. GAAP operating results to calculate our operating results on a constant currency basis are the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the comparable prior period.\nIn addition to our segment contribution (NOI) and segment contribution (NOI) margin, we analyze the contribution (NOI) of our warehouse rent and storage operations and our warehouse services operations within our warehouse segment. We calculate the contribution (NOI) of our warehouse rent and storage operations as rent and storage revenues less power and other facilities cost. We calculate the contribution (NOI) of our warehouse services operations as warehouse services revenues less labor and other service costs. We calculate the contribution (NOI) margin for each of these operations as the applicable contribution (NOI) measure divided by the applicable revenue measure. We believe the presentation of these contribution (NOI) and contribution (NOI) margin measures helps investors understand the relative revenues, costs and earnings resulting from each of these separate types of services we provide to our customers in the same manner reviewed by our management in connection with the operation of our business. These contribution (NOI) measures within our warehouse segment are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and these measures should be considered as supplements, but not as alternatives, to our results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We provide reconciliations of these measures in the discussions of our comparative results of operations below.\n(9)The effective interest rate includes effects of amortization of the deferred financing costs. The weighted average effective interest rate for total debt was 3.19% and 4.57% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe are the world's largest publicly traded REIT focused on the ownership, operation, acquisition and development of temperature-controlled warehouses. We are organized as a self-administered and self-managed REIT with proven operating, development and acquisition expertise. As of December 31, 2020, we operated a global network of 238 temperature-controlled warehouses encompassing over 1.4 billion cubic feet, with 194 warehouses in North America, 26 in Europe, 15 warehouses in Asia-Pacific, and 3 warehouses in South America. We view and manage our business through three primary business segments: warehouse, third-party managed and transportation. In addition, we hold two minority interests in Brazilian-based joint ventures, one with SuperFrio, which owns or operates 22 temperature-controlled warehouses and one with Comfrio, which owns or operates 13 temperature-controlled warehouses.\nrates. These assumptions are based on risk-adjusted growth rates and discount factors accommodating conservative viewpoints that consider the full range of variability contemplated in the current and potential future economic situations. The discount rates utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on the respective reporting units weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels. We also assess market-based multiples of other market-participant companies, further corroborating that our discounted cash flow models reflect fair value assumptions that are appropriately aligned with market-participant valuation multiples.\nThe following table presents the operating results of our third-party managed segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\u2022our outstanding equity forward sale agreements;\n\u2022Litigation costs incurred in order to defend ourselves from litigation charges outside of the normal course of business and related settlement costs.\nStrategic Shift within Our Transportation Segment\nWe use the following non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental performance measures of our business: FFO, Core FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDAre and Core EBITDA.\nMaterial Acquisition in our 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is defined as one in which assets acquired exceeds an amount equal to 5% of total asset value as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter publicly available. Obligations under our 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility are general unsecured obligations of our Operating Partnership and are guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe PortFresh acquisition cost included approximately $15.9 million allocated to land on which we have developed a new facility, and have classified within Expansion and development expenditures in order to reflect the total cost of the project. The Cloverleaf acquisition included approximately $17.0 million allocated to assets under construction which we have classified within Expansion and development expenditures in order to reflect the total cost of the projects discussed further below. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the purchase price allocation for each acquisition.\n\u2022a maximum unsecured indebtedness to qualified assets ratio of less than 0.60 to 1.00;\n\u2022capital expenditures;\nWe calculate same store contribution (NOI)\u201d as revenues for the same store population less its cost of operations (excluding any depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses, corporate-level acquisition, litigation and other expenses and gain or loss on sale of real estate). In order to derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we also calculate our same store contribution (NOI) on a constant currency basis to remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the comparable prior period exchange rate to translate from local currency into U.S. dollars for both periods. We evaluate the performance of the warehouses we own or lease using a same store\u201d analysis, and we believe that same store contribution (NOI) is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it includes the operating performance from the population of properties that is consistent from period to period and also on a constant currency basis, thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of our warehouse portfolio and currency fluctuations on performance measures.\nFacility due to the decrease in the LIBOR rate. This was offset by the increase in the Senior Unsecured Term Loan A which was expanded to fund the Nova Cold acquisition and the private placement of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of Series C Senior Unsecured Notes on May 7, 2019, which were used to fund a portion of the Cloverleaf and Lanier acquisitions. While our average outstanding principal has increased from the comparable prior period, on average, the effective interest rate of our outstanding debt has decreased from 4.79% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 3.94% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs part of our initiatives to streamline our business processes and to reduce our cost structure, we have evaluated and exited less strategic and profitable markets or business lines, including the sale of certain warehouse assets, the exit of certain leased facilities, the exit of certain managed warehouse agreements, the sale of our quarry business and the exit of the China JV (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this\nOn November 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Halls for total consideration of $489.2 million. On December 30, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Agro Merchants for total consideration of $1.59 billion. The acquisition accounting for both of these business combinations is based upon a preliminary valuation. Our estimates and assumptions are subject to change during the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the acquisition date. The primary areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the following: finalizing the review and valuation of land, land improvements, building and machinery and equipment (including the models, key assumptions, estimates and inputs) and assignment of remaining useful lives associated with the depreciable assets), (ii) finalizing the review and valuation of customer related intangible assets (including key assumptions, inputs and estimates), (iii) finalizing our review of certain current and non-current assets acquired and liabilities assumed, (iv) finalizing the valuation of certain in-place contracts or contractual relationships (including but not limited to leases), including determining the appropriate amortization period, (v) finalizing the evaluation and valuation of certain legal matters and/or other loss contingencies, including those that we may not yet be aware of but meet the requirement to qualify as a pre-acquisition contingency, and (vi) finalizing our estimate of the impact of purchase accounting on deferred income tax liabilities.\nInvesting Activities\nAs a result of this distribution requirement, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies which are not REITs can. We may need to continue to raise capital in the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, as well as potential developments in new or existing properties, acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures. In addition, we may be required to use borrowings under our revolving credit facility, if necessary, to meet REIT distribution requirements and maintain our REIT status.\n(a)(Gain) loss on sale of real estate, net of withholding tax include withholding tax on the sale of Sydney land which is included in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we participated in seven multiemployer pension plans administered by labor unions representing approximately 13% of our associates. We make periodic contributions to these plans pursuant to the terms of our collective bargaining agreements to allow the plans to meet their pension benefit obligations.\nConstant Currency Metrics\n\n2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility\nOn May 1, 2013, we entered into a mortgage financing in an aggregate principal amount of $322.0 million, which we refer to as the 2013 Mortgage Loans. The debt consists of a senior debt note and two mezzanine notes. The components are cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted. The senior debt note requires monthly principal payments. The mezzanine notes require no principal payments until the stated maturity date in May 2023. The interest rates on the notes are fixed and range from 3.81% to 11.50% per annum. The senior debt note and the two mezzanine notes remain subject to yield maintenance provisions. We used the net proceeds of these loans to refinance certain of the 2006 Mortgage Loans, acquire two warehouses, and fund general corporate purposes.\n\u2022Non-recurring public company implementation costs associated with the implementation of financial reporting systems and processes needed to convert the organization to a public reporting company.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.40 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 and primarily consisted of $1.21 billion net proceeds from the April 2019 follow-on offering, $350.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of our Series C senior unsecured notes in May 2019, $100.0 million in proceeds received from revolving line of credit and $10.2 million in proceeds from stock options exercised. These cash inflows were partially offset by $135.4 million of distributions paid, $100.0 million of repayment to revolving line of credit, $16.5 million of repayments on lease obligations, $10.4 million of repayment of mortgage notes and notes payable, $7.1 million paid for tax withholdings remitted to authorities related to stock options exercised and $2.1 million paid related to debt issuance costs.\nOn April 26, 2019, we completed a debt private placement transaction consisting of $350.0 million senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 4.10% due January 8, 2030 ( Series C\u201d). The transaction closed on May 7, 2019. Interest is paid on January 8 and July 8 of each year until maturity, with the first payment occurring January\n(d)Declared in September and included in the $43.3 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\n2018 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility\n(1)Represents the relevant average foreign exchange rates in effect in the comparable prior period applied to the activity for the current period. The average foreign currency exchange rates we apply to our operating results are derived from third party reporting sources for the periods indicated.\n\u2022cash flows from operations;\nMaintenance Capital Expenditures\nIf a change in control occurs for us, we must issue an offer to prepay the remaining portion of the debt to the lenders. The prepayment amount will be 100% of the principal amount, as well as accrued and unpaid interest.\nIn connection with the early repayment of a portion of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility during the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recorded $1.5 million to Loss on debt extinguishment and modifications\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, representing the write-off of the proportionate unamortized deferred financing costs from the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. In addition, the Company terminated the two interest rate swaps related to the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility for a fee of $16.4 million. Approximately $8.7 million of this fee will remain in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\u201d and will be amortized to expense through 2024, while $7.7 million was expensed to Loss on debt extinguishment, modifications, and termination of derivative instruments\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nResults of Operations\n (1) Net debt to Core EBITDA represents (i) our gross debt (defined as total debt plus discount and deferred financing costs) less cash and cash equivalents divided by (ii) Core EBITDA. Core EBITDA for 2020 and 2019 for purposes of this calculation assumes ownership of our acquisitions for the full twelve months of the year. Our management believes that this ratio is useful because it provides investors with information regarding gross debt less cash and cash equivalents, which could be used to repay debt, compared to our performance as measured using Core EBITDA. The following table reconciles net debt to total debt, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP: \nThe following table shows the number of same-store warehouses in our portfolio and the number of warehouses excluded as same-store warehouses for the year ended December 31, 2020. While not included in the non-same store warehouse count in the table below, the results of operations for the non-same store warehouses includes the partial period impact of the sites that were exited during the year ended December 31, 2020, as described in footnote 2 following the table. In addition, we hold two minority interests in Brazilian-based joint ventures, one with SuperFrio, which owns or operates 22 temperature-controlled warehouses and one with Comfrio, which owns or operates 13 temperature-controlled warehouses; these joint ventures are not included in the table below.\nSame store contribution (NOI) is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies providing temperature-controlled warehouse storage and handling and other warehouse services may not define same store or calculate same store contribution (NOI) in a manner consistent with our definition or calculation. Same store contribution (NOI) should be considered as a supplement, but not as an alternative, to our results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We provide reconciliations of these measures in the discussions of our comparative results of operations below.\nAs discussed above under Key Factors Affecting Our Business and Financial Results-Foreign Currency Translation Impact on Our Operations,\u201d our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations outside our control that are caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues generated and expenses incurred by our operations outside the United States. As a result, in order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we analyze our business performance based on certain constant currency reporting that represents current period results translated into U.S. dollars at the relevant average foreign exchange rates applicable in the comparable prior period. We believe that the presentation of constant currency results provides a measurement of our ongoing operations that is meaningful to investors because it excludes the impact of these foreign currency movements that we cannot control. Constant currency results are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and our constant currency results should be considered as a supplement, but not as an alternative, to our results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The constant currency performance measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We provide reconciliations of these measures in the discussions of our comparative results of operations below. Our discussion of the drivers of our performance below are based upon U.S. GAAP.\nOther Expense\nThe 2013 Mortgage Loans also require compliance with other financial covenants, including a debt coverage ratio and cash flow calculation, as defined.\n(2)We define average physical occupancy as the average number of occupied pallets divided by the estimated number of average physical pallet positions in our warehouses for the applicable period. We estimate the number of physical pallet positions by taking into account actual racked space and by estimating unracked space on an as-if racked basis. We base this estimate on a formula utilizing the total cubic feet of each room within the warehouse that is unracked divided by the volume of an assumed rack space that is\nOur transportation segment continued its strategic shift to focus on more profitable solutions, which create value for our customers while driving and supporting our warehouse business including consolidation offerings. Transportation revenue was $142.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 1.8%, compared to $144.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, transportation revenue was $143.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1.1\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the China JV). Through our process of active portfolio management, we continue to evaluate our markets and offerings.\n\n(2)Includes real estate rent expense of $12.9 million and $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSelling, general and administrative. Corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses were $144.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $15.4 million, or 11.9%, compared to $129.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Included in these amounts are business development expenses attributable to new business pursuits, supply chain solutions and underwriting, facility development, customer onboarding, and engineering and consulting services to support our customers in the cold chain. Business development expenses represented approximately 13% and 14% of corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe these costs are comparable to leasing costs for other publicly-traded REITs. The increase in corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher share-based compensation and higher payroll and benefits related to additional investments to support our expanded development pipeline and higher professional fees. This was offset by a reduction in travel expense due to stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, paired with net synergies realized from acquisitions. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.3% and 7.2%, respectively, of total revenues.\nservices to its customers. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of the facilities within our warehouse segment, and the results of Halls transportation services within our transportation segment.\nTransportation Segment\nThe following table presents the operating results of our transportation segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nOn December 30, 2020 we completed a debt private placement transaction consisting of (i) \u20ac400.00 million senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 1.62% due January 7, 2031 ( Series D\u201d) and (ii) \u20ac350.00 million senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 1.65% due January 7, 2033 ( Series E\u201d). Interest is payable on January 7 and July 7 of each year until maturity, with the first payment occurring July 7, 2021. The notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Operating Partnership and are guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company. In connection with entering into the agreement, we incurred approximately $4.5 million of debt issuance costs related to the issuance, which we amortize as interest expense under the effective interest method. The proceeds of the Series D and Series E issuance were used to fund a portion of the Agro acquisition, provide long-term financing for the Halls acquisition and repay a portion of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan Tranche A-1.\n(6)The 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan Tranche A-2 is denominated in Canadian dollars and aggregates to CAD $250.0 million. The carrying value in the table above is the US dollar equivalent as of December 31, 2020.\nWe are a well-known seasoned issuer with an effective shelf registration statement filed on April 16, 2020, which registered an indeterminate amount of common shares, preferred shares, depositary shares and warrants, as well as debt securities of the Operating Partnership, which will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us. As circumstances warrant, we may issue equity securities from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. We may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, the funding of development, expansion and acquisition opportunities and to increase working capital.\n(1)The adjustments from our U.S. GAAP operating results to calculate our operating results on a constant currency basis is the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the comparable prior period.\n We use EBITDAre and Core EBITDA as measures of our operating performance and not as measures of liquidity. The table below reconciles EBITDAre and Core EBITDA to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \n(8)The Senior Unsecured Notes Series E is denominated in Euros and aggregates to Euro $350.0 million. The carrying value in the table above is the US dollar equivalent as of December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Terminated site operations costs represent expenses incurred to return leased sites to their original physical state at lease inception in connection with the termination of the applicable underlying lease. These terminations were part of our strategic efforts to exit or sell non-strategic warehouses as opposed to ordinary course lease expirations. Repair and maintenance expenses associated with our ordinary course operations are reflected as operating expenses on our consolidated statement of operations.\nOn August 31, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Caspers Cold Storage for cash consideration of approximately $25.6 million, utilizing available cash on hand. Caspers consisted of a single temperature-controlled warehouse located in Tampa, Florida. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of this facility within our warehouse segment.\nPresentation\nIn the event that we withdraw from participation in any of the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate, the documents governing the applicable plan and applicable law could require us to make an additional contribution to the applicable plan in the amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to our participation in the plan, and we would have to reflect that as an expense on our Consolidated Statement of Operations and as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer pension plan would depend on the extent of the plan's funding of vested benefits as of the year in which the withdrawal occurs, and may vary depending on the funded status of the applicable multiemployer pension plan, whether there is a mass withdrawal of all participating employers and whether any other participating employer in the applicable plan withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan. The present value of all benefits vested under each of the multiemployer plans that we participated in as of December 31, 2020 (based on the labor union's assumptions used to fund such plan) did not, as of the last annual valuation date applicable thereto, exceed the value of the assets of such plan allocable to such vested benefits. Based on the latest information available from plan administrators, we estimate our share of the aggregate withdrawal liability for the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate could have been as much as $726.9 million as of December 31, 2020, of which we estimate that certain of our customers are contractually obligated to make indemnification payments to us for approximately $699.7 million. However, there is no guarantee that, to the extent we incurred any such withdrawal liability, we would be successful in obtaining any indemnification payments therefore.\ncommon shares on behalf of our previously significant shareholders in March 2019, for which we received no proceeds.\nRepair and Maintenance Expenses\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding our expectation for future performance, liquidity and capital resources, that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include those identified below and those described under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed on March 2, 2020, for a discussion of the comparative results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nWe define average economic occupancy as the aggregate number of physically occupied pallets and any additional pallets otherwise contractually committed for a given period, without duplication. We estimate the number of contractually committed pallet positions by taking into account the actual pallet commitment specified in each customers' contract, and subtracting the physical pallet positions. We regard economic occupancy as an important driver of our financial results. Historically, providers of temperature-controlled warehouse space have offered storage services to customers on an as-utilized, on-demand basis. We actively seek to enter into contracts that implement our commercial business rules which contemplate, among other things, fixed storage commitments in connection with establishing new customer relationships. Additionally, we actively seek opportunities to transition our current customers to contracts that feature a fixed storage commitment when renewing existing agreements or upon the change in the anticipated profile of our customer. This strategy mitigates the impact of changes in physical occupancy throughout the course of the year due to seasonality, as well as other factors that can impact physical occupancy while ensuring our customers have the necessary space they need to support their business.\n\u2022these measures do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; and\n(1)The adjustments from our U.S. GAAP operating results to calculate our operating results on a constant currency basis are the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the comparable prior period.\nAcquisition, litigation and other. Corporate-level acquisition, litigation and other expenses were $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $4.3 million compared to $40.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Included in these amounts are business acquisition related costs, litigation costs associated with litigation charges outside of the normal course of business or resulting from a settlement, severance and equity acceleration costs incurred in connection with former executives, severance as a result of synergies realized from acquisitions or operational realignment, non-offering related equity issuance expenses, and terminated site operations costs. We view all of these costs as corporate in nature regardless of the segment or segments involved in certain transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $26.5 million of acquisition related expenses primarily composed of professional fees and integration related costs in connection with completed and potential acquisitions, primarily related to the recently completed Agro Merchants Acquisition, and employee retention. Additionally, we incurred $1.1 million of severance primarily related to reduction in headcount as a result of the synergies from acquisitions, and partially related to the realignment of our international operations. During the fourth quarter of 2020 we were subject to a cybersecurity incident and incurred $7.9 million of costs related to it. The cyber incident costs include third-party fees incurred in connection with the cyber incident that occurred in November 2020, as well as any incremental costs, internal and external, incurred to restore operations at our facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $24.3 million of acquisition related expenses primarily composed of professional fees and integration related costs in connection with completed and potential acquisitions, primarily related to the Cloverleaf Acquisition, and employee retention. In addition, we incurred $4.3 million of severance and equity acceleration expenses related to exited former executives and the resignation of a member of the Board of Trustees and $5.4 million of severance related to reduction in headcount as a result of the synergies created from the Cloverleaf and Lanier acquisitions and organizational realignment of our international operations. We also incurred $4.6 million of legal settlement and related litigation professional fees and $1.4 million of costs in connection with the secondary offering of\nThe 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility is broken into two tranches. Tranche A-1 is comprised of a $425.0 million USD term loan and Tranche A-2 is comprised of a CAD $250.0 million term loan, both are five-year loans maturing in 2025. Tranche A-2 provides a natural hedge for the Company's investment in the recently completed Nova Cold acquisition. We refer to Tranches A-1 and A-2 in aggregate as the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan Facility. In connection with entering into the agreement, we incurred approximately $3.2 million of debt issuance costs related to the term loan, which we amortize as interest expense under the effective interest method. As of December 31, 2020, $5.6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility are included in Mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and term loan\u201d in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDebt Covenants\nThird-party managed segment contribution (NOI) was $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $0.5 million, or 4.0%, compared to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, third-party managed segment contribution (NOI) was $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $0.4 million, or 3.8%, compared to the prior year. The increase in segment contribution was a result of the factors mentioned above.\n2013 Mortgage Loans\nIn May 2020, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC release No. 33-10786, Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses, amending Rule 1-02(w)(2) which includes amendments to certain of its rules and forms related to the disclosure of financial information regarding acquired or disposed businesses. Among other changes, the amendments impact SEC rules relating to (1) the definition of significant\u201d subsidiaries, (2) requirements to provide financial statements for significant\u201d acquisitions, and (3) revisions to the formulation and usage of pro forma financial information. The final rule is effective on January 1, 2021; however, voluntary early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted the provisions of the final rule in the third quarter of 2020. We have applied the new rules to the contemplated and completed acquisitions since the date of adoption. The Agro acquisition met the SEC's revised definition of significance, requiring one year of audited financial statements and pro forma financial information and was filed on Form 8-K/A on February 26, 2021.\nGain from sale of partially owned entities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold our interest in the China JV which resulted in the $4.3 million gain.\n\n\u2022a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio of less than or equal to 60% to unencumbered asset value. Following a material acquisition, unencumbered leverage ratio shall not exceed 65%;\nWe perform impairment testing of goodwill as of October 1 of each year, and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators and competition. As of October 1, 2020, our reporting units included the following: North American warehouse, U.S. transportation, North America third-party managed, international warehouse, international third-party managed, and international transportation. Our reporting units may change with the integration of Agro's operations in Europe, North America, South America, and Australia. However, since the Agro acquisition closed on December 30, 2020, it was not included in the 2020 annual goodwill impairment evaluation.\nSenior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility that did not participate in the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility, accordingly those lenders' portion of unamortized deferred financing costs were written off. Similarly, two lenders in the 2018 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility did not participate in the 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, and those lender's portions of unamortized deferred financing costs were written off.\nSame Store Analysis\nThe following table presents our outstanding and available indebtedness as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(1) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired and adjustments does not include $512 million of equity issued directly to Oaktree Capital, the former owners of Agro, as consideration for the Agro acquisition.\nWe may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise, we perform a quantitative impairment test. We may also perform a quantitative evaluation periodically, even if there is no change of events or circumstances.\n\n\u2022Severance costs representing certain contractual and negotiated severance and separation costs from exited former executives, reduction in headcount due to synergies achieved through acquisitions or operational efficiencies, and reduction in workforce costs associated with exiting or selling non-strategic warehouses.\n\nWarehouse segment revenue was $1.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $172.1 million, or 12.5%, compared to $1.38 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, our warehouse segment revenue was $1.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $177.7 million, or 12.9%, compared to the prior year. Approximately $158.7 million of the increase, on an actual basis, was primarily driven by acquisitions completed during 2019 and 2020, including the growth experienced period-over-period during overlapping periods of ownership. We acquired 23 warehouse facilities as a result of the Cloverleaf and Lanier acquisitions on May 1, 2019, two facilities in connection with the MHW acquisition on November 19, 2019 and one facility as a result of the PortFresh acquisition on February 1, 2019, and therefore did not have ownership of these facilities during the entirety of the comparable prior period. In 2020, we acquired 62 facilities in the warehouse segment in the Agro, AM-C, Caspers, Halls, Newport and Nova Cold acquisitions. Agro's revenue is not reflected in the operating results of our warehouse segment as the\nWarehouse segment contribution (NOI) was $520.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $72.7 million, or 16.3%, compared to $447.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, warehouse segment contribution was $521.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $74.3 million, or 16.6%, compared to the prior year. The foreign currency translation of our results of operations had a $1.6 million unfavorable impact to the warehouse segment contribution period-over-period. The increase was primarily driven by the additional facilities in the warehouse segment as a result of the aforementioned acquisitions, including the growth and synergies experienced period-over-period during overlapping periods of ownership. The remainder of the increase was driven by improvements in our core business, same store economic occupancy growth, and disciplined cost controls through the Americold Operating System of our power and other services costs, which allowed us to generate higher contribution margins. The increases were partially offset by the currency translation impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the appreciation bonus paid to front-line associates to recognize the efforts of our associates during the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in the cost of property taxes and property insurance, as well as the increase in costs related to the COVID-19 response efforts to maintain the health and safety of our associates.\nTransportation cost of operations was $123.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $3.4 million, or 2.7%, compared to $126.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, transportation cost of operations was $124.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 1.6%, compared to the prior year. Domestically, our transportation cost of operations experienced an increase due to the cost associated with transportation operations from the Hall's acquisition, which closed on November 2, 2020, and resulted in an increase of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, cost of operations increased from the Cloverleaf Acquisition, which contributed an increase of $1.2 million due to 12 months of results during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to eight months of ownership during the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding the increases in transportation cost of operations resulting from the aforementioned acquisitions, the strategic shift referenced above, paired with the impact of the foreign currency translation of our international costs, led to a decline in transportation cost of operations for the segment.\n(1)L = one-month LIBOR\nHistorically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the value of goodwill. The results of our 2020 impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of the corresponding carrying amount as of October 1, and no impairment of goodwill existed.\nFinancing Activities\nThe level and nature of throughput at our warehouses is an important factor impacting our warehouse services revenues in our warehouse segment. Throughput refers to the volume of pallets that enter and exit our warehouses. Higher levels of throughput drive warehouse services revenues in our warehouse segment as customers are typically billed on a basis that takes into account the level of throughput of the goods they store in our warehouses. The nature of throughput may be driven by the expected turn of the underlying product or commodity. Throughput pallets can be influenced both by the food manufacturers as well as shifts in demand preferences. Food manufacturers' production levels, which respond to market conditions and consumer preferences, may impact inbound pallets. Similarly, a change in inventory turnover due to shift in customer demand may impact outbound pallets.\n\n\u2022quarterly shareholder distributions.\nAlso, on May 1, 2019, we completed the Lanier Acquisition for approximately $82.5 million utilizing cash drawn from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Lanier consisted of two temperature-controlled storage facilities in Georgia serving the poultry industry. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of these facilities within our warehouse segment.\n(6)Calculated as warehouse rent and storage contribution (NOI) divided by warehouse rent and storage revenue.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nGoodwill Impairment Evaluation\n\nTransportation. We charge transportation fees, including fuel surcharges, to our customers for whom we arrange the transportation of their products. Cost of operations for our transportation segment consists primarily of third-party carrier charges, which are impacted by factors affecting those carriers. Additionally, in connection with the Cloverleaf Acquisition, we acquired trucks and associates that support certain customers within the geographic area. We supplemented our regional, national and truckload consolidation business with the Hall's acquisition, which services the Northeast corridor of the U.S. with an owned and maintained fleet. Our acquisition of Agro Merchants further expands our Transportation service offering. Agro Merchants operates its own fleet of temperature-controlled vehicles in the U.S., Ireland and UK and also offers a variety of non-asset based transportation management services. These include multi-modal global freight forwarding services to support our customers' needs.\nLoss from partially owned entities. We reported a loss of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a loss of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into the Brazil JV for which we recorded our portion of loss generated by SuperFrio. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the loss related to the China JV, which we exited during the third quarter of 2019.\n\u2022a maximum leverage ratio of less than or equal to 60% of our total asset value. Following a material acquisition, leverage ratio shall not exceed 65%;\nExpansion and development initiatives also include $20.0 million of corporate initiatives, which are projects designed to reduce future spending over the course of time. This category reflects return on investment projects, conversion of leases to owned assets, and other cost-saving initiatives.\n\u2022operating activities and overall working capital;\ncomparison against the exchange rates of such currencies at the end of the applicable periods presented herein. The rates below represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of one unit of the respective foreign currency. Amounts presented in constant currency within our results of operations are calculated by applying the average foreign exchange rate from the comparable prior year period to actual local currency results in the current period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective period. While constant currency metrics are a non-GAAP calculation and do not represent actual results, the comparison allows the reader to understand the impact of the underlying operations in addition to the impact of changing foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe Senior Unsecured Notes require compliance with leverage ratios, secured and unsecured indebtedness ratios, and unsecured indebtedness to qualified assets ratios. In addition, we are required to maintain at all times a credit rating for each series of notes from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The 2018 Senior Unsecured Notes agreement includes the following financial covenants:\n(6)Non-same store warehouse count of 94 includes 46 warehouses acquired through the Agro acquisition on December 30, 2020, eight warehouses acquired through the Hall's acquisition on November 2, 2020, three warehouses acquired through the Casper's and AM-C warehouse acquisitions on August 31, 2020, and five warehouses acquired through the Nova Cold and Newport acquisitions on January 2, 2020. The results of these acquisitions are reflected in the results above since date of ownership. The operational results from one day of ownership of the Agro warehouses is immaterial to the three months and year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe acquisition method of accounting also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record future impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense.\nOn September 24, 2019, we reduced our interest rate margins from 1.45% to 1.00% and decreased the fee on unused borrowing capacity by 5 basis points for usage greater than 50% of the total commitment and 15 basis points for usage less than 50% of commitment. The fee for unused borrowing capacity was 20 basis points regardless of the percentage of total commitment used. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company received a favorable credit rating. This rating, when combined with existing ratings, allowed the Company to transition to a favorable ratings-based pricing grid during the third quarter of 2019.\n(2)C=one month CDOR\nOn February 1, 2019, we completed the PortFresh Acquisition for a purchase price of approximately $35.9 million, utilizing available cash on hand. PortFresh consisted of one facility operating near the port of Savannah, Georgia and adjacent land upon which we have constructed a newly developed facility. This newly constructed facility received its certificate of occupancy during the second quarter of 2020. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of the acquired facility within our Warehouse segment.\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated will often have to be replaced in the future and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\n\u2022these measures do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness;\nRevenue Recognition\nOur bad debt expense was $1.6 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we maintained bad debt allowances of approximately $12.3 million, which we believed to be adequate.\nOur primary revenue source consists of rent, storage and warehouse services revenues. Additionally, we charge transportation fees to those customers who use our transportation services, where we act as the principal in the arrangement of the services. We also receive a reimbursement of substantially all expenses for warehouses that we manage on behalf of third-party owners, with all reimbursements recognized as revenues under the relevant accounting guidance. We also earn management fees, incentive fees upon achieving negotiated performance and cost-savings results, or an applicable mark-up on costs. Revenues from storage and handling are recognized over the period consistent with the transfer of the service to the customer. Multiple contracts with a single counterparty are accounted for as separate arrangements. We recognize transportation fees and expenses on a gross basis upon delivery of products on behalf of our customers. We also recognize management fees and related expense reimbursements as revenues as we perform management services and incur the expense.\nOn March 26, 2020, we entered into a five-year Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility and a four-year $800 million Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which we refer to as the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. The proceeds were used to refinance the existing $800 million 2018 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility maturing January 23, 2021 and USD denominated $475 million 2018 Senior Unsecured Term Loan maturing January 23, 2023. The total borrowing capacity of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is approximately $1.4 billion USD. The Company reduced the margin on 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility and 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility by five basis points.\n\nGain from sale of real estate. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $22.1 million gain from the sale of real estate. On June 19, 2020, we completed the sale of a facility in our Warehouse segment, and began to transition the business to other nearby facilities, resulting in a $20.1 million gain from sale of real estate. On January 31, 2020, we received official notice from a customer to exercise its contractual call option to purchase land from us in Sydney, Australia, which we previously purchased for future development. We received sale proceeds upon exercise of the call option during the first quarter of 2020, resulting in a $2.5 million gain on sale.\n\n(b)Last participating and fixed dividend paid to holders of Series B Preferred Shares in connection with the conversion to common shares on the IPO date.\nThe following table presents the operating results of our quarry segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We sold our quarry business on July 1, 2020.\nWe also analyze the segment contribution (NOI) margin\u201d for each of our business segments, which we calculate as segment contribution (NOI) divided by segment revenues.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 and primarily consisted of $1.3 billion paid for the acquisitions of Cloverleaf and Lanier, $85.2 million paid for the acquisitions of real estate, which related to the asset acquisitions of Portfresh and MHW, and $217.2 million used in additions to property, buildings and equipment. These cash outflows were partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of our investment in the China JV for $14.3 million and $2.0 million return of investment in a joint venture during 2019.\nThroughout 2020, revenue growth has been driven by the impact of acquisitions. Additionally, we experienced higher than seasonal grocery demand within the retail sector due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this was mostly offset by decreased consumption in the food services sector due to stay-at-home orders and continued social distancing which resulted in lower services revenue due to the shift in demand. Later in the second quarter of 2020, the food service sector volumes began to increase as re-opening plans were implemented but still significantly lower than the prior comparable period. The increase was also partially due to higher economic occupancy in our same-store pool from higher commodity holdings and a slowdown in food service activity and exports, coupled with an increase in fixed committed contracts. The remaining increase was primarily due to a more favorable customer mix, improvements in our commercial terms and contractual rate escalations, the incremental revenue from our expansion of the Rochelle, Illinois facility and the opening of the development in Savannah. The foreign currency translation of revenue received by our foreign operations had a $5.6 million unfavorable impact during the year ended December 31, 2020, which was mainly driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the Australian dollar and to a lesser extent the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the Argentine peso.\n\u2022Equity acceleration costs representing the unrecognized expense for share-based awards that vest and convert to common shares in advance of the original negotiated vesting date and any other equity award changes resulting in accounting for the award as a modification.\n(3)During the first quarter of 2020, the Company refinanced its Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. As such, the 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility was in effect as of December 31, 2020 and the 2018 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility was in effect as of December 31, 2019. The above disclosure reflects N/A for the reporting date that the respective instrument was not in effect.\nOur corporate-level acquisition, litigation and other expenses consist of costs that we view outside of selling, general and administrative expenses with a high level of variability from period-to-period, and include the following:\n(7)Calculated as warehouse services contribution (NOI) divided by warehouse services revenue.\n We calculate EBITDA for Real Estate, or EBITDAre, in accordance with the standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, defined as, earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property, including gains or losses on change of control, impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustment to reflect share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. EBITDAre is a measure commonly used in our industry, and we present EBITDAre to enhance investor understanding of our operating performance. We believe that EBITDAre provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and useful life of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. We also calculate our Core EBITDA as EBITDAre further adjusted for acquisition, litigation and other expenses, bridge loan commitment fees, impairment of long-lived assets, loss on debt extinguishment and modification, share-based compensation expense, foreign currency exchange gain or loss, loss or gain on other asset disposals, loss or income on partially owned entities and reduction in EBITDAre from partially owned entities. We believe that the presentation of Core EBITDA provides a measurement of our operations that is meaningful to investors because it excludes the effects of certain items that are otherwise included in EBITDAre but which we do not believe are indicative of our core business operations. EBITDAre and Core EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and our EBITDAre and Core EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider our EBITDAre and Core EBITDA as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our calculations of EBITDAre and Core EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, including: \nSeveral years ago, we initiated a strategic shift in our transportation segment services and solutions. The intention of this strategic shift was to better focus our business on the operation of our temperature-controlled warehouses. Specifically, we have gradually exited certain commoditized, non-scalable, or low margin services we historically offered to our customers, in favor of more profitable and value-added programs, such as regional, national, truckload and retailer-specific multi-vendor consolidation services. We designed each value-added program to improve efficiency and reduce transportation and logistics costs to our warehouse customers, whose transportation spend typically represents the majority of their supply-chain costs. We believe this efficiency and cost reduction helps to drive increased client retention, as well as maintain high occupancy levels in our temperature-controlled warehouses. Over the last several years, we have made significant progress in implementing our strategic initiative of growing our transportation service offering in a way that complements our temperature-controlled warehouse business, for example, we have also added a dedicated fleet service offering through acquisitions. We intend to continue executing this strategy in the future.\nA detailed discussion of the 2020 year-over-year changes can be found below and a detailed discussion of the 2019 year-over-year changes can be found in Item 7.

We also include integration costs pre- and post-acquisition that reflect work being performed to facilitate merger and acquisition integration, such as employee retention expense and work associated with information systems and other projects including spending to support future acquisitions, which primarily consist of professional services.\n\u2022a minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio of greater than or equal to 1.75x.\nacquisition closed on December 30, 2020 with only one day of results for the year ended December 31, 2020. We consider the results to be immaterial and have excluded it for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSEC Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses\n(1) At the beginning of 2020 we reclassified one facility in our portfolio to the same store population from the non-same store population as a result of achieving normalized operations, two facilities were reclassified from to our non-same store population from our same store population as a result of the redevelopment impact to the Atlanta Major Market Strategy that is in progress, and one facility that was in the same-store population was sold. During 2020, we acquired four facilities in connection with the Nova Cold Acquisition, one facility in connection with the Newport Acquisition, two facilities in connection with the AM-C Acquisition, one facility in connection with the Caspers Acquisition, eight facilities in connection with the Halls Acquisition and 46 facilities in connection with the Agro Acquisition, all of which were added to the non-same store population. Additionally, during 2020 we completed a development upon land that was acquired in connection with the PortFresh Acquisition, which was added to the non-same store population.\nFinally, we incurred approximately $10.6 million for contemplated future expansion or development projects.\nThe expansion and development expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 are primarily driven by $74.8 million related to Plainville, Connecticut and $73.3 million related to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which are our two fully-automated development sites for Ahold Delhaize, $62.2 million related to the ongoing Atlanta major markets strategy project, $12.5 million in construction costs related to our Savannah expansion site, which was completed during the second quarter of 2020 and $22.0 million related to the Auckland, New Zealand expansion project which was started during the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2020, we invested $11.7 million in our Russellville expansion.\nOn November 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of New Jersey based Halls Warehouse Corporation for $489.2 million. Halls consisted of eight facilities near the Port of Newark. Halls also provides transportation\n(a)Declared in December 2018 and included in the $28.2 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\nOn December 30, 2020, we repaid $100.0 million of the 425000000 USD Tranche A-1 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A. This was funded using the Series D and E debt private placement issuance, more details on this debt issuance can be found under the Series A, B, C, D, and E Senior Unsecured Notes\u201d section below. In connection with this repayment, approximately $1.5 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility were written off. In addition, the interest rate swaps associated with the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A were terminated, resulting in an extinguishment fee of $16.4 million. After accounting for the refinance, the total borrowing capacity of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is approximately $1.3 billion USD.\nForeign Currency Translation Impact on Our Operations\nconsistent with the characteristics of the relevant warehouse. On a warehouse by warehouse basis, rack space generally ranges from three to four feet depending upon the type of facility and the nature of the customer goods stored therein. The number of our pallet positions is reviewed and updated quarterly, taking into account changes in racking configurations and room utilization.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $215.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $52.5 million, or 32.2%, compared to $163.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the 2019 and 2020 acquisitions, expansions and developments.\nOur business could be impacted due to inflation. We believe, however, that we are well positioned to be able to manage our business in an inflationary environment. Certain of our expenses are subject to normal inflationary pressures and this could lead to increases in the operating costs of our properties, such as wages and benefits, insurance, real estate taxes, utility expenses, equipment repair and replacement and other operating expenses. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases with increased operating efficiencies and the ability to increase prices in our customer contracts (many of which contain provisions for inflationary price escalators), we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies or increased storage or service charges.\n(5)Calculated as warehouse services contribution (NOI) divided by warehouse services revenue.\nQuarry revenue was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $4.2 million, or 48.8%, compared to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Quarry cost of operations was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $3.5 million, or 45.0%, compared to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in both revenues and cost of operations was a result of the sale of the limestone quarry which closed on July 1, 2020.\nAcquisitions\n(d)Declared in June and included in the $27.3 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\nTo the extent possible, estimates have been considered and recorded, as appropriate, for the items above based on the information available as of December 31, 2020. We will continue to evaluate these items until they are satisfactorily resolved and adjust our acquisition accounting accordingly, within the allowable measurement period (not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition), as defined by ASC 805.\nOur discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods described is based on our audited consolidated financial statements and our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, each of which has been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these historical financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For more information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following critical accounting discussion pertains to accounting policies management believes are most critical to the portrayal of our historical financial condition and results of operations and that require significant, difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to those of other companies.\n\u2022Non-offering related equity issuance expenses whether incurred through our initial public offering, follow-on offerings or secondary offerings.\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 3.1%, compared to $94.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in interest expense on the unhedged portion of our Senior Unsecured Term Loan A\nOur consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our operations outside the United States. Future fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and their impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations are inherently uncertain. As a result of the relative size of our international operations, these fluctuations may be material on our results of operations. Our revenues and expenses from our international operations are typically denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred. Therefore, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations and margins is partially mitigated.\nCredit Ratings\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6.9 million, which represented an increase of $1.7 million, from an income tax benefit of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to recognition by our U.S. TRS of a deferred income tax benefit to reduce its valuation allowance by $2.0 million. The reduction in the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to net deferred tax liabilities acquired that are a positive source of income for valuation allowance assessment purposes. This deferred income tax benefit was offset by an increase in income tax expense of $0.3 million primarily attributable to our foreign operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, there were 7,440,532 common shares sold under the 2020 ATM Equity Program, resulting in gross proceeds of $272.6 million. The proceeds were offset by $3.0 million of fees. Included in the shares sold under the 2020 ATM Equity Program were forward sale agreements to sell 4,346,101 common shares for gross proceeds of $162.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company settled 5,011,428 common shares for gross proceeds of $183.0 million under its ATM equity program. Pursuant to the respective forward sale agreements, the remaining 2,428,604 of shares must be settled by September 1, 2021 for gross proceeds of $89.6 million.\nWe have completed various acquisitions over the past year, which have increased our consolidated goodwill balance. On January 2, 2020, the Company completed the acquisitions of Nova Cold and Newport. The resulting intangible assets included goodwill of $71.7 million for the warehouse segment. On August 31, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of AM-C. The resulting intangible assets included goodwill of $10.4 million for the warehouse segment. The goodwill from Nova Cold, Newport, and AM-C was included in the annual goodwill impairment test as these acquisitions closed prior to October 1, 2020.\nThird-Party Managed. We receive a reimbursement of substantially all expenses for warehouses that we manage on behalf of third-party owners, with all reimbursements recognized as revenues under the relevant accounting guidance. We also earn management fees, incentive fees upon achieving negotiated performance and cost-savings results, or an applicable mark-up on costs. Cost of operations for our third-party managed segment is reimbursed on a pass-through basis (typically within two weeks).\nOperating Activities\nOn December 4, 2018, we entered into the 2018 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility to, among other things, (i) increase the revolver borrowing capacity from $450 million to $800 million, (ii) convert the credit facility (term loan and revolver) from a secured credit facility to an unsecured credit facility, and (iii) decrease the applicable interest rate margins from 2.35% to 1.45% and decrease the fee on unused borrowing capacity by 5 basis points. The terms of the revolver allow for the ability to draw proceeds in multiple currencies, up to $400 million. In connection with entering into the original agreement and subsequent amendments for the Term Loan A Credit Facility, we incurred approximately $8.9 million of debt issuance costs, which we amortize as interest expense under the effective interest method. As of December 31, 2019, the unamortized balance of Term Loan A debt issuance costs was $6.1 million and was included in Mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and term loans\u201d on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur net cash provided by financing activities was $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash provided by financing activities for the current period primarily consisted of $1.6 billion net proceeds from equity offerings during 2020, the $922.4 million received in connection with the issuance of the Series D and Series E senior unsecured notes which was partially offset by the related debt issuance costs of $10.1 million, the $177.1 million received in connection with the refinancing of our Senior Unsecured Term Loan and $636.8 million in proceeds from our revolving line of credit. These cash inflows were partially offset by $627.1 million of repayment on our revolving line of credit using the proceeds from the issuance of the Series D and Series E senior unsecured notes, $167.1 million of distributions paid, $156.8 million of repayments on term loan and mortgage notes and $23.7 million of payments related to lease obligations.\n(a)Declared in December 2019 and included in the $38.8 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\nExternal growth expenditures represent asset acquisitions or business combinations. Expansion and development capital expenditures are investments made to support both our customers and our warehouse expansion and development initiatives. It also includes investments in enhancing our information technology platform. Examples of capital expenditures associated with expansion and development initiatives include funding of construction costs, increases to warehouse capacity and pallet positions, acquisitions of reusable incremental material handling equipment, and implementing energy efficiency projects, such as thermal energy storage, LED lighting, motion-sensor technology, variable frequency drives for our fans and compressors, rapid-close doors and alternative-power generation technologies. Examples of capital expenditures to enhance our information technology platform include the delivery of new systems and software and customer interface functionality.\n\n\u2022a minimum unsecured debt service ratio of greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00.\n(5)Calculated as warehouse services revenue less labor and other services costs.\nCOVID-19\nWe evaluate the performance of our primary business segments based on their contribution (NOI) to our overall results of operations. We use the term segment contribution (NOI)\u201d to mean a segment's revenues less its cost of operations (excluding any depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses and corporate-level acquisition, litigation and other expenses). We use segment contribution (NOI) to evaluate our segments for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance in accordance with FASB ASC, Topic 280, Segment Reporting.\n\nCost of operations for our warehouse segment consists of power, other facilities costs, labor, and other services costs. Labor, the largest component of the cost of operations from our warehouse segment, consists primarily of employee wages, benefits, and workers' compensation. Trends in our labor expense are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, changes in customer requirements, workforce productivity, variability in costs associated with medical insurance and the impact of workplace safety programs, inclusive of the number and severity of workers' compensation claims. Labor expense is also impacted as a result of discretionary bonuses. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have incorporated certain inefficiencies such as staggered break schedules, social distancing, and other changes to process, all of which we expect to continue\nThird-party managed cost of operations was $279.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $38.3 million, or 15.9%, compared to $241.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, third-party managed cost of operations was $279.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $38.6 million, or 16.0%, compared to the prior year. The increase was a result of higher business volume and is in line with the increase in revenues, partially offset by the exit of the facilities described above.\nSubsequent to the acquisition of MHW, during the first quarter of 2020, we exercised our call option to purchase land from the holder of the ground lease for $4.1 million. We also invested an additional $4.7 million for the Rochelle facility, which was previously opened during the second quarter of 2019.\nThroughput pallets at our same stores were 25.1 million pallets for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of 2.7% from 25.8 million pallets for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was the result of the COVID related impacts in various sectors and commodities, including the initial surge and ongoing elevated demand from our grocery retail sector, offset by the decrease in throughput in the food service sector and protein commodity. Same store warehouse services revenue per throughput pallet increased 4.1% compared to the prior year primarily as a result of contractual rate escalations, favorable business mix and an increase in higher-priced, value-added warehouse services such as repackaging, blast freezing, and case-picking, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation as previously discussed. On a constant currency basis, our same store services revenue per throughput pallet increased 4.4% compared to the prior year.\n(e)Declared in September and included in the $28.1 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\nSame Store Analysis\nOutstanding Indebtedness\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 one customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues, with revenues received of $257.3 million, $211.1 million and $212.8 million, respectively. The substantial majority of this customer's business relates to our third-party managed segment. We are reimbursed for substantially all expenses we incur in managing warehouses on behalf of third-party owners. We recognize these reimbursements as revenues under applicable accounting guidance, but generally do not affect our financial results because they are offset by the corresponding expenses that we recognize in our third-party managed segment cost of operations. Of the revenues received from this customer, $241.8 million, $195.4 million, and $196.3 million represented reimbursements for certain expenses we incurred during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that were offset by matching expenses included in our third-party managed cost of operations.\nThe maturity of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility is March 26, 2024, with the option to extend the maturity up to two times, each for a six-month period. In order to extend, the Company must not be in default, all representations and warranties must be in effect, obtain updated resolutions from loan parties, and an additional 6.25 bps extension fee must be paid. In connection with entering into the agreement, we incurred approximately $5.2 million of debt issuance costs for the 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which we amortize as interest expense under the straight-line method. Unamortized deferred financing costs as of December 31, 2019 of $2.8 million will continue to be amortized over the life of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, $5.8 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the revolving credit facility are included in Other assets\u201d in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\u2022a maximum secured leverage ratio of less than or equal to 40% to total asset value. Following a material acquisition, secured leverage ratio shall not exceed 45%;\n8, 2020. The notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed by the Company and the subsidiaries of the Company. The Company applied the proceeds of the private placement transaction to repay the indebtedness outstanding under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility incurred in connection with the funding of the Cloverleaf and Lanier acquisitions.\nExpansion and development\nAfter considering the common shares issued during 2020 and the shares subject to the forward sale agreements, the Company had approximately $227.4 million of availability remaining for distribution under the 2020 ATM Equity Program as of December 31, 2020.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our net cash provided by operating activities was $293.7 million, an increase of $57.5 million, or 24.3%, compared to $236.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is due to higher segment contribution in our same store results and as a result of our acquisitions during 2019 and 2020.\n(d)Declared in September and included in the $38.8 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\nto incur going forward. Our second largest cost of operations from our warehouse segment is power utilized in the operation of our temperature-controlled warehouses. As a result, trends in the price for power in the regions where we operate may have a significant effect on our financial results. We may from time to time hedge our exposure to changes in power prices through fixed rate agreements or, to the extent possible and appropriate, through rate escalations or power surcharge provisions within our customer contracts. Additionally, business mix impacts power expense depending on the temperature zone or type of freezing required. Other facilities costs include utilities other than power, property insurance, property taxes, sanitation (which include incremental supplies as a result of COVID-19), repairs and maintenance on real estate, rent under real property operating leases, where applicable, security, and other related facilities costs. Other services costs include equipment costs, warehouse consumables (e.g., shrink-wrap and uniforms), personal protective equipment to maintain the health and safety of our associates, warehouse administration and other related services costs.\nWe incur repair and maintenance expenses that include costs of normal maintenance and repairs and minor replacements that do not materially extend the life of the property or provide future economic benefits. Repair and maintenance expenses consist of expenses related to our existing temperature-controlled warehouse network and its existing supporting personal property and are reflected as operating expenses on our income statement. Examples of repair and maintenance expenses related to our warehouse portfolio include ordinary repair and maintenance on roofs, racking, walls, doors, parking lots and refrigeration equipment. Examples of repair and maintenance expenses related to personal property include ordinary repair and maintenance expenses on material handling equipment (e.g., fork lifts and pallet jacks) and related batteries. The following table sets forth our repair and maintenance expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nBy operation of law and in accordance with our customer contracts (other than leases), we typically receive warehouseman's liens on products held in our warehouses to secure customer payments. Such liens permit us to take control of the products and sell them to third parties in order to recover any monies receivable on a delinquent account, but such products may be perishable or otherwise not available to us for re-sale. Historically, in instances where we have warehouseman's liens and our customer sought bankruptcy protection, we have been successful in receiving critical vendor\u201d status, which has allowed us to fully collect on our accounts receivable during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceeding.\nInflation\n(1)The adjustments from our U.S. GAAP operating results to calculate our operating results on a constant currency basis are the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the comparable prior period.\nAdditionally, on August 31, 2020, we completed the acquisition of AM-C Warehouses for cash consideration of approximately $82.7 million, utilizing available cash on hand. AM-C Warehouses consisted of an owned facility in Mansfield, Texas and a leased facility in Grand Prairie, Texas. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of these facilities within our warehouse segment.\nWe define our same store\u201d population once a year at the beginning of the current calendar year. Our same store population includes properties that were owned or leased for the entirety of two comparable periods and that have reported at least twelve months of consecutive normalized operations prior to January 1 of the prior calendar year. We define normalized operations\u201d as properties that have been open for operation or lease after development or significant modification, including the expansion of a warehouse footprint or a warehouse rehabilitation subsequent to an event, such as a natural disaster or similar event causing disruption to operations. In addition, our definition of normalized operations\u201d takes into account changes in the ownership structure (e.g., purchase of a previously leased warehouse would result in different charges in the compared periods), which would impact comparability in our warehouse segment contribution (NOI).\nThe following table presents other items of income and expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nWe are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including how it will impact our customers and business partners. While we have not experienced significant disruptions on our operations from the COVID-19 pandemic thus far, we are unable to predict the future impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties arising from the pandemic. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with any degree of confidence, including the scope, severity, duration and geographies of the outbreak, the actions taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic or mitigate its impact as requested or mandated by governmental authorities or otherwise voluntarily taken by individuals or businesses, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the outbreak and containment measures, among others. Our business is deemed an essential business\u201d as defined by the Department of Homeland Security, which means that our associates are able to continue working in our facilities during shelter-in-place\u201d or stay-at-home\u201d orders. The outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States and other countries in which we operate, has significantly adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has led many nations, states and local authorities to institute shelter-in-place\u201d or stay-at-home\u201d orders, mandate business and school closures and restrict travel. Certain states and cities, including where we own properties, have development sites and where our principal place of business is located, have also reacted by instituting restrictions on travel, shelter in place\u201d rules, restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate, and/or restrictions on the types of construction projects that may continue. Many states and cities have begun implementing reopening\u201d plans, however, these restrictions vary widely by jurisdiction and may continue to change as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses. The negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are pervasive across a broad spectrum of industries, including industries in which we, our customers and business partners operate. Negative impacts from COVID-19 may negatively impact the business and operations of our customers and business partners (including our suppliers). Further, the impacts of a potentially worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets, consumer and business spending as well as other unanticipated consequences continue to remain unknown. The impacts of locations of outbreaks and actions mandated by governmental authorities or taken voluntarily by businesses and individuals to contain or mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and the timing of the repeal or loosening of such restrictions are also unknown. As a result, we cannot at this time predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. Refer to Risk Factors - Risks Related to Public Health Crises - We face various risks and uncertainties related to public health crises, including the recent and ongoing global outbreak of the novel coronavirus and variants (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic is growing and its impacts are uncertain and hard to measure and may have a material adverse effect on us.\nMaintenance capital expenditures are capitalized investments made to extend the life of, and provide future economic benefit from, our existing temperature-controlled warehouse network and its existing supporting personal property and information technology systems. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures related to our existing temperature-controlled warehouse network include replacing roofs and refrigeration equipment, and upgrading our racking systems. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures related to personal property include expenditures on material handling equipment (e.g., fork lifts and pallet jacks) and related batteries. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures related to information technology include expenditures on existing servers, networking equipment and current software. Maintenance capital expenditures do not include acquisition costs contemplated when underwriting the purchase of a building or costs which are incurred to bring a building up to Americold's operating standards. The following table sets forth our recurring maintenance capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nAs a result of the Cloverleaf Acquisition on May 1, 2019, we acquired expansion projects which were substantially completed during 2019. We incurred an additional $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 for these expansion projects.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Business and Financial Results\n\u2022Other costs relate to additional superannuation pension costs related to prior years upon review by the Australian Tax Office.\nAcquisitions and Joint Ventures\n(3)Includes non-real estate rent expense (equipment lease and rentals) of $9.4 million and $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSecurity Interests in Customers' Products\n\u2022a maximum total secured indebtedness ratio of less than 0.40 to 1.00;\nWe expect to utilize the same sources of capital we will rely on to meet our short-term liquidity requirements to also meet our long-term liquidity requirements, which include funding our operating activities, our debt service obligations and shareholder distributions, and our future development and acquisition activities. As previously discussed, the COVID-19 pandemic has created disruption among several industries. The outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. While we did not incur significant disruption during the year ended December 31, 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to predict the impact that the pandemic may have on the sources of capital upon which we rely.\nThe 2013 Mortgage Loans are collateralized by 15 warehouses. The terms governing the 2013 Mortgage Loans require us to maintain certain cash amounts in accounts that are restricted as to their use for the respective warehouses. As of December 31, 2020, the amount of restricted cash associated with the 2013 Mortgage Loans was $3.6 million. Additionally, if we do not maintain certain financial thresholds, including a debt service coverage ratio of 1.10x, the cash generated will further be temporarily restricted and limited to the use for scheduled debt service and operating costs. The 2013 Mortgage Loans are non-recourse to us subject to customary non-recourse carve-outs.\n(b)Declared in March and included in the $42.6 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into business combinations. In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations\u201d, we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is assigned to each reporting unit based upon the expected proportionate gross margin. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, land and buildings and improvements. Significant estimates and assumptions include subjective and/or complex judgments regarding items such as revenue growth rates, operating costs and margins, capital expenditures, tax rates, long-term growth rates, discount rates, customer attrition rates, economic lives and other factors, including estimating future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. The significant assumptions impacting the fair value of the acquired real property include estimates of indirect costs and entrepreneurial profit on the transaction, which were added to the replacement cost of the acquired assets in order to estimate their fair value in the market.\n(2) During 2020, we exited two third-party managed warehouses, which were not renewed upon expiration of the operating agreement.\nQuarry Segment\n(c)Declared in May and included in the $43.3 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\nOn August 26, 2019, we entered into an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate sales price of $500.0 million of our common shares through an ATM equity program (an ATM Equity Program\u201d). There were no common shares sold under the ATM Equity Program during the first quarter of 2020. On April 16, 2020, this ATM Equity Program was terminated and replaced with a new ATM Equity Program, pursuant to which we may sell up to an aggregate sales price of $500.0 million of our common shares. Sales of our common shares made pursuant to the ATM Equity Program may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be at the market\u201d offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the NYSE, or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange, or as otherwise agreed between the applicable agent and us. Sales may also be made on a forward basis pursuant to separate forward sale agreements. We intend to use any net proceeds from sales of our common shares pursuant to the new ATM Equity Program for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, which may include funding development, expansion and acquisitions opportunities and the repayment of outstanding indebtedness.\nSeries A, B, C, D, and E Senior Unsecured Notes\nExternal Growth, Expansion and Development Capital Expenditures\nLoss on debt extinguishment, modifications and termination of derivative instruments\nImpairment of long-lived assets. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded impairment charges of $8.2 million and $13.5 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded impairment charges of $3.7 million for Quarry segment assets related to the sale of our quarry business, $2.1 million for Third-party managed segment assets within the leased facilities that we exited which could not be repurposed, $1.7 million for Warehouse segment assets related to a potential development project which we are no longer moving forward with and $0.5 million for Warehouse segment assets which were deemed unusable subsequent to the sale of our Boston facility. During the first quarter of 2019, management and our Board of Trustees formally approved the Atlanta Major Market Strategy\u201d plan which included the partial redevelopment of an existing warehouse facility. The partial redevelopment required the demolition of 75% of the current warehouse. As a result of this initiative, we recorded an impairment charge of $9.6 million during the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $2.9 million related to a domestic idle warehouse facility in anticipation of sale of the asset, which was completed during the second quarter of 2019. Each of these impaired assets previously mentioned related to the Warehouse segment. In addition, during the second quarter of 2019, management determined that certain international transportation related assets were going to be idled and we recorded an impairment charge of $0.9 million as a result. These impaired assets related to the transportation segment.\nAlso, on January 2, 2020, we completed the purchase of all outstanding membership interests of Newport Cold for cash consideration of $57.7 million, utilizing available cash on hand. Newport Cold consists of a single temperature-controlled warehouse located in St. Paul, Minnesota. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of this facility within our warehouse segment.\nThe following table sets forth our acquisitions, expansion and development capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands).\nSame store rent and storage revenues per economic occupied pallet increased 1.3% period-over-period, primarily driven by improvements in our commercial terms and contractual rate escalations. On a constant currency basis, our same store rent and storage revenues per occupied pallet increased 1.8% period-over-period.\nLoss on debt extinguishment, modifications and termination of derivative instruments. During the first quarter of 2020 we refinanced our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, which resulted in the write-off of certain unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.8 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we closed on a debt private placement of \u20ac750 million senior unsecured notes. In connection with this issuance, we repaid $100.0 million of our outstanding Senior Unsecured Term Loan A-1 facility, resulting in a write-off of $1.5 million of unamortized deferred financing costs. In connection with the partial repayment of this debt we also terminated the related interest rate swaps, resulting in the recognition of a portion of the remaining unamortized balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the previously designated hedges for $7.7 million. The unamortized balance of $8.7 million will be recognized through 2024. No such costs were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOther. In addition to our primary business segments, we owned and operated a limestone quarry in Carthage, Missouri for the first half of 2020. Revenues were generated from the sale of limestone mined at our quarry. Cost of operations for our quarry consisted primarily of labor, equipment, fuel and explosives. The sale of our quarry business segment was completed on July 1, 2020.\nWarehouse Segment\nOn November 6, 2018, we completed a debt private placement transaction consisting of (i) $200.0 million senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 4.68% due January 8, 2026 ( Series A\u201d) and (ii) $400.0 million senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 4.86% due January 8, 2029 ( Series B\u201d), collectively referred to as the debt private placement. The transaction closed on December 4, 2018. Interest is paid on January 8 and July 8 of each year until maturity, with the first payment occurring July 8, 2019. The notes are our general unsecured senior obligations and are guaranteed by us and our subsidiaries. We applied a portion of the proceeds of the debt private placement to complete the defeasance of the $600.0 million Americold 2010 LLC Trust, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2010, ART, or the 2010 Mortgage Loans. We applied the remaining proceeds to the Australian term loan and the New Zealand term loan, or the ANZ Loans.\nOn March 6, 2020, we acquired a 14.99% ownership interest in Superfrio Armaz\u00e9ns Gerais S.A. (SuperFrio) for Brazil Real Dollars of R$117.8 million, or approximately USD $25.7 million, inclusive of certain legal fees. We funded the purchase price using cash on hand. Our pro-rata share of the Brazil JV's results are included within (Loss) income from investments in partially owned entities\u201d. As of December 31, 2020, SuperFrio owns or operates 22 temperature-controlled warehouses in Brazil.\nOur results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes the four months for the activity of the AM-C and Caspers acquisitions, and the two months for the activity of the Halls acquisition. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes the one month and partial period of November for the activity of the MHW Acquisition, eight months of activity for the Cloverleaf Acquisition and Lanier Acquisition, and eleven months of activity for the PortFresh Acquisition. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\n\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nManagement's Overview\nAcquired properties will be included in the same store\u201d population if owned by us as of the first business day of each year, of the prior calendar year and still owned by us as of the end of the current reporting period, unless the property is under development. The same store\u201d pool is also adjusted to remove properties that were sold or entering development subsequent to the beginning of the current calendar year. As such, the same store\u201d population for the period ended December 31, 2020 includes all properties that we owned at January 2, which had both been owned and had reached normalized operations\u201d by January 2, 2019.\n\nTo perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. The estimation of the net present value of future cash flows is based upon varying economic assumptions, including significant assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating costs and margins, capital expenditures, tax rates, long-term growth rates and discount\nOur Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities, the Senior Unsecured Notes and 2013 Mortgage Loans all require financial statement reporting, periodic reporting of compliance with financial covenants, other established thresholds and performance measurements, and compliance with affirmative and negative covenants that govern our allowable business practices. The affirmative and negative covenants include continuation of insurance, maintenance of collateral, the maintenance of REIT status, and our ability to enter into certain types of transactions or exposures in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\n(4)During the first quarter of 2020, the Company refinanced its Senior Unsecured Term Loan A. As such, the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility was in effect as of December 31, 2020 and the 2018 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility was in effect as of December 31, 2019.\nThroughput at our Warehouses\nThird-Party Managed Segment\nOn January 29, 2021, the Company expanded its 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility by $200 million. In addition, the Company paid $200 million of principal on Tranche A-1 of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan. The maturity, margin, and other terms of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility remain unchanged.\nOn January 2, 2020, we completed the purchase of all outstanding shares of Nova Cold for cash consideration of C$338.7 million (USD $260.6 million). Nova Cold consisted of four temperature-controlled facilities in Toronto, Calgary and Halifax. The acquisition was funded utilizing proceeds from the settlement of our April 2019 forward sale agreement combined with funds drawn on our 2018 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of these facilities within our warehouse segment.\n\nThe acquisitions completed during the first quarter of 2020 relate to Newport and Nova Cold. The acquisitions completed during the third quarter of 2020 relate to AM-C Warehouses and Caspers. The acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter of 2020 related to Hall's and Agro. The acquisitions completed during 2019 relate to Cloverleaf, Lanier, PortFresh, and MHW, and excludes amounts related to the assets under construction for expansion and development projects, further detailed below.\nOur net cash used in investing activities was $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash used for the acquisitions of Agro, AM-C, Hall's, Newport and Nova Cold and accounted for as business combinations totaled $1.9 billion. Cash used in the acquisition of real estate was $25.5 million, which related to the asset acquisition of Caspers during the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, the net payment in settlement of a foreign currency forward contract in connection with the issuance of the Series D and Series E senior unsecured notes was $45.0 million. Additions to property, buildings and equipment were $376.8 million and $217.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in additions to property, buildings and equipment were driven by the Ahold, Atlanta, New Zealand, Savannah, Calgary, and Russellville expansion and development projects. Additionally, we invested $26.2 million in the Brazil JV during the first quarter of 2020. These outflows were offset by $80.2 million in proceeds from the sale of land and property, buildings, and equipment related to the sale of land in Sydney, the Quarry segment and the sale of the Boston facility.\nMaintenance Capital Expenditures and Repair and Maintenance Expenses\nHistorically Significant Customer\n\n\u2022our 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility;\nOn December 30, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Agro Merchants for total consideration of $1.59 billion, including cash received of $47.5 million. This was comprised of cash consideration totaling $1.08 billion, of which $49.7 million was deferred, and the issuance of 14,166,667 common shares of beneficial interest to Oaktree, with a fair value of $512.1 million based upon the closing share price on December 29, 2020 of $36.15. Financing lease and sale-leaseback obligations associated with the acquisition totaled $119.9 million, and when added to the total consideration transferred brings the total transaction cost to approximately $1.7 billion. The one business day of results was immaterial to the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. Agro Merchants operates more than 236 million cubic feet of temperature-controlled warehouse and distribution space across 46 facilities and provides transportation services in the United States, Europe, Australia and Chile. We expect to report the results of these facilities within our warehouse segment in 2021, and the results of the transportation operations within our transportation segment in 2021.\nOur 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility contains representations, covenants and other terms customary for a publicly traded REIT. In addition, it contains certain financial covenants, as defined in the credit agreement, including:\nIn March 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted amendments to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X and created Rule 13-01 to simplify disclosure requirements related to certain registered securities. The rule is effective January 4, 2021 but earlier compliance is permitted. The Company and the Operating Partnership have filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC registering, among other securities, debt securities of the Operating Partnership, which will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. As a result of the amendments to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, subsidiary issuers of obligations guaranteed by the parent are not required to provide separate financial statements, provided that the subsidiary obligor is consolidated into the parent company's consolidated financial statements, the parent guarantee is full and unconditional\u201d and, subject to certain exceptions as set forth below, the alternative disclosure required by Rule 13-01 is provided, which includes narrative disclosure and summarized financial information. Accordingly, separate consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership have not been presented. Furthermore, as permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi), the Company has excluded the summarized financial information for the Operating Partnership as the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company and the Operating Partnership are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and not provide incremental value to investors.\nInterest income. Interest income of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $5.1 million when compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This change was primarily driven by a lower interest rate of 0.51% earned during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2.3% during the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as a lower average cash balance as compared to the prior year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nFocus on Our Operational Effectiveness and Cost Structure\nIn connection with the refinancing of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility during the first quarter of 2020 the Company recorded $0.8 million to Loss on debt extinguishment and modifications\u201d in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, representing the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs from the 2018 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. These write-offs were a result of two lenders in the 2018\nWe continuously seek to execute on various initiatives aimed at streamlining our business processes and reducing our cost structure, including: realigning and centralizing key business processes and fully integrating acquired assets and businesses; implementing standardized operational processes; integrating and launching new information technology tools and platforms; instituting key health, safety, leadership and training programs; and capitalizing on the purchasing power of our network. Through the realignment of our business processes, we have acquired new talent and strengthened our service offerings. In order to reduce costs in our facilities, we have invested in energy efficiency projects, including LED lighting, thermal energy storage, motion-sensor technology, variable frequency drives for our fans and compressors, third party efficiency reviews and real-time monitoring of energy consumption, rapid open and close doors, and alternative-power generation technologies to improve the energy efficiency of our warehouses. We have also performed fine-tuning of our refrigeration systems, deployed efficient energy management practices, such as time-of-use and awareness, and have increased our participation in Power Demand Response programs with some of our power suppliers. These initiatives have allowed us to reduce our consumption of kilowatt hours and energy spend.\nBridge loan commitment fees. Corporate-level bridge loan commitment fees were $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2020 and 2019, we obtained a bridge loan to support the Agro and Cloverleaf acquisitions, respectively. The bridge loan facility for Agro and Cloverleaf ultimately did not need to be funded, and accordingly, we expensed the lender commitment and loan fee.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_text": "We are required to distribute 90% of our taxable income (excluding capital gains) on an annual basis in order to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to shareholders from cash flows from our operating activities. While historically we have satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to our shareholders, we may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property. All such distributions are at the discretion of our Board of Trustees. We consider market factors and our performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining distribution levels. We have distributed at least 100% of our taxable income annually since inception to minimize corporate-level federal income taxes. Amounts accumulated for distribution to shareholders are invested primarily in interest-bearing accounts and short-term interest-bearing securities, which are consistent with our intention to maintain our status as a REIT.\n(b)Maintenance capital expenditures include capital expenditures made to extend the life of, and provide future economic benefit from, our existing temperature-controlled warehouse network and its existing supporting personal property and information technology.\n(a)Stub period dividend paid to shareholders of record prior to the IPO.\n(4)Calculated as rent and storage revenue less power and other facilities costs.\nITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSegment Contribution (Net Operating Income or NOI\u201d)\nOur capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from three nationally recognized credit rating agencies. We have investment grade ratings of BBB with a stable outlook from Fitch, BBB with an Under Review with Positive Implications outlook from DBRS Morningstar, and an investment grade rating of Baa3 with a stable outlook from Moody's. These credit ratings are important to our ability to issue debt at favorable rates of interest, among other terms. Refer to our risk factor Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our financing activity\u201d for further details regarding the potential impacts from changes to our credit ratings.\nOn November 19, 2019, we completed the MHW Acquisition for a purchase price of approximately $51.6 million, utilizing available cash on hand. MHW consisted of two temperature-controlled storage facilities, one located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania and another in Perryville, Maryland. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of these facilities within our warehouse segment.\nOn November 2, 2020 the Company completed the acquisition of Hall's. The resulting intangible assets associated with the Hall's acquisition included goodwill of $42.7 million that has been allocated to the warehouse and transportation segments. On December 30, 2020 the Company completed the acquisition of Agro Merchants. The resulting intangible assets associated with the acquisition included goodwill of $346.7 million that has been allocated to the warehouse and transportation segments. The goodwill from Hall's and Agro was excluded from the annual goodwill impairment test, as the test was completed as of October 1, 2020. However, we have not identified any indicators of impairment subsequent to the closing of the aforementioned acquisitions that would necessitate the need for us to perform a quantitative impairment test subsequent to the annual quantitative test performed as of October 1, 2020.\nThe following table shows a comparison of underlying average exchange rates of the foreign currencies that impacted our U.S. dollar-reported revenues and expenses during the periods discussed herein together with a\nThe following table provides certain operating metrics to explain the drivers of our same store performance.\nThe following table presents the operating results of our warehouse segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(2)Included due to our acquisition of Agro on December 30, 2020, no rates are reflected prior to our investment.\nWithdrawal Liability from Multi-employer Plans\nTransportation segment contribution (NOI) was $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $0.7 million, or 4.1%, compared to $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Transportation segment margin increased 75 basis points from the prior year, to 13.2% from 12.5%. On a constant currency basis, transportation segment contribution was $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $0.9 million, or 5.0%, compared to the prior year. The overall increase in margin was primarily due to the strategic shift referenced above, which resulted in more profitable business.\nWe had 135 same stores for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The following table presents revenues, cost of operations, contribution (NOI) and margins for our same stores and non-same stores with a reconciliation to the total financial metrics of our warehouse segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Amounts related to the AM-C, Cloverleaf, Caspers, Hall's, Lanier, MHW, Newport and Nova Cold acquisitions are reflected within non-same store results. The operational results from one day of ownership from the Agro acquisition is not material for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(5)The Company has the option to extend the 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility up to two times for a six-month period each.\n(3)Non-same store warehouse count of 94 includes 46 warehouses acquired through the Agro acquisition on December 30, 2020, eight warehouses acquired through the Hall's acquisition on November 2, 2020, three warehouses acquired through the Casper's and AM-C warehouse acquisitions on August 31, 2020, and five warehouses acquired through the Nova Cold and Newport acquisitions on January 2, 2020. The results of these acquisitions are reflected in the results above since date of ownership. The operational results from one day of ownership of the Agro warehouses is immaterial to the three months and year ended December 31, 2020.\n(3)Calculated as warehouse services revenues less labor and other services costs.\nWe currently expect that our principal sources of funding for working capital, facility acquisitions, business combinations, expansions, maintenance and renovation of our properties, developments projects, debt service and distributions to our shareholders will include:\nOur depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital-intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to our warehouses, including buildings and improvements, refrigeration equipment, racking, leasehold improvements, material handling equipment, furniture and fixtures, and our computer hardware and software. Amortization relates primarily to intangible assets for customer relationships.\nDividends and Distributions\nOther expense - net. Other expense, net was $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $0.7 million was primarily driven by the loss on asset disposal that was offset by a decrease in pension non-service costs.\n\u2022other forms of debt financings and equity offerings.\nmillion, or 0.8%, compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by the exit of certain low-margin international and domestic transportation business, paired with the unfavorable impact from the foreign currency translation of revenues earned by our foreign operations. Domestically, our transportation operations experienced an increase due to the revenue associated with transportation operations from the Hall's acquisition, which closed on November 2, 2020, and resulted in an increase of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, revenue increased from the Cloverleaf Acquisition, which contributed an increase of $2.0 million due to 12 months of results during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to eight months of ownership during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOn May 1, 2019, we completed the Cloverleaf Acquisition for a purchase price of approximately $1.24 billion, utilizing the $1.21 billion net proceeds from our April 2019 follow-on offering and cash drawn from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Cloverleaf was the fifth largest temperature-controlled warehousing provider in the United States, based in Sioux City, Iowa and consisted of 22 facilities in nine states. Cloverleaf also generates income through a small component of transportation operations. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of 21 facilities within our warehouse segment, the results of one facility within our third-party managed segment and the results of Cloverleaf's transportation operations within our transportation segment.\nWe expect that our funding sources as noted above are adequate and will continue to be adequate to meet our short-term liquidity requirements and capital commitments. These liquidity requirements and capital commitments include:\n(b)Declared in March and included in the $30.2 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\nWarehouse. Our primary source of revenues consists of rent, storage and warehouse services fees. Our rent, storage and warehouse services revenues are the key drivers of our financial performance. Rent and storage revenues consist of recurring, periodic charges related to the storage of frozen and perishable food and other products in our warehouses by our customers. We also provide these customers with a wide array of handling and other warehouse services, such as (1) receipt, handling and placement of products into our warehouses for storage and preservation, (2) retrieval of products from storage upon customer request, (3) blast freezing, which involves the rapid freezing of non-frozen products, including individual quick freezing for agricultural produce and seafood, (4) case-picking, which involves selecting product cases to build customized pallets, (5) kitting and repackaging, which involves assembling custom product packages for delivery to retailers and consumers, and labeling services, (6) order assembly and load consolidation, (7) exporting and importing support services, (8) container handling, (9) cross-docking, which involves transferring inbound products to outbound trucks utilizing our warehouse docks without storing them in our warehouses, (10) government-approved temperature-controlled storage and inspection services, (11) fumigation, (12) pre-cooling and cold treatment services, and (13) ripening. We refer to these handling and other warehouse services as our value-added services.\n\u2022current cash balances;\nThere were $21.7 million letters of credit issued on the Company's 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nThe Series A, B, C, D, and E senior notes (collectively referred to as the Senior Unsecured Notes\u201d) and guarantee agreement includes a prepayment option executable at any time during the term of the loans. The prepayment can be either a partial payment or payment in full, as long as the partial payment is at least 5% of the outstanding principal. Any prepayment in full must include a make-whole amount, which is the discounted remaining scheduled payments due to the lender. The discount rate to be used is equal to 0.50% plus the yield to maturity reported for the most recently actively traded U.S. Treasury Securities with a maturity equal to the remaining average life of the prepaid principal. The Company must give each lender at least 10 days written notice whenever it intends to prepay any portion of the debt.\n We calculate funds from operations, or FFO, in accordance with the standards established by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding extraordinary items as defined under U.S. GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, real estate asset impairment and our share of reconciling items for partially owned entities. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it excludes the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs, which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. We calculate core funds from operations, or Core FFO, as FFO adjusted for the effects of gain or loss on the sale of non-real estate assets, non-real estate impairment, acquisition, litigation and other, share-based compensation expense for the IPO retention grants, bridge loan commitment fees, loss on debt extinguishment, modifications and termination of derivative instruments, foreign currency exchange loss and gain from sale of partially owned entities. We also adjust for the impact of Core FFO attributable to partially owned entities. We have elected to reflect our share of Core FFO attributable to partially owned entities since the Brazil JV is a strategic partnership which we continue to actively participate in on an ongoing basis. The previous joint venture, the China JV, was considered for disposition during the periods presented. We believe that Core FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it excludes the effects of certain items which can create significant earnings volatility, but which do not directly relate to our core business operations. We believe Core FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods, while also providing a more meaningful predictor of future earnings potential. However, because FFO and Core FFO add back real estate depreciation and amortization and do not capture the level of maintenance capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, both of which have material economic impacts on our results from operations, we believe the utility of FFO and Core FFO as a measure of our performance may be limited. We calculate adjusted funds from operations, or Adjusted FFO, as Core FFO adjusted for the effects of amortization of deferred financing costs, pension withdrawal liability and above or below market leases, straight-line net rent, provision or benefit from deferred income taxes, share-based compensation expense from grants of stock options and restricted stock units under our equity incentive plans, excluding IPO grants, non-real estate depreciation and amortization, and maintenance capital expenditures. We also adjust for AFFO attributable to our share of reconciling items of partially owned entities. We believe that Adjusted FFO is helpful to investors as a meaningful supplemental comparative performance measure of our ability to make incremental capital investments in our business and to assess our ability to fund distribution requirements from our operating activities. FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO should be evaluated along with U.S. GAAP net income and net income per diluted share (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures) in evaluating our operating performance. FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO do not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are not indicative of our results of operations or cash flows from operating activities as disclosed in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO should be considered as supplements, but not alternatives, to our net income or cash flows from operating activities as indicators of our operating performance. Moreover, other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or may interpret the NAREIT definition differently than we do. Accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to FFO as calculated by other REITs. In addition, there is no industry definition of Core FFO or Adjusted FFO and, as a result, other REITs may also calculate Core FFO or Adjusted FFO, or other similarly-captioned metrics, in a manner different than we do. The table below reconciles FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \nIn the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans, we could agree to discontinue participation in one or more plans, and in that event we could face a withdrawal liability. Additionally, we could be treated as withdrawing from a plan if the number of our associates participating in the plan is reduced to a certain degree over certain periods of time.\nEconomic Occupancy of our Warehouses\n\u2022these measures do not reflect our historical or future cash requirements for maintenance capital expenditures or growth and expansion capital expenditures;\nOther Consolidated Operating Expenses\nThere were $23.0 million letters of credit issued on the Company's 2018 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2019. During the first quarter of 2020, the 2018 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility was refinanced and no longer outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nOther Consolidated Operating Expenses. We also incur depreciation and amortization expenses, corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses and corporate-level acquisition, litigation and other expenses.\ninfluenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels and achievement of incentive compensation targets. To position ourselves to meet the challenges of the current business environment, we have implemented a shared services support structure to better manage costs and enhance the efficiency of our operations.\nForeign currency exchange (loss) gain, net. We reported a foreign currency exchange loss of $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a nominal gain for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company entered into an undesignated foreign currency forward contract to lock in the conversion of the expected proceeds of the \u20ac750 million denominated debt issuance to USD, which settled on December 30, 2020, and resulted in $45.0 million in foreign currency exchange loss when compared to the USD equivalent of the Euro denominated debt at market rates, on the date of issuance.\nWe utilize a strategic approach to recurring maintenance capital expenditures and repair and maintenance expenses to maintain the high quality and operational efficiency of our warehouses and ensure that our warehouses meet the mission-critical\u201d role they serve in the cold chain.\n(4)Calculated as rent and storage contribution (NOI) divided by rent and storage revenue.\nThird-party managed revenue was $291.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $38.8 million, or 15.3%, compared to $252.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, third-party managed revenue was $292.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $39.1 million, or 15.5%, compared to the prior year. This increase was a result of higher business volume in our domestic and Australia managed operations due to the consumer demand shift to retail. This increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation related to our Canadian and Australian managed revenues, and the impacts from the exit of two Canadian managed facilities during 2020 and the exit of one domestic managed facility during the third quarter of 2019.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n(2)Calculated as rent and storage revenues less power and other facilities costs.\nThe following table presents revenues, cost of operations, contribution (NOI) and margins for our same stores and non-same stores with a reconciliation to the total financial metrics of our warehouse segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nComparison of Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nBusiness Combinations\nWarehouse segment cost of operations was $1.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $99.4 million, or 10.7%, compared to $929.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, our warehouse segment cost of operations was $1.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $103.4 million, or 11.1%, compared to the prior year. Approximately $97.8 million of the increase, on an actual basis,was primarily driven by the additional facilities we acquired in connection with the aforementioned acquisitions. In addition, we incurred increases in our cost of operations in response to COVID-19. We undertook initiatives to ensure the health and safety of our associates, incurring higher costs for items such as labor, due to social distancing requirements, cleaning and sanitation supplies, and other personal protective equipment ( PPE\u201d). These incremental COVID-19 expenses include higher sanitation costs of $3.2 million and higher PPE costs of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, we experienced higher property taxes and property insurance expense during 2020, due primarily to our growing portfolio. During the second quarter of 2020, we also paid a front-line appreciation bonus to our associates in recognition of their dedication and efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic, which totaled $4.3 million. The foreign currency translation of expenses incurred by our foreign operations had a $4.0 million favorable impact during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.\n\u2022these measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n(c)Declared in June and included in the $38.8 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\n(1)We define average economic occupancy as the aggregate number of physically occupied pallets and any additional pallets otherwise contractually committed for a given period, without duplication. We estimate the number of contractually committed pallet positions by taking into account actual pallet commitment specified in each customers' contract, and subtracting the physical pallet positions.\nEconomic occupancy at our same stores was 80.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 110 basis points compared to 79.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This change was primarily the result of an increase in fixed storage contracts. Our economic occupancy at our same stores for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 781 basis points higher than our corresponding average physical occupancy of 72.7%. The decrease of 265 basis points in average physical occupancy compared to 75.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 was partially driven by lower protein occupancy and lower food service business occupancy due to stay-at-home\u201d orders as well as port congestion as a result of COVID-19, which generated lower throughput of inventory within our warehouses. This was partially offset by the increase in physical occupancy related to the retail products as a result of higher grocery demand related to COVID-19.\n\n\u2022a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of greater than or equal to 1.50x; and\nFuture Sources and Uses of Cash\n(1)The adjustments from our U.S. GAAP operating results to calculate our operating results on a constant currency basis are the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the comparable prior period.\nIn addition to our segment contribution (NOI) and segment contribution (NOI) margin, we analyze the contribution (NOI) of our warehouse rent and storage operations and our warehouse services operations within our warehouse segment. We calculate the contribution (NOI) of our warehouse rent and storage operations as rent and storage revenues less power and other facilities cost. We calculate the contribution (NOI) of our warehouse services operations as warehouse services revenues less labor and other service costs. We calculate the contribution (NOI) margin for each of these operations as the applicable contribution (NOI) measure divided by the applicable revenue measure. We believe the presentation of these contribution (NOI) and contribution (NOI) margin measures helps investors understand the relative revenues, costs and earnings resulting from each of these separate types of services we provide to our customers in the same manner reviewed by our management in connection with the operation of our business. These contribution (NOI) measures within our warehouse segment are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and these measures should be considered as supplements, but not as alternatives, to our results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We provide reconciliations of these measures in the discussions of our comparative results of operations below.\n(9)The effective interest rate includes effects of amortization of the deferred financing costs. The weighted average effective interest rate for total debt was 3.19% and 4.57% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe are the world's largest publicly traded REIT focused on the ownership, operation, acquisition and development of temperature-controlled warehouses. We are organized as a self-administered and self-managed REIT with proven operating, development and acquisition expertise. As of December 31, 2020, we operated a global network of 238 temperature-controlled warehouses encompassing over 1.4 billion cubic feet, with 194 warehouses in North America, 26 in Europe, 15 warehouses in Asia-Pacific, and 3 warehouses in South America. We view and manage our business through three primary business segments: warehouse, third-party managed and transportation. In addition, we hold two minority interests in Brazilian-based joint ventures, one with SuperFrio, which owns or operates 22 temperature-controlled warehouses and one with Comfrio, which owns or operates 13 temperature-controlled warehouses.\nrates. These assumptions are based on risk-adjusted growth rates and discount factors accommodating conservative viewpoints that consider the full range of variability contemplated in the current and potential future economic situations. The discount rates utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on the respective reporting units weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels. We also assess market-based multiples of other market-participant companies, further corroborating that our discounted cash flow models reflect fair value assumptions that are appropriately aligned with market-participant valuation multiples.\nThe following table presents the operating results of our third-party managed segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\u2022our outstanding equity forward sale agreements;\n\u2022Litigation costs incurred in order to defend ourselves from litigation charges outside of the normal course of business and related settlement costs.\nStrategic Shift within Our Transportation Segment\nWe use the following non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental performance measures of our business: FFO, Core FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDAre and Core EBITDA.\nMaterial Acquisition in our 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is defined as one in which assets acquired exceeds an amount equal to 5% of total asset value as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter publicly available. Obligations under our 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility are general unsecured obligations of our Operating Partnership and are guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe PortFresh acquisition cost included approximately $15.9 million allocated to land on which we have developed a new facility, and have classified within Expansion and development expenditures in order to reflect the total cost of the project. The Cloverleaf acquisition included approximately $17.0 million allocated to assets under construction which we have classified within Expansion and development expenditures in order to reflect the total cost of the projects discussed further below. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the purchase price allocation for each acquisition.\n\u2022a maximum unsecured indebtedness to qualified assets ratio of less than 0.60 to 1.00;\n\u2022capital expenditures;\nWe calculate same store contribution (NOI)\u201d as revenues for the same store population less its cost of operations (excluding any depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses, corporate-level acquisition, litigation and other expenses and gain or loss on sale of real estate). In order to derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we also calculate our same store contribution (NOI) on a constant currency basis to remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the comparable prior period exchange rate to translate from local currency into U.S. dollars for both periods. We evaluate the performance of the warehouses we own or lease using a same store\u201d analysis, and we believe that same store contribution (NOI) is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it includes the operating performance from the population of properties that is consistent from period to period and also on a constant currency basis, thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of our warehouse portfolio and currency fluctuations on performance measures.\nFacility due to the decrease in the LIBOR rate. This was offset by the increase in the Senior Unsecured Term Loan A which was expanded to fund the Nova Cold acquisition and the private placement of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of Series C Senior Unsecured Notes on May 7, 2019, which were used to fund a portion of the Cloverleaf and Lanier acquisitions. While our average outstanding principal has increased from the comparable prior period, on average, the effective interest rate of our outstanding debt has decreased from 4.79% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 3.94% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs part of our initiatives to streamline our business processes and to reduce our cost structure, we have evaluated and exited less strategic and profitable markets or business lines, including the sale of certain warehouse assets, the exit of certain leased facilities, the exit of certain managed warehouse agreements, the sale of our quarry business and the exit of the China JV (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this\nOn November 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Halls for total consideration of $489.2 million. On December 30, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Agro Merchants for total consideration of $1.59 billion. The acquisition accounting for both of these business combinations is based upon a preliminary valuation. Our estimates and assumptions are subject to change during the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the acquisition date. The primary areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the following: finalizing the review and valuation of land, land improvements, building and machinery and equipment (including the models, key assumptions, estimates and inputs) and assignment of remaining useful lives associated with the depreciable assets), (ii) finalizing the review and valuation of customer related intangible assets (including key assumptions, inputs and estimates), (iii) finalizing our review of certain current and non-current assets acquired and liabilities assumed, (iv) finalizing the valuation of certain in-place contracts or contractual relationships (including but not limited to leases), including determining the appropriate amortization period, (v) finalizing the evaluation and valuation of certain legal matters and/or other loss contingencies, including those that we may not yet be aware of but meet the requirement to qualify as a pre-acquisition contingency, and (vi) finalizing our estimate of the impact of purchase accounting on deferred income tax liabilities.\nInvesting Activities\nAs a result of this distribution requirement, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies which are not REITs can. We may need to continue to raise capital in the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, as well as potential developments in new or existing properties, acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures. In addition, we may be required to use borrowings under our revolving credit facility, if necessary, to meet REIT distribution requirements and maintain our REIT status.\n(a)(Gain) loss on sale of real estate, net of withholding tax include withholding tax on the sale of Sydney land which is included in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we participated in seven multiemployer pension plans administered by labor unions representing approximately 13% of our associates. We make periodic contributions to these plans pursuant to the terms of our collective bargaining agreements to allow the plans to meet their pension benefit obligations.\nConstant Currency Metrics\n\n2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility\nOn May 1, 2013, we entered into a mortgage financing in an aggregate principal amount of $322.0 million, which we refer to as the 2013 Mortgage Loans. The debt consists of a senior debt note and two mezzanine notes. The components are cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted. The senior debt note requires monthly principal payments. The mezzanine notes require no principal payments until the stated maturity date in May 2023. The interest rates on the notes are fixed and range from 3.81% to 11.50% per annum. The senior debt note and the two mezzanine notes remain subject to yield maintenance provisions. We used the net proceeds of these loans to refinance certain of the 2006 Mortgage Loans, acquire two warehouses, and fund general corporate purposes.\n\u2022Non-recurring public company implementation costs associated with the implementation of financial reporting systems and processes needed to convert the organization to a public reporting company.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.40 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 and primarily consisted of $1.21 billion net proceeds from the April 2019 follow-on offering, $350.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of our Series C senior unsecured notes in May 2019, $100.0 million in proceeds received from revolving line of credit and $10.2 million in proceeds from stock options exercised. These cash inflows were partially offset by $135.4 million of distributions paid, $100.0 million of repayment to revolving line of credit, $16.5 million of repayments on lease obligations, $10.4 million of repayment of mortgage notes and notes payable, $7.1 million paid for tax withholdings remitted to authorities related to stock options exercised and $2.1 million paid related to debt issuance costs.\nOn April 26, 2019, we completed a debt private placement transaction consisting of $350.0 million senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 4.10% due January 8, 2030 ( Series C\u201d). The transaction closed on May 7, 2019. Interest is paid on January 8 and July 8 of each year until maturity, with the first payment occurring January\n(d)Declared in September and included in the $43.3 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\n2018 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility\n(1)Represents the relevant average foreign exchange rates in effect in the comparable prior period applied to the activity for the current period. The average foreign currency exchange rates we apply to our operating results are derived from third party reporting sources for the periods indicated.\n\u2022cash flows from operations;\nMaintenance Capital Expenditures\nIf a change in control occurs for us, we must issue an offer to prepay the remaining portion of the debt to the lenders. The prepayment amount will be 100% of the principal amount, as well as accrued and unpaid interest.\nIn connection with the early repayment of a portion of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility during the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recorded $1.5 million to Loss on debt extinguishment and modifications\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, representing the write-off of the proportionate unamortized deferred financing costs from the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. In addition, the Company terminated the two interest rate swaps related to the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility for a fee of $16.4 million. Approximately $8.7 million of this fee will remain in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\u201d and will be amortized to expense through 2024, while $7.7 million was expensed to Loss on debt extinguishment, modifications, and termination of derivative instruments\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nResults of Operations\n (1) Net debt to Core EBITDA represents (i) our gross debt (defined as total debt plus discount and deferred financing costs) less cash and cash equivalents divided by (ii) Core EBITDA. Core EBITDA for 2020 and 2019 for purposes of this calculation assumes ownership of our acquisitions for the full twelve months of the year. Our management believes that this ratio is useful because it provides investors with information regarding gross debt less cash and cash equivalents, which could be used to repay debt, compared to our performance as measured using Core EBITDA. The following table reconciles net debt to total debt, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP: \nThe following table shows the number of same-store warehouses in our portfolio and the number of warehouses excluded as same-store warehouses for the year ended December 31, 2020. While not included in the non-same store warehouse count in the table below, the results of operations for the non-same store warehouses includes the partial period impact of the sites that were exited during the year ended December 31, 2020, as described in footnote 2 following the table. In addition, we hold two minority interests in Brazilian-based joint ventures, one with SuperFrio, which owns or operates 22 temperature-controlled warehouses and one with Comfrio, which owns or operates 13 temperature-controlled warehouses; these joint ventures are not included in the table below.\nSame store contribution (NOI) is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies providing temperature-controlled warehouse storage and handling and other warehouse services may not define same store or calculate same store contribution (NOI) in a manner consistent with our definition or calculation. Same store contribution (NOI) should be considered as a supplement, but not as an alternative, to our results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We provide reconciliations of these measures in the discussions of our comparative results of operations below.\nAs discussed above under Key Factors Affecting Our Business and Financial Results-Foreign Currency Translation Impact on Our Operations,\u201d our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations outside our control that are caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues generated and expenses incurred by our operations outside the United States. As a result, in order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we analyze our business performance based on certain constant currency reporting that represents current period results translated into U.S. dollars at the relevant average foreign exchange rates applicable in the comparable prior period. We believe that the presentation of constant currency results provides a measurement of our ongoing operations that is meaningful to investors because it excludes the impact of these foreign currency movements that we cannot control. Constant currency results are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and our constant currency results should be considered as a supplement, but not as an alternative, to our results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The constant currency performance measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We provide reconciliations of these measures in the discussions of our comparative results of operations below. Our discussion of the drivers of our performance below are based upon U.S. GAAP.\nOther Expense\nThe 2013 Mortgage Loans also require compliance with other financial covenants, including a debt coverage ratio and cash flow calculation, as defined.\n(2)We define average physical occupancy as the average number of occupied pallets divided by the estimated number of average physical pallet positions in our warehouses for the applicable period. We estimate the number of physical pallet positions by taking into account actual racked space and by estimating unracked space on an as-if racked basis. We base this estimate on a formula utilizing the total cubic feet of each room within the warehouse that is unracked divided by the volume of an assumed rack space that is\nOur transportation segment continued its strategic shift to focus on more profitable solutions, which create value for our customers while driving and supporting our warehouse business including consolidation offerings. Transportation revenue was $142.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 1.8%, compared to $144.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, transportation revenue was $143.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1.1\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the China JV). Through our process of active portfolio management, we continue to evaluate our markets and offerings.\n\n(2)Includes real estate rent expense of $12.9 million and $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSelling, general and administrative. Corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses were $144.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $15.4 million, or 11.9%, compared to $129.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Included in these amounts are business development expenses attributable to new business pursuits, supply chain solutions and underwriting, facility development, customer onboarding, and engineering and consulting services to support our customers in the cold chain. Business development expenses represented approximately 13% and 14% of corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe these costs are comparable to leasing costs for other publicly-traded REITs. The increase in corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher share-based compensation and higher payroll and benefits related to additional investments to support our expanded development pipeline and higher professional fees. This was offset by a reduction in travel expense due to stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, paired with net synergies realized from acquisitions. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.3% and 7.2%, respectively, of total revenues.\nservices to its customers. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of the facilities within our warehouse segment, and the results of Halls transportation services within our transportation segment.\nTransportation Segment\nThe following table presents the operating results of our transportation segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nOn December 30, 2020 we completed a debt private placement transaction consisting of (i) \u20ac400.00 million senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 1.62% due January 7, 2031 ( Series D\u201d) and (ii) \u20ac350.00 million senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 1.65% due January 7, 2033 ( Series E\u201d). Interest is payable on January 7 and July 7 of each year until maturity, with the first payment occurring July 7, 2021. The notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Operating Partnership and are guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company. In connection with entering into the agreement, we incurred approximately $4.5 million of debt issuance costs related to the issuance, which we amortize as interest expense under the effective interest method. The proceeds of the Series D and Series E issuance were used to fund a portion of the Agro acquisition, provide long-term financing for the Halls acquisition and repay a portion of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan Tranche A-1.\n(6)The 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan Tranche A-2 is denominated in Canadian dollars and aggregates to CAD $250.0 million. The carrying value in the table above is the US dollar equivalent as of December 31, 2020.\nWe are a well-known seasoned issuer with an effective shelf registration statement filed on April 16, 2020, which registered an indeterminate amount of common shares, preferred shares, depositary shares and warrants, as well as debt securities of the Operating Partnership, which will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us. As circumstances warrant, we may issue equity securities from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. We may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, the funding of development, expansion and acquisition opportunities and to increase working capital.\n(1)The adjustments from our U.S. GAAP operating results to calculate our operating results on a constant currency basis is the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the comparable prior period.\n We use EBITDAre and Core EBITDA as measures of our operating performance and not as measures of liquidity. The table below reconciles EBITDAre and Core EBITDA to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \n(8)The Senior Unsecured Notes Series E is denominated in Euros and aggregates to Euro $350.0 million. The carrying value in the table above is the US dollar equivalent as of December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Terminated site operations costs represent expenses incurred to return leased sites to their original physical state at lease inception in connection with the termination of the applicable underlying lease. These terminations were part of our strategic efforts to exit or sell non-strategic warehouses as opposed to ordinary course lease expirations. Repair and maintenance expenses associated with our ordinary course operations are reflected as operating expenses on our consolidated statement of operations.\nOn August 31, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Caspers Cold Storage for cash consideration of approximately $25.6 million, utilizing available cash on hand. Caspers consisted of a single temperature-controlled warehouse located in Tampa, Florida. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of this facility within our warehouse segment.\nPresentation\nIn the event that we withdraw from participation in any of the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate, the documents governing the applicable plan and applicable law could require us to make an additional contribution to the applicable plan in the amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to our participation in the plan, and we would have to reflect that as an expense on our Consolidated Statement of Operations and as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer pension plan would depend on the extent of the plan's funding of vested benefits as of the year in which the withdrawal occurs, and may vary depending on the funded status of the applicable multiemployer pension plan, whether there is a mass withdrawal of all participating employers and whether any other participating employer in the applicable plan withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan. The present value of all benefits vested under each of the multiemployer plans that we participated in as of December 31, 2020 (based on the labor union's assumptions used to fund such plan) did not, as of the last annual valuation date applicable thereto, exceed the value of the assets of such plan allocable to such vested benefits. Based on the latest information available from plan administrators, we estimate our share of the aggregate withdrawal liability for the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate could have been as much as $726.9 million as of December 31, 2020, of which we estimate that certain of our customers are contractually obligated to make indemnification payments to us for approximately $699.7 million. However, there is no guarantee that, to the extent we incurred any such withdrawal liability, we would be successful in obtaining any indemnification payments therefore.\ncommon shares on behalf of our previously significant shareholders in March 2019, for which we received no proceeds.\nRepair and Maintenance Expenses\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding our expectation for future performance, liquidity and capital resources, that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include those identified below and those described under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed on March 2, 2020, for a discussion of the comparative results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nWe define average economic occupancy as the aggregate number of physically occupied pallets and any additional pallets otherwise contractually committed for a given period, without duplication. We estimate the number of contractually committed pallet positions by taking into account the actual pallet commitment specified in each customers' contract, and subtracting the physical pallet positions. We regard economic occupancy as an important driver of our financial results. Historically, providers of temperature-controlled warehouse space have offered storage services to customers on an as-utilized, on-demand basis. We actively seek to enter into contracts that implement our commercial business rules which contemplate, among other things, fixed storage commitments in connection with establishing new customer relationships. Additionally, we actively seek opportunities to transition our current customers to contracts that feature a fixed storage commitment when renewing existing agreements or upon the change in the anticipated profile of our customer. This strategy mitigates the impact of changes in physical occupancy throughout the course of the year due to seasonality, as well as other factors that can impact physical occupancy while ensuring our customers have the necessary space they need to support their business.\n\u2022these measures do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; and\n(1)The adjustments from our U.S. GAAP operating results to calculate our operating results on a constant currency basis are the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the comparable prior period.\nAcquisition, litigation and other. Corporate-level acquisition, litigation and other expenses were $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $4.3 million compared to $40.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Included in these amounts are business acquisition related costs, litigation costs associated with litigation charges outside of the normal course of business or resulting from a settlement, severance and equity acceleration costs incurred in connection with former executives, severance as a result of synergies realized from acquisitions or operational realignment, non-offering related equity issuance expenses, and terminated site operations costs. We view all of these costs as corporate in nature regardless of the segment or segments involved in certain transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $26.5 million of acquisition related expenses primarily composed of professional fees and integration related costs in connection with completed and potential acquisitions, primarily related to the recently completed Agro Merchants Acquisition, and employee retention. Additionally, we incurred $1.1 million of severance primarily related to reduction in headcount as a result of the synergies from acquisitions, and partially related to the realignment of our international operations. During the fourth quarter of 2020 we were subject to a cybersecurity incident and incurred $7.9 million of costs related to it. The cyber incident costs include third-party fees incurred in connection with the cyber incident that occurred in November 2020, as well as any incremental costs, internal and external, incurred to restore operations at our facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $24.3 million of acquisition related expenses primarily composed of professional fees and integration related costs in connection with completed and potential acquisitions, primarily related to the Cloverleaf Acquisition, and employee retention. In addition, we incurred $4.3 million of severance and equity acceleration expenses related to exited former executives and the resignation of a member of the Board of Trustees and $5.4 million of severance related to reduction in headcount as a result of the synergies created from the Cloverleaf and Lanier acquisitions and organizational realignment of our international operations. We also incurred $4.6 million of legal settlement and related litigation professional fees and $1.4 million of costs in connection with the secondary offering of\nThe 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility is broken into two tranches. Tranche A-1 is comprised of a $425.0 million USD term loan and Tranche A-2 is comprised of a CAD $250.0 million term loan, both are five-year loans maturing in 2025. Tranche A-2 provides a natural hedge for the Company's investment in the recently completed Nova Cold acquisition. We refer to Tranches A-1 and A-2 in aggregate as the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan Facility. In connection with entering into the agreement, we incurred approximately $3.2 million of debt issuance costs related to the term loan, which we amortize as interest expense under the effective interest method. As of December 31, 2020, $5.6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility are included in Mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and term loan\u201d in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDebt Covenants\nThird-party managed segment contribution (NOI) was $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $0.5 million, or 4.0%, compared to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, third-party managed segment contribution (NOI) was $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $0.4 million, or 3.8%, compared to the prior year. The increase in segment contribution was a result of the factors mentioned above.\n2013 Mortgage Loans\nIn May 2020, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC release No. 33-10786, Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses, amending Rule 1-02(w)(2) which includes amendments to certain of its rules and forms related to the disclosure of financial information regarding acquired or disposed businesses. Among other changes, the amendments impact SEC rules relating to (1) the definition of significant\u201d subsidiaries, (2) requirements to provide financial statements for significant\u201d acquisitions, and (3) revisions to the formulation and usage of pro forma financial information. The final rule is effective on January 1, 2021; however, voluntary early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted the provisions of the final rule in the third quarter of 2020. We have applied the new rules to the contemplated and completed acquisitions since the date of adoption. The Agro acquisition met the SEC's revised definition of significance, requiring one year of audited financial statements and pro forma financial information and was filed on Form 8-K/A on February 26, 2021.\nGain from sale of partially owned entities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold our interest in the China JV which resulted in the $4.3 million gain.\n\n\u2022a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio of less than or equal to 60% to unencumbered asset value.

Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators and competition. As of October 1, 2020, our reporting units included the following: North American warehouse, U.S. transportation, North America third-party managed, international warehouse, international third-party managed, and international transportation. Our reporting units may change with the integration of Agro's operations in Europe, North America, South America, and Australia. However, since the Agro acquisition closed on December 30, 2020, it was not included in the 2020 annual goodwill impairment evaluation.\nSenior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility that did not participate in the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility, accordingly those lenders' portion of unamortized deferred financing costs were written off. Similarly, two lenders in the 2018 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility did not participate in the 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, and those lender's portions of unamortized deferred financing costs were written off.\nSame Store Analysis\nThe following table presents our outstanding and available indebtedness as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(1) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired and adjustments does not include $512 million of equity issued directly to Oaktree Capital, the former owners of Agro, as consideration for the Agro acquisition.\nWe may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise, we perform a quantitative impairment test. We may also perform a quantitative evaluation periodically, even if there is no change of events or circumstances.\n\n\u2022Severance costs representing certain contractual and negotiated severance and separation costs from exited former executives, reduction in headcount due to synergies achieved through acquisitions or operational efficiencies, and reduction in workforce costs associated with exiting or selling non-strategic warehouses.\n\nWarehouse segment revenue was $1.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $172.1 million, or 12.5%, compared to $1.38 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, our warehouse segment revenue was $1.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $177.7 million, or 12.9%, compared to the prior year. Approximately $158.7 million of the increase, on an actual basis, was primarily driven by acquisitions completed during 2019 and 2020, including the growth experienced period-over-period during overlapping periods of ownership. We acquired 23 warehouse facilities as a result of the Cloverleaf and Lanier acquisitions on May 1, 2019, two facilities in connection with the MHW acquisition on November 19, 2019 and one facility as a result of the PortFresh acquisition on February 1, 2019, and therefore did not have ownership of these facilities during the entirety of the comparable prior period. In 2020, we acquired 62 facilities in the warehouse segment in the Agro, AM-C, Caspers, Halls, Newport and Nova Cold acquisitions. Agro's revenue is not reflected in the operating results of our warehouse segment as the\nWarehouse segment contribution (NOI) was $520.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $72.7 million, or 16.3%, compared to $447.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, warehouse segment contribution was $521.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $74.3 million, or 16.6%, compared to the prior year. The foreign currency translation of our results of operations had a $1.6 million unfavorable impact to the warehouse segment contribution period-over-period. The increase was primarily driven by the additional facilities in the warehouse segment as a result of the aforementioned acquisitions, including the growth and synergies experienced period-over-period during overlapping periods of ownership. The remainder of the increase was driven by improvements in our core business, same store economic occupancy growth, and disciplined cost controls through the Americold Operating System of our power and other services costs, which allowed us to generate higher contribution margins. The increases were partially offset by the currency translation impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the appreciation bonus paid to front-line associates to recognize the efforts of our associates during the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in the cost of property taxes and property insurance, as well as the increase in costs related to the COVID-19 response efforts to maintain the health and safety of our associates.\nTransportation cost of operations was $123.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $3.4 million, or 2.7%, compared to $126.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, transportation cost of operations was $124.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 1.6%, compared to the prior year. Domestically, our transportation cost of operations experienced an increase due to the cost associated with transportation operations from the Hall's acquisition, which closed on November 2, 2020, and resulted in an increase of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, cost of operations increased from the Cloverleaf Acquisition, which contributed an increase of $1.2 million due to 12 months of results during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to eight months of ownership during the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding the increases in transportation cost of operations resulting from the aforementioned acquisitions, the strategic shift referenced above, paired with the impact of the foreign currency translation of our international costs, led to a decline in transportation cost of operations for the segment.\n(1)L = one-month LIBOR\nHistorically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the value of goodwill. The results of our 2020 impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of the corresponding carrying amount as of October 1, and no impairment of goodwill existed.\nFinancing Activities\nThe level and nature of throughput at our warehouses is an important factor impacting our warehouse services revenues in our warehouse segment. Throughput refers to the volume of pallets that enter and exit our warehouses. Higher levels of throughput drive warehouse services revenues in our warehouse segment as customers are typically billed on a basis that takes into account the level of throughput of the goods they store in our warehouses. The nature of throughput may be driven by the expected turn of the underlying product or commodity. Throughput pallets can be influenced both by the food manufacturers as well as shifts in demand preferences. Food manufacturers' production levels, which respond to market conditions and consumer preferences, may impact inbound pallets. Similarly, a change in inventory turnover due to shift in customer demand may impact outbound pallets.\n\n\u2022quarterly shareholder distributions.\nAlso, on May 1, 2019, we completed the Lanier Acquisition for approximately $82.5 million utilizing cash drawn from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Lanier consisted of two temperature-controlled storage facilities in Georgia serving the poultry industry. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of these facilities within our warehouse segment.\n(6)Calculated as warehouse rent and storage contribution (NOI) divided by warehouse rent and storage revenue.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nGoodwill Impairment Evaluation\n\nTransportation. We charge transportation fees, including fuel surcharges, to our customers for whom we arrange the transportation of their products. Cost of operations for our transportation segment consists primarily of third-party carrier charges, which are impacted by factors affecting those carriers. Additionally, in connection with the Cloverleaf Acquisition, we acquired trucks and associates that support certain customers within the geographic area. We supplemented our regional, national and truckload consolidation business with the Hall's acquisition, which services the Northeast corridor of the U.S. with an owned and maintained fleet. Our acquisition of Agro Merchants further expands our Transportation service offering. Agro Merchants operates its own fleet of temperature-controlled vehicles in the U.S., Ireland and UK and also offers a variety of non-asset based transportation management services. These include multi-modal global freight forwarding services to support our customers' needs.\nLoss from partially owned entities. We reported a loss of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a loss of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into the Brazil JV for which we recorded our portion of loss generated by SuperFrio. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the loss related to the China JV, which we exited during the third quarter of 2019.\n\u2022a maximum leverage ratio of less than or equal to 60% of our total asset value. Following a material acquisition, leverage ratio shall not exceed 65%;\nExpansion and development initiatives also include $20.0 million of corporate initiatives, which are projects designed to reduce future spending over the course of time. This category reflects return on investment projects, conversion of leases to owned assets, and other cost-saving initiatives.\n\u2022operating activities and overall working capital;\ncomparison against the exchange rates of such currencies at the end of the applicable periods presented herein. The rates below represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of one unit of the respective foreign currency. Amounts presented in constant currency within our results of operations are calculated by applying the average foreign exchange rate from the comparable prior year period to actual local currency results in the current period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective period. While constant currency metrics are a non-GAAP calculation and do not represent actual results, the comparison allows the reader to understand the impact of the underlying operations in addition to the impact of changing foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe Senior Unsecured Notes require compliance with leverage ratios, secured and unsecured indebtedness ratios, and unsecured indebtedness to qualified assets ratios. In addition, we are required to maintain at all times a credit rating for each series of notes from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The 2018 Senior Unsecured Notes agreement includes the following financial covenants:\n(6)Non-same store warehouse count of 94 includes 46 warehouses acquired through the Agro acquisition on December 30, 2020, eight warehouses acquired through the Hall's acquisition on November 2, 2020, three warehouses acquired through the Casper's and AM-C warehouse acquisitions on August 31, 2020, and five warehouses acquired through the Nova Cold and Newport acquisitions on January 2, 2020. The results of these acquisitions are reflected in the results above since date of ownership. The operational results from one day of ownership of the Agro warehouses is immaterial to the three months and year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe acquisition method of accounting also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record future impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense.\nOn September 24, 2019, we reduced our interest rate margins from 1.45% to 1.00% and decreased the fee on unused borrowing capacity by 5 basis points for usage greater than 50% of the total commitment and 15 basis points for usage less than 50% of commitment. The fee for unused borrowing capacity was 20 basis points regardless of the percentage of total commitment used. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company received a favorable credit rating. This rating, when combined with existing ratings, allowed the Company to transition to a favorable ratings-based pricing grid during the third quarter of 2019.\n(2)C=one month CDOR\nOn February 1, 2019, we completed the PortFresh Acquisition for a purchase price of approximately $35.9 million, utilizing available cash on hand. PortFresh consisted of one facility operating near the port of Savannah, Georgia and adjacent land upon which we have constructed a newly developed facility. This newly constructed facility received its certificate of occupancy during the second quarter of 2020. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of the acquired facility within our Warehouse segment.\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated will often have to be replaced in the future and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\n\u2022these measures do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness;\nRevenue Recognition\nOur bad debt expense was $1.6 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we maintained bad debt allowances of approximately $12.3 million, which we believed to be adequate.\nOur primary revenue source consists of rent, storage and warehouse services revenues. Additionally, we charge transportation fees to those customers who use our transportation services, where we act as the principal in the arrangement of the services. We also receive a reimbursement of substantially all expenses for warehouses that we manage on behalf of third-party owners, with all reimbursements recognized as revenues under the relevant accounting guidance. We also earn management fees, incentive fees upon achieving negotiated performance and cost-savings results, or an applicable mark-up on costs. Revenues from storage and handling are recognized over the period consistent with the transfer of the service to the customer. Multiple contracts with a single counterparty are accounted for as separate arrangements. We recognize transportation fees and expenses on a gross basis upon delivery of products on behalf of our customers. We also recognize management fees and related expense reimbursements as revenues as we perform management services and incur the expense.\nOn March 26, 2020, we entered into a five-year Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility and a four-year $800 million Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which we refer to as the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. The proceeds were used to refinance the existing $800 million 2018 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility maturing January 23, 2021 and USD denominated $475 million 2018 Senior Unsecured Term Loan maturing January 23, 2023. The total borrowing capacity of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is approximately $1.4 billion USD. The Company reduced the margin on 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility and 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility by five basis points.\n\nGain from sale of real estate. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $22.1 million gain from the sale of real estate. On June 19, 2020, we completed the sale of a facility in our Warehouse segment, and began to transition the business to other nearby facilities, resulting in a $20.1 million gain from sale of real estate. On January 31, 2020, we received official notice from a customer to exercise its contractual call option to purchase land from us in Sydney, Australia, which we previously purchased for future development. We received sale proceeds upon exercise of the call option during the first quarter of 2020, resulting in a $2.5 million gain on sale.\n\n(b)Last participating and fixed dividend paid to holders of Series B Preferred Shares in connection with the conversion to common shares on the IPO date.\nThe following table presents the operating results of our quarry segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We sold our quarry business on July 1, 2020.\nWe also analyze the segment contribution (NOI) margin\u201d for each of our business segments, which we calculate as segment contribution (NOI) divided by segment revenues.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 and primarily consisted of $1.3 billion paid for the acquisitions of Cloverleaf and Lanier, $85.2 million paid for the acquisitions of real estate, which related to the asset acquisitions of Portfresh and MHW, and $217.2 million used in additions to property, buildings and equipment. These cash outflows were partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of our investment in the China JV for $14.3 million and $2.0 million return of investment in a joint venture during 2019.\nThroughout 2020, revenue growth has been driven by the impact of acquisitions. Additionally, we experienced higher than seasonal grocery demand within the retail sector due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this was mostly offset by decreased consumption in the food services sector due to stay-at-home orders and continued social distancing which resulted in lower services revenue due to the shift in demand. Later in the second quarter of 2020, the food service sector volumes began to increase as re-opening plans were implemented but still significantly lower than the prior comparable period. The increase was also partially due to higher economic occupancy in our same-store pool from higher commodity holdings and a slowdown in food service activity and exports, coupled with an increase in fixed committed contracts. The remaining increase was primarily due to a more favorable customer mix, improvements in our commercial terms and contractual rate escalations, the incremental revenue from our expansion of the Rochelle, Illinois facility and the opening of the development in Savannah. The foreign currency translation of revenue received by our foreign operations had a $5.6 million unfavorable impact during the year ended December 31, 2020, which was mainly driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the Australian dollar and to a lesser extent the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the Argentine peso.\n\u2022Equity acceleration costs representing the unrecognized expense for share-based awards that vest and convert to common shares in advance of the original negotiated vesting date and any other equity award changes resulting in accounting for the award as a modification.\n(3)During the first quarter of 2020, the Company refinanced its Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. As such, the 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility was in effect as of December 31, 2020 and the 2018 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility was in effect as of December 31, 2019. The above disclosure reflects N/A for the reporting date that the respective instrument was not in effect.\nOur corporate-level acquisition, litigation and other expenses consist of costs that we view outside of selling, general and administrative expenses with a high level of variability from period-to-period, and include the following:\n(7)Calculated as warehouse services contribution (NOI) divided by warehouse services revenue.\n We calculate EBITDA for Real Estate, or EBITDAre, in accordance with the standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, defined as, earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property, including gains or losses on change of control, impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustment to reflect share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. EBITDAre is a measure commonly used in our industry, and we present EBITDAre to enhance investor understanding of our operating performance. We believe that EBITDAre provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and useful life of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. We also calculate our Core EBITDA as EBITDAre further adjusted for acquisition, litigation and other expenses, bridge loan commitment fees, impairment of long-lived assets, loss on debt extinguishment and modification, share-based compensation expense, foreign currency exchange gain or loss, loss or gain on other asset disposals, loss or income on partially owned entities and reduction in EBITDAre from partially owned entities. We believe that the presentation of Core EBITDA provides a measurement of our operations that is meaningful to investors because it excludes the effects of certain items that are otherwise included in EBITDAre but which we do not believe are indicative of our core business operations. EBITDAre and Core EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and our EBITDAre and Core EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider our EBITDAre and Core EBITDA as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our calculations of EBITDAre and Core EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, including: \nSeveral years ago, we initiated a strategic shift in our transportation segment services and solutions. The intention of this strategic shift was to better focus our business on the operation of our temperature-controlled warehouses. Specifically, we have gradually exited certain commoditized, non-scalable, or low margin services we historically offered to our customers, in favor of more profitable and value-added programs, such as regional, national, truckload and retailer-specific multi-vendor consolidation services. We designed each value-added program to improve efficiency and reduce transportation and logistics costs to our warehouse customers, whose transportation spend typically represents the majority of their supply-chain costs. We believe this efficiency and cost reduction helps to drive increased client retention, as well as maintain high occupancy levels in our temperature-controlled warehouses. Over the last several years, we have made significant progress in implementing our strategic initiative of growing our transportation service offering in a way that complements our temperature-controlled warehouse business, for example, we have also added a dedicated fleet service offering through acquisitions. We intend to continue executing this strategy in the future.\nA detailed discussion of the 2020 year-over-year changes can be found below and a detailed discussion of the 2019 year-over-year changes can be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 2, 2020.\n(7)The Senior Unsecured Notes Series D is denominated in Euros and aggregates to Euro $400.0 million. The carrying value in the table above is the US dollar equivalent as of December 31, 2020.\n\u2022debt service obligations; and\nOur corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, business development, account management, project management, marketing, engineering, supply-chain solutions, human resources and information technology personnel, as well as expenses related to equity incentive plans, communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debt, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses are\n\u2022a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of greater than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00; and\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n\u2022our ATM Equity Program and related forward sale agreements; and\nWe declared the following dividends on our common shares during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n(c)Declared in March and included in the $20.1 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\n\u2022a maximum leverage ratio of less than or equal to 60% of our total asset value;\nn/r - not relevant\n\nQuarry segment contribution (NOI) was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to the sale of the quarry segment.\n\n(3)Included due to our investment in the Brazil JV in March 2020, thus prior year rates not included during period prior to our investment. The average rate used for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects the average rate from the date of our initial investment through the end of the year.\n\u2022Acquisition related costs include costs associated with transactions, whether consummated or not, such as advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees. We also include integration costs pre- and post-acquisition that reflect work being performed to facilitate merger and acquisition integration, such as employee retention expense and work associated with information systems and other projects including spending to support future acquisitions, which primarily consist of professional services.\n\u2022a minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio of greater than or equal to 1.75x.\nacquisition closed on December 30, 2020 with only one day of results for the year ended December 31, 2020. We consider the results to be immaterial and have excluded it for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSEC Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses\n(1) At the beginning of 2020 we reclassified one facility in our portfolio to the same store population from the non-same store population as a result of achieving normalized operations, two facilities were reclassified from to our non-same store population from our same store population as a result of the redevelopment impact to the Atlanta Major Market Strategy that is in progress, and one facility that was in the same-store population was sold. During 2020, we acquired four facilities in connection with the Nova Cold Acquisition, one facility in connection with the Newport Acquisition, two facilities in connection with the AM-C Acquisition, one facility in connection with the Caspers Acquisition, eight facilities in connection with the Halls Acquisition and 46 facilities in connection with the Agro Acquisition, all of which were added to the non-same store population. Additionally, during 2020 we completed a development upon land that was acquired in connection with the PortFresh Acquisition, which was added to the non-same store population.\nFinally, we incurred approximately $10.6 million for contemplated future expansion or development projects.\nThe expansion and development expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 are primarily driven by $74.8 million related to Plainville, Connecticut and $73.3 million related to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which are our two fully-automated development sites for Ahold Delhaize, $62.2 million related to the ongoing Atlanta major markets strategy project, $12.5 million in construction costs related to our Savannah expansion site, which was completed during the second quarter of 2020 and $22.0 million related to the Auckland, New Zealand expansion project which was started during the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2020, we invested $11.7 million in our Russellville expansion.\nOn November 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of New Jersey based Halls Warehouse Corporation for $489.2 million. Halls consisted of eight facilities near the Port of Newark. Halls also provides transportation\n(a)Declared in December 2018 and included in the $28.2 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\nOn December 30, 2020, we repaid $100.0 million of the 425000000 USD Tranche A-1 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A. This was funded using the Series D and E debt private placement issuance, more details on this debt issuance can be found under the Series A, B, C, D, and E Senior Unsecured Notes\u201d section below. In connection with this repayment, approximately $1.5 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility were written off. In addition, the interest rate swaps associated with the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A were terminated, resulting in an extinguishment fee of $16.4 million. After accounting for the refinance, the total borrowing capacity of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is approximately $1.3 billion USD.\nForeign Currency Translation Impact on Our Operations\nconsistent with the characteristics of the relevant warehouse. On a warehouse by warehouse basis, rack space generally ranges from three to four feet depending upon the type of facility and the nature of the customer goods stored therein. The number of our pallet positions is reviewed and updated quarterly, taking into account changes in racking configurations and room utilization.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $215.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $52.5 million, or 32.2%, compared to $163.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the 2019 and 2020 acquisitions, expansions and developments.\nOur business could be impacted due to inflation. We believe, however, that we are well positioned to be able to manage our business in an inflationary environment. Certain of our expenses are subject to normal inflationary pressures and this could lead to increases in the operating costs of our properties, such as wages and benefits, insurance, real estate taxes, utility expenses, equipment repair and replacement and other operating expenses. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases with increased operating efficiencies and the ability to increase prices in our customer contracts (many of which contain provisions for inflationary price escalators), we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies or increased storage or service charges.\n(5)Calculated as warehouse services contribution (NOI) divided by warehouse services revenue.\nQuarry revenue was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $4.2 million, or 48.8%, compared to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Quarry cost of operations was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $3.5 million, or 45.0%, compared to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in both revenues and cost of operations was a result of the sale of the limestone quarry which closed on July 1, 2020.\nAcquisitions\n(d)Declared in June and included in the $27.3 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\nTo the extent possible, estimates have been considered and recorded, as appropriate, for the items above based on the information available as of December 31, 2020. We will continue to evaluate these items until they are satisfactorily resolved and adjust our acquisition accounting accordingly, within the allowable measurement period (not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition), as defined by ASC 805.\nOur discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods described is based on our audited consolidated financial statements and our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, each of which has been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these historical financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For more information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following critical accounting discussion pertains to accounting policies management believes are most critical to the portrayal of our historical financial condition and results of operations and that require significant, difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to those of other companies.\n\u2022Non-offering related equity issuance expenses whether incurred through our initial public offering, follow-on offerings or secondary offerings.\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 3.1%, compared to $94.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in interest expense on the unhedged portion of our Senior Unsecured Term Loan A\nOur consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our operations outside the United States. Future fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and their impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations are inherently uncertain. As a result of the relative size of our international operations, these fluctuations may be material on our results of operations. Our revenues and expenses from our international operations are typically denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred. Therefore, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations and margins is partially mitigated.\nCredit Ratings\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6.9 million, which represented an increase of $1.7 million, from an income tax benefit of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to recognition by our U.S. TRS of a deferred income tax benefit to reduce its valuation allowance by $2.0 million. The reduction in the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to net deferred tax liabilities acquired that are a positive source of income for valuation allowance assessment purposes. This deferred income tax benefit was offset by an increase in income tax expense of $0.3 million primarily attributable to our foreign operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, there were 7,440,532 common shares sold under the 2020 ATM Equity Program, resulting in gross proceeds of $272.6 million. The proceeds were offset by $3.0 million of fees. Included in the shares sold under the 2020 ATM Equity Program were forward sale agreements to sell 4,346,101 common shares for gross proceeds of $162.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company settled 5,011,428 common shares for gross proceeds of $183.0 million under its ATM equity program. Pursuant to the respective forward sale agreements, the remaining 2,428,604 of shares must be settled by September 1, 2021 for gross proceeds of $89.6 million.\nWe have completed various acquisitions over the past year, which have increased our consolidated goodwill balance. On January 2, 2020, the Company completed the acquisitions of Nova Cold and Newport. The resulting intangible assets included goodwill of $71.7 million for the warehouse segment. On August 31, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of AM-C. The resulting intangible assets included goodwill of $10.4 million for the warehouse segment. The goodwill from Nova Cold, Newport, and AM-C was included in the annual goodwill impairment test as these acquisitions closed prior to October 1, 2020.\nThird-Party Managed. We receive a reimbursement of substantially all expenses for warehouses that we manage on behalf of third-party owners, with all reimbursements recognized as revenues under the relevant accounting guidance. We also earn management fees, incentive fees upon achieving negotiated performance and cost-savings results, or an applicable mark-up on costs. Cost of operations for our third-party managed segment is reimbursed on a pass-through basis (typically within two weeks).\nOperating Activities\nOn December 4, 2018, we entered into the 2018 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility to, among other things, (i) increase the revolver borrowing capacity from $450 million to $800 million, (ii) convert the credit facility (term loan and revolver) from a secured credit facility to an unsecured credit facility, and (iii) decrease the applicable interest rate margins from 2.35% to 1.45% and decrease the fee on unused borrowing capacity by 5 basis points. The terms of the revolver allow for the ability to draw proceeds in multiple currencies, up to $400 million. In connection with entering into the original agreement and subsequent amendments for the Term Loan A Credit Facility, we incurred approximately $8.9 million of debt issuance costs, which we amortize as interest expense under the effective interest method. As of December 31, 2019, the unamortized balance of Term Loan A debt issuance costs was $6.1 million and was included in Mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and term loans\u201d on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur net cash provided by financing activities was $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash provided by financing activities for the current period primarily consisted of $1.6 billion net proceeds from equity offerings during 2020, the $922.4 million received in connection with the issuance of the Series D and Series E senior unsecured notes which was partially offset by the related debt issuance costs of $10.1 million, the $177.1 million received in connection with the refinancing of our Senior Unsecured Term Loan and $636.8 million in proceeds from our revolving line of credit. These cash inflows were partially offset by $627.1 million of repayment on our revolving line of credit using the proceeds from the issuance of the Series D and Series E senior unsecured notes, $167.1 million of distributions paid, $156.8 million of repayments on term loan and mortgage notes and $23.7 million of payments related to lease obligations.\n(a)Declared in December 2019 and included in the $38.8 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\nExternal growth expenditures represent asset acquisitions or business combinations. Expansion and development capital expenditures are investments made to support both our customers and our warehouse expansion and development initiatives. It also includes investments in enhancing our information technology platform. Examples of capital expenditures associated with expansion and development initiatives include funding of construction costs, increases to warehouse capacity and pallet positions, acquisitions of reusable incremental material handling equipment, and implementing energy efficiency projects, such as thermal energy storage, LED lighting, motion-sensor technology, variable frequency drives for our fans and compressors, rapid-close doors and alternative-power generation technologies. Examples of capital expenditures to enhance our information technology platform include the delivery of new systems and software and customer interface functionality.\n\n\u2022a minimum unsecured debt service ratio of greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00.\n(5)Calculated as warehouse services revenue less labor and other services costs.\nCOVID-19\nWe evaluate the performance of our primary business segments based on their contribution (NOI) to our overall results of operations. We use the term segment contribution (NOI)\u201d to mean a segment's revenues less its cost of operations (excluding any depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, corporate-level selling, general and administrative expenses and corporate-level acquisition, litigation and other expenses). We use segment contribution (NOI) to evaluate our segments for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance in accordance with FASB ASC, Topic 280, Segment Reporting.\n\nCost of operations for our warehouse segment consists of power, other facilities costs, labor, and other services costs. Labor, the largest component of the cost of operations from our warehouse segment, consists primarily of employee wages, benefits, and workers' compensation. Trends in our labor expense are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, changes in customer requirements, workforce productivity, variability in costs associated with medical insurance and the impact of workplace safety programs, inclusive of the number and severity of workers' compensation claims. Labor expense is also impacted as a result of discretionary bonuses. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have incorporated certain inefficiencies such as staggered break schedules, social distancing, and other changes to process, all of which we expect to continue\nThird-party managed cost of operations was $279.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $38.3 million, or 15.9%, compared to $241.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a constant currency basis, third-party managed cost of operations was $279.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $38.6 million, or 16.0%, compared to the prior year. The increase was a result of higher business volume and is in line with the increase in revenues, partially offset by the exit of the facilities described above.\nSubsequent to the acquisition of MHW, during the first quarter of 2020, we exercised our call option to purchase land from the holder of the ground lease for $4.1 million. We also invested an additional $4.7 million for the Rochelle facility, which was previously opened during the second quarter of 2019.\nThroughput pallets at our same stores were 25.1 million pallets for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of 2.7% from 25.8 million pallets for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was the result of the COVID related impacts in various sectors and commodities, including the initial surge and ongoing elevated demand from our grocery retail sector, offset by the decrease in throughput in the food service sector and protein commodity. Same store warehouse services revenue per throughput pallet increased 4.1% compared to the prior year primarily as a result of contractual rate escalations, favorable business mix and an increase in higher-priced, value-added warehouse services such as repackaging, blast freezing, and case-picking, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation as previously discussed. On a constant currency basis, our same store services revenue per throughput pallet increased 4.4% compared to the prior year.\n(e)Declared in September and included in the $28.1 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\nSame Store Analysis\nOutstanding Indebtedness\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 one customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues, with revenues received of $257.3 million, $211.1 million and $212.8 million, respectively. The substantial majority of this customer's business relates to our third-party managed segment. We are reimbursed for substantially all expenses we incur in managing warehouses on behalf of third-party owners. We recognize these reimbursements as revenues under applicable accounting guidance, but generally do not affect our financial results because they are offset by the corresponding expenses that we recognize in our third-party managed segment cost of operations. Of the revenues received from this customer, $241.8 million, $195.4 million, and $196.3 million represented reimbursements for certain expenses we incurred during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that were offset by matching expenses included in our third-party managed cost of operations.\nThe maturity of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility is March 26, 2024, with the option to extend the maturity up to two times, each for a six-month period. In order to extend, the Company must not be in default, all representations and warranties must be in effect, obtain updated resolutions from loan parties, and an additional 6.25 bps extension fee must be paid. In connection with entering into the agreement, we incurred approximately $5.2 million of debt issuance costs for the 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which we amortize as interest expense under the straight-line method. Unamortized deferred financing costs as of December 31, 2019 of $2.8 million will continue to be amortized over the life of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, $5.8 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the revolving credit facility are included in Other assets\u201d in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\u2022a maximum secured leverage ratio of less than or equal to 40% to total asset value. Following a material acquisition, secured leverage ratio shall not exceed 45%;\n8, 2020. The notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed by the Company and the subsidiaries of the Company. The Company applied the proceeds of the private placement transaction to repay the indebtedness outstanding under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility incurred in connection with the funding of the Cloverleaf and Lanier acquisitions.\nExpansion and development\nAfter considering the common shares issued during 2020 and the shares subject to the forward sale agreements, the Company had approximately $227.4 million of availability remaining for distribution under the 2020 ATM Equity Program as of December 31, 2020.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our net cash provided by operating activities was $293.7 million, an increase of $57.5 million, or 24.3%, compared to $236.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is due to higher segment contribution in our same store results and as a result of our acquisitions during 2019 and 2020.\n(d)Declared in September and included in the $38.8 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\nto incur going forward. Our second largest cost of operations from our warehouse segment is power utilized in the operation of our temperature-controlled warehouses. As a result, trends in the price for power in the regions where we operate may have a significant effect on our financial results. We may from time to time hedge our exposure to changes in power prices through fixed rate agreements or, to the extent possible and appropriate, through rate escalations or power surcharge provisions within our customer contracts. Additionally, business mix impacts power expense depending on the temperature zone or type of freezing required. Other facilities costs include utilities other than power, property insurance, property taxes, sanitation (which include incremental supplies as a result of COVID-19), repairs and maintenance on real estate, rent under real property operating leases, where applicable, security, and other related facilities costs. Other services costs include equipment costs, warehouse consumables (e.g., shrink-wrap and uniforms), personal protective equipment to maintain the health and safety of our associates, warehouse administration and other related services costs.\nWe incur repair and maintenance expenses that include costs of normal maintenance and repairs and minor replacements that do not materially extend the life of the property or provide future economic benefits. Repair and maintenance expenses consist of expenses related to our existing temperature-controlled warehouse network and its existing supporting personal property and are reflected as operating expenses on our income statement. Examples of repair and maintenance expenses related to our warehouse portfolio include ordinary repair and maintenance on roofs, racking, walls, doors, parking lots and refrigeration equipment. Examples of repair and maintenance expenses related to personal property include ordinary repair and maintenance expenses on material handling equipment (e.g., fork lifts and pallet jacks) and related batteries. The following table sets forth our repair and maintenance expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nBy operation of law and in accordance with our customer contracts (other than leases), we typically receive warehouseman's liens on products held in our warehouses to secure customer payments. Such liens permit us to take control of the products and sell them to third parties in order to recover any monies receivable on a delinquent account, but such products may be perishable or otherwise not available to us for re-sale. Historically, in instances where we have warehouseman's liens and our customer sought bankruptcy protection, we have been successful in receiving critical vendor\u201d status, which has allowed us to fully collect on our accounts receivable during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceeding.\nInflation\n(1)The adjustments from our U.S. GAAP operating results to calculate our operating results on a constant currency basis are the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the comparable prior period.\nAdditionally, on August 31, 2020, we completed the acquisition of AM-C Warehouses for cash consideration of approximately $82.7 million, utilizing available cash on hand. AM-C Warehouses consisted of an owned facility in Mansfield, Texas and a leased facility in Grand Prairie, Texas. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of these facilities within our warehouse segment.\nWe define our same store\u201d population once a year at the beginning of the current calendar year. Our same store population includes properties that were owned or leased for the entirety of two comparable periods and that have reported at least twelve months of consecutive normalized operations prior to January 1 of the prior calendar year. We define normalized operations\u201d as properties that have been open for operation or lease after development or significant modification, including the expansion of a warehouse footprint or a warehouse rehabilitation subsequent to an event, such as a natural disaster or similar event causing disruption to operations. In addition, our definition of normalized operations\u201d takes into account changes in the ownership structure (e.g., purchase of a previously leased warehouse would result in different charges in the compared periods), which would impact comparability in our warehouse segment contribution (NOI).\nThe following table presents other items of income and expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nWe are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including how it will impact our customers and business partners. While we have not experienced significant disruptions on our operations from the COVID-19 pandemic thus far, we are unable to predict the future impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties arising from the pandemic. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with any degree of confidence, including the scope, severity, duration and geographies of the outbreak, the actions taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic or mitigate its impact as requested or mandated by governmental authorities or otherwise voluntarily taken by individuals or businesses, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the outbreak and containment measures, among others. Our business is deemed an essential business\u201d as defined by the Department of Homeland Security, which means that our associates are able to continue working in our facilities during shelter-in-place\u201d or stay-at-home\u201d orders. The outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States and other countries in which we operate, has significantly adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has led many nations, states and local authorities to institute shelter-in-place\u201d or stay-at-home\u201d orders, mandate business and school closures and restrict travel. Certain states and cities, including where we own properties, have development sites and where our principal place of business is located, have also reacted by instituting restrictions on travel, shelter in place\u201d rules, restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate, and/or restrictions on the types of construction projects that may continue. Many states and cities have begun implementing reopening\u201d plans, however, these restrictions vary widely by jurisdiction and may continue to change as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses. The negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are pervasive across a broad spectrum of industries, including industries in which we, our customers and business partners operate. Negative impacts from COVID-19 may negatively impact the business and operations of our customers and business partners (including our suppliers). Further, the impacts of a potentially worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets, consumer and business spending as well as other unanticipated consequences continue to remain unknown. The impacts of locations of outbreaks and actions mandated by governmental authorities or taken voluntarily by businesses and individuals to contain or mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and the timing of the repeal or loosening of such restrictions are also unknown. As a result, we cannot at this time predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. Refer to Risk Factors - Risks Related to Public Health Crises - We face various risks and uncertainties related to public health crises, including the recent and ongoing global outbreak of the novel coronavirus and variants (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic is growing and its impacts are uncertain and hard to measure and may have a material adverse effect on us.\nMaintenance capital expenditures are capitalized investments made to extend the life of, and provide future economic benefit from, our existing temperature-controlled warehouse network and its existing supporting personal property and information technology systems. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures related to our existing temperature-controlled warehouse network include replacing roofs and refrigeration equipment, and upgrading our racking systems. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures related to personal property include expenditures on material handling equipment (e.g., fork lifts and pallet jacks) and related batteries. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures related to information technology include expenditures on existing servers, networking equipment and current software. Maintenance capital expenditures do not include acquisition costs contemplated when underwriting the purchase of a building or costs which are incurred to bring a building up to Americold's operating standards. The following table sets forth our recurring maintenance capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nAs a result of the Cloverleaf Acquisition on May 1, 2019, we acquired expansion projects which were substantially completed during 2019. We incurred an additional $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 for these expansion projects.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Business and Financial Results\n\u2022Other costs relate to additional superannuation pension costs related to prior years upon review by the Australian Tax Office.\nAcquisitions and Joint Ventures\n(3)Includes non-real estate rent expense (equipment lease and rentals) of $9.4 million and $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSecurity Interests in Customers' Products\n\u2022a maximum total secured indebtedness ratio of less than 0.40 to 1.00;\nWe expect to utilize the same sources of capital we will rely on to meet our short-term liquidity requirements to also meet our long-term liquidity requirements, which include funding our operating activities, our debt service obligations and shareholder distributions, and our future development and acquisition activities. As previously discussed, the COVID-19 pandemic has created disruption among several industries. The outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. While we did not incur significant disruption during the year ended December 31, 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to predict the impact that the pandemic may have on the sources of capital upon which we rely.\nThe 2013 Mortgage Loans are collateralized by 15 warehouses. The terms governing the 2013 Mortgage Loans require us to maintain certain cash amounts in accounts that are restricted as to their use for the respective warehouses. As of December 31, 2020, the amount of restricted cash associated with the 2013 Mortgage Loans was $3.6 million. Additionally, if we do not maintain certain financial thresholds, including a debt service coverage ratio of 1.10x, the cash generated will further be temporarily restricted and limited to the use for scheduled debt service and operating costs. The 2013 Mortgage Loans are non-recourse to us subject to customary non-recourse carve-outs.\n(b)Declared in March and included in the $42.6 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into business combinations. In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations\u201d, we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is assigned to each reporting unit based upon the expected proportionate gross margin. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, land and buildings and improvements. Significant estimates and assumptions include subjective and/or complex judgments regarding items such as revenue growth rates, operating costs and margins, capital expenditures, tax rates, long-term growth rates, discount rates, customer attrition rates, economic lives and other factors, including estimating future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. The significant assumptions impacting the fair value of the acquired real property include estimates of indirect costs and entrepreneurial profit on the transaction, which were added to the replacement cost of the acquired assets in order to estimate their fair value in the market.\n(2) During 2020, we exited two third-party managed warehouses, which were not renewed upon expiration of the operating agreement.\nQuarry Segment\n(c)Declared in May and included in the $43.3 million declared, see description to the right regarding timing of payment.\nOn August 26, 2019, we entered into an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate sales price of $500.0 million of our common shares through an ATM equity program (an ATM Equity Program\u201d). There were no common shares sold under the ATM Equity Program during the first quarter of 2020. On April 16, 2020, this ATM Equity Program was terminated and replaced with a new ATM Equity Program, pursuant to which we may sell up to an aggregate sales price of $500.0 million of our common shares. Sales of our common shares made pursuant to the ATM Equity Program may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be at the market\u201d offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the NYSE, or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange, or as otherwise agreed between the applicable agent and us. Sales may also be made on a forward basis pursuant to separate forward sale agreements. We intend to use any net proceeds from sales of our common shares pursuant to the new ATM Equity Program for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, which may include funding development, expansion and acquisitions opportunities and the repayment of outstanding indebtedness.\nSeries A, B, C, D, and E Senior Unsecured Notes\nExternal Growth, Expansion and Development Capital Expenditures\nLoss on debt extinguishment, modifications and termination of derivative instruments\nImpairment of long-lived assets. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded impairment charges of $8.2 million and $13.5 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded impairment charges of $3.7 million for Quarry segment assets related to the sale of our quarry business, $2.1 million for Third-party managed segment assets within the leased facilities that we exited which could not be repurposed, $1.7 million for Warehouse segment assets related to a potential development project which we are no longer moving forward with and $0.5 million for Warehouse segment assets which were deemed unusable subsequent to the sale of our Boston facility. During the first quarter of 2019, management and our Board of Trustees formally approved the Atlanta Major Market Strategy\u201d plan which included the partial redevelopment of an existing warehouse facility. The partial redevelopment required the demolition of 75% of the current warehouse. As a result of this initiative, we recorded an impairment charge of $9.6 million during the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $2.9 million related to a domestic idle warehouse facility in anticipation of sale of the asset, which was completed during the second quarter of 2019. Each of these impaired assets previously mentioned related to the Warehouse segment. In addition, during the second quarter of 2019, management determined that certain international transportation related assets were going to be idled and we recorded an impairment charge of $0.9 million as a result. These impaired assets related to the transportation segment.\nAlso, on January 2, 2020, we completed the purchase of all outstanding membership interests of Newport Cold for cash consideration of $57.7 million, utilizing available cash on hand. Newport Cold consists of a single temperature-controlled warehouse located in St. Paul, Minnesota. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of this facility within our warehouse segment.\nThe following table sets forth our acquisitions, expansion and development capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands).\nSame store rent and storage revenues per economic occupied pallet increased 1.3% period-over-period, primarily driven by improvements in our commercial terms and contractual rate escalations. On a constant currency basis, our same store rent and storage revenues per occupied pallet increased 1.8% period-over-period.\nLoss on debt extinguishment, modifications and termination of derivative instruments. During the first quarter of 2020 we refinanced our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, which resulted in the write-off of certain unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.8 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we closed on a debt private placement of \u20ac750 million senior unsecured notes. In connection with this issuance, we repaid $100.0 million of our outstanding Senior Unsecured Term Loan A-1 facility, resulting in a write-off of $1.5 million of unamortized deferred financing costs. In connection with the partial repayment of this debt we also terminated the related interest rate swaps, resulting in the recognition of a portion of the remaining unamortized balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the previously designated hedges for $7.7 million. The unamortized balance of $8.7 million will be recognized through 2024. No such costs were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOther. In addition to our primary business segments, we owned and operated a limestone quarry in Carthage, Missouri for the first half of 2020. Revenues were generated from the sale of limestone mined at our quarry. Cost of operations for our quarry consisted primarily of labor, equipment, fuel and explosives. The sale of our quarry business segment was completed on July 1, 2020.\nWarehouse Segment\nOn November 6, 2018, we completed a debt private placement transaction consisting of (i) $200.0 million senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 4.68% due January 8, 2026 ( Series A\u201d) and (ii) $400.0 million senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 4.86% due January 8, 2029 ( Series B\u201d), collectively referred to as the debt private placement. The transaction closed on December 4, 2018. Interest is paid on January 8 and July 8 of each year until maturity, with the first payment occurring July 8, 2019. The notes are our general unsecured senior obligations and are guaranteed by us and our subsidiaries. We applied a portion of the proceeds of the debt private placement to complete the defeasance of the $600.0 million Americold 2010 LLC Trust, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2010, ART, or the 2010 Mortgage Loans. We applied the remaining proceeds to the Australian term loan and the New Zealand term loan, or the ANZ Loans.\nOn March 6, 2020, we acquired a 14.99% ownership interest in Superfrio Armaz\u00e9ns Gerais S.A. (SuperFrio) for Brazil Real Dollars of R$117.8 million, or approximately USD $25.7 million, inclusive of certain legal fees. We funded the purchase price using cash on hand. Our pro-rata share of the Brazil JV's results are included within (Loss) income from investments in partially owned entities\u201d. As of December 31, 2020, SuperFrio owns or operates 22 temperature-controlled warehouses in Brazil.\nOur results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes the four months for the activity of the AM-C and Caspers acquisitions, and the two months for the activity of the Halls acquisition. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes the one month and partial period of November for the activity of the MHW Acquisition, eight months of activity for the Cloverleaf Acquisition and Lanier Acquisition, and eleven months of activity for the PortFresh Acquisition. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\n\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nManagement's Overview\nAcquired properties will be included in the same store\u201d population if owned by us as of the first business day of each year, of the prior calendar year and still owned by us as of the end of the current reporting period, unless the property is under development. The same store\u201d pool is also adjusted to remove properties that were sold or entering development subsequent to the beginning of the current calendar year. As such, the same store\u201d population for the period ended December 31, 2020 includes all properties that we owned at January 2, which had both been owned and had reached normalized operations\u201d by January 2, 2019.\n\nTo perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. The estimation of the net present value of future cash flows is based upon varying economic assumptions, including significant assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating costs and margins, capital expenditures, tax rates, long-term growth rates and discount\nOur Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities, the Senior Unsecured Notes and 2013 Mortgage Loans all require financial statement reporting, periodic reporting of compliance with financial covenants, other established thresholds and performance measurements, and compliance with affirmative and negative covenants that govern our allowable business practices. The affirmative and negative covenants include continuation of insurance, maintenance of collateral, the maintenance of REIT status, and our ability to enter into certain types of transactions or exposures in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\n(4)During the first quarter of 2020, the Company refinanced its Senior Unsecured Term Loan A. As such, the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility was in effect as of December 31, 2020 and the 2018 Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility was in effect as of December 31, 2019.\nThroughput at our Warehouses\nThird-Party Managed Segment\nOn January 29, 2021, the Company expanded its 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility by $200 million. In addition, the Company paid $200 million of principal on Tranche A-1 of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Term Loan. The maturity, margin, and other terms of the 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility remain unchanged.\nOn January 2, 2020, we completed the purchase of all outstanding shares of Nova Cold for cash consideration of C$338.7 million (USD $260.6 million). Nova Cold consisted of four temperature-controlled facilities in Toronto, Calgary and Halifax. The acquisition was funded utilizing proceeds from the settlement of our April 2019 forward sale agreement combined with funds drawn on our 2018 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. Since the date of acquisition, we have reported the results of these facilities within our warehouse segment.\n\nThe acquisitions completed during the first quarter of 2020 relate to Newport and Nova Cold. The acquisitions completed during the third quarter of 2020 relate to AM-C Warehouses and Caspers. The acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter of 2020 related to Hall's and Agro. The acquisitions completed during 2019 relate to Cloverleaf, Lanier, PortFresh, and MHW, and excludes amounts related to the assets under construction for expansion and development projects, further detailed below.\nOur net cash used in investing activities was $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash used for the acquisitions of Agro, AM-C, Hall's, Newport and Nova Cold and accounted for as business combinations totaled $1.9 billion. Cash used in the acquisition of real estate was $25.5 million, which related to the asset acquisition of Caspers during the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, the net payment in settlement of a foreign currency forward contract in connection with the issuance of the Series D and Series E senior unsecured notes was $45.0 million. Additions to property, buildings and equipment were $376.8 million and $217.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in additions to property, buildings and equipment were driven by the Ahold, Atlanta, New Zealand, Savannah, Calgary, and Russellville expansion and development projects. Additionally, we invested $26.2 million in the Brazil JV during the first quarter of 2020. These outflows were offset by $80.2 million in proceeds from the sale of land and property, buildings, and equipment related to the sale of land in Sydney, the Quarry segment and the sale of the Boston facility.\nMaintenance Capital Expenditures and Repair and Maintenance Expenses\nHistorically Significant Customer\n\n\u2022our 2020 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility;\nOn December 30, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Agro Merchants for total consideration of $1.59 billion, including cash received of $47.5 million. This was comprised of cash consideration totaling $1.08 billion, of which $49.7 million was deferred, and the issuance of 14,166,667 common shares of beneficial interest to Oaktree, with a fair value of $512.1 million based upon the closing share price on December 29, 2020 of $36.15. Financing lease and sale-leaseback obligations associated with the acquisition totaled $119.9 million, and when added to the total consideration transferred brings the total transaction cost to approximately $1.7 billion. The one business day of results was immaterial to the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. Agro Merchants operates more than 236 million cubic feet of temperature-controlled warehouse and distribution space across 46 facilities and provides transportation services in the United States, Europe, Australia and Chile. We expect to report the results of these facilities within our warehouse segment in 2021, and the results of the transportation operations within our transportation segment in 2021.\nOur 2020 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility contains representations, covenants and other terms customary for a publicly traded REIT. In addition, it contains certain financial covenants, as defined in the credit agreement, including:\nIn March 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted amendments to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X and created Rule 13-01 to simplify disclosure requirements related to certain registered securities. The rule is effective January 4, 2021 but earlier compliance is permitted. The Company and the Operating Partnership have filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC registering, among other securities, debt securities of the Operating Partnership, which will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. As a result of the amendments to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, subsidiary issuers of obligations guaranteed by the parent are not required to provide separate financial statements, provided that the subsidiary obligor is consolidated into the parent company's consolidated financial statements, the parent guarantee is full and unconditional\u201d and, subject to certain exceptions as set forth below, the alternative disclosure required by Rule 13-01 is provided, which includes narrative disclosure and summarized financial information. Accordingly, separate consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership have not been presented. Furthermore, as permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi), the Company has excluded the summarized financial information for the Operating Partnership as the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company and the Operating Partnership are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and not provide incremental value to investors.\nInterest income. Interest income of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $5.1 million when compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This change was primarily driven by a lower interest rate of 0.51% earned during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2.3% during the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as a lower average cash balance as compared to the prior year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nFocus on Our Operational Effectiveness and Cost Structure\nIn connection with the refinancing of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility during the first quarter of 2020 the Company recorded $0.8 million to Loss on debt extinguishment and modifications\u201d in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, representing the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs from the 2018 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. These write-offs were a result of two lenders in the 2018\nWe continuously seek to execute on various initiatives aimed at streamlining our business processes and reducing our cost structure, including: realigning and centralizing key business processes and fully integrating acquired assets and businesses; implementing standardized operational processes; integrating and launching new information technology tools and platforms; instituting key health, safety, leadership and training programs; and capitalizing on the purchasing power of our network. Through the realignment of our business processes, we have acquired new talent and strengthened our service offerings. In order to reduce costs in our facilities, we have invested in energy efficiency projects, including LED lighting, thermal energy storage, motion-sensor technology, variable frequency drives for our fans and compressors, third party efficiency reviews and real-time monitoring of energy consumption, rapid open and close doors, and alternative-power generation technologies to improve the energy efficiency of our warehouses. We have also performed fine-tuning of our refrigeration systems, deployed efficient energy management practices, such as time-of-use and awareness, and have increased our participation in Power Demand Response programs with some of our power suppliers. These initiatives have allowed us to reduce our consumption of kilowatt hours and energy spend.\nBridge loan commitment fees. Corporate-level bridge loan commitment fees were $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2020 and 2019, we obtained a bridge loan to support the Agro and Cloverleaf acquisitions, respectively. The bridge loan facility for Agro and Cloverleaf ultimately did not need to be funded, and accordingly, we expensed the lender commitment and loan fee.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial

operates 238 temperature-controlled warehouses as of December 31, 2020. The warehouses are located in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and South America. \n\n- Revenues primarily come from rent, storage fees, and warehouse services fees. Cost of operations consists of power, facilities costs, labor, and services costs. \n\n- Net income was $24.6 million for 2020, compared to $48.2 million in 2019. The decrease was driven by higher interest expense, loss on debt modifications, and foreign currency exchange losses.\n\n- Warehouse revenues were $1.55 billion in 2020, up 12.5% from 2019, driven by acquisitions. Warehouse contribution (NOI) was $520.3 million, up 16.3%. \n\n- Transportation revenues were $142.2 million, down 1.8% due to exiting some business lines. Transportation contribution was $18.8 million, up 4.1%.\n\n- Third-party managed revenues were $291.8 million, up 15.3% due to higher volumes. Contribution was $12.2 million, up 4.0%.\n\n- Capital expenditures were $2.17 billion in 2020, largely driven by acquisitions, expansions, and developments of warehouses. \n\n- The company has investment grade credit ratings from Fitch, DBRS Morningstar, and Moody's. Total debt was $2.96 billion as of December 31, 2020.\n\n- The company expects its sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to meet its operational and capital requirements in the near term.\n\nIn summary, the company continued to expand its warehouse network through acquisitions and developments in 2020. It has maintained a solid financial position and credit profile. The COVID-19 pandemic has not significantly disrupted operations so far."}
