Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Unless otherwise indicated, all references to years or year-end refers to the fiscal year ending September 30 and dollars are in thousands, except per share data)\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company\nGriffon Corporation (the Company\u201d or Griffon\u201d) is a diversified management and holding company that conducts business through wholly-owned subsidiaries. Griffon oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among them and manages their capital structures. Griffon provides direction and assistance to its subsidiaries in connection with acquisition and growth opportunities as well as in connection with divestitures. In order to further diversify, Griffon also seeks out, evaluates and, when appropriate, will acquire additional businesses that offer potentially attractive returns on capital.\nHeadquartered in New York, N.Y., the Company was founded in 1959 and is incorporated in Delaware. Griffon is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol GFF.\nOn June 4, 2018, Clopay Building Products Company, Inc. (\"CBP\") acquired CornellCookson, Inc. (\"CornellCookson\"), a leading US manufacturer and marketer of rolling steel door and grille products designed for commercial, industrial, institutional and retail use, for $180,000, excluding certain post-closing adjustments. After taking into account the estimated present value of tax benefits resulting from the transaction, the effective purchase price is approximately $170,000. CornellCookson is expected to generate approximately $200,000 in revenue in the first full year of operations. The accounts, affected for preliminary adjustments to reflect fair market values assigned to assets purchased and liabilities assumed, and results of operations of CornellCookson, are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition of June 4, 2018. See Note 2, Acquisitions.\nOn November 16, 2017, Griffon announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell Clopay Plastic Products Company, Inc. (\"PPC\") and on February 6, 2018, completed the sale to Berry Global, Inc. (\"Berry\") for approximately $475,000. As a result, Griffon classified the results of operations of the PPC business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets. All results and information presented exclude PPC unless otherwise noted. See Note 6, Discontinued Operations.\nOn October 2, 2017, Griffon acquired ClosetMaid LLC (\"ClosetMaid\") for approximately $185,700, inclusive of post-closing adjustments, or $165,000 net of the estimated present value of tax benefits resulting from the transaction. ClosetMaid, founded in 1965, is a leading North American manufacturer and marketer of wood and wire closet organization, general living storage and wire garage storage products and sells to some of the largest home center retail chains, mass merchandisers, and direct-to-builder professional installers in North America. The accounts, affected for preliminary adjustments to reflect fair market values assigned to assets purchased and liabilities assumed, and results of operations of ClosetMaid are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition of October 2, 2017. See Note 2, Acquisitions.\nGriffon currently conducts its continuing operations through two reportable segments:\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Home & Building Products (\"HBP\") consists of two companies, The AMES Companies, Inc.

Gross profit for 2018 was $529,560 compared to $408,116 in 2017, with gross margin as a percent of sales ( gross margin\u201d) of 26.8%, consistent with the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses from continuing operations of $433,110 increased 28% from the prior year amount of $339,089, primarily due to the inclusion of $7,597 of acquisition related expenditures as well as incremental SG&A expenses associated with these acquisitions. SG&A for 2018, as a percent of revenue, was 21.9%, compared to 22.2% in the prior year.\nInterest expense from continuing operations in 2018 of $65,568 increased 27% compared to the prior year of $51,513, primarily as a result of increased debt levels related to the October 2017 add-on offering of $275,000 of 5.25% senior notes due 2022, partially offset by lower outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOther income (expense) from continuing operations of $1,231 in 2018 and $(880) in 2017 consists primarily of currency exchange transaction gains and losses from receivables and payables held in non-functional currencies, and net gains on investments.\nGriffon reported pretax income from continuing operations of $33,810 for the year ended September 30, 2018 compared to $16,698 for the prior year. In 2018, the Company recognized a tax provision of 1.6% compared to 6.5% in 2017. The 2018 tax rate included $9,384 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, primarily from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and the provisional amount recorded for the IRC section 965 transition tax on the untaxed foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits, related to the TCJA. The 2017 tax rate included $8,274 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, related primarily to excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense, a federal domestic production activities deduction and a federal R&D credit.\nExcluding the discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, and certain other items from continuing operations, as listed below, the effective tax rates for the year ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were 33.8% and 39.7%, respectively. These rates reflect the impact of tax reserves and changes in earnings mix between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\nIncome from continuing operations was $33,255, or $0.78 per share, for 2018 compared to $17,783, or $0.41 per share in the prior year.\nThe current year results included the following from continuing operations:\n- Acquisition costs of $7,597 ($5,047, net of tax, or $0.12 per share);\n- Special dividend ESOP charges of $3,220 ($2,125, net tax, or $0.05);\n- Secondary equity offering costs of $1,205 ($795, net tax, or $0.02);\n- Cost of life insurance benefit of $2,614 ($248, net tax, or $0.01); and\n- Discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $9,384 or $0.22 per share, primarily from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and the provisional amount recorded for the IRC section 965 transition tax on the untaxed foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits related to the TCJA.\nThe prior year results included the following from continuing operations:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Acquisition costs of $9,617 ($6,145, net of tax, or $0.14 per share);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n- Contract settlement charges of $5,137 ($3,300, net of tax, or $0.08 per share); and\n- Discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $8,274, or $0.19 per share.\nExcluding these items from both reporting periods, 2018 Income from continuing operations would have been $32,086, or $0.76 per share compared to $18,954, or $0.44 per share, in 2017.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nRevenue from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2017 was $1,524,997, compared to $1,477,035 in the prior year, an increase of 3%. This resulted from increased revenue at Home & Building Products, partially offset by decreased revenue at Telephonics. Gross profit for 2017 was $408,116 compared to $400,693 in 2016, with gross margin as a percent of sales ( gross margin\u201d) of 26.8% and 27.1%, respectively.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses from continuing operations of $339,089 increased 7% from the prior year amount of $318,353. SG&A for 2017, as a percent of revenue, was 22.2%, compared to 21.6% in the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of $9,617 of acquisition related expenditures.\nInterest expense from continuing operations in 2017 of $51,513 increased 3% compared to the prior year of $49,943 primarily as a result of increased debt levels related to the May 2016 add-on offering of $125,000 of 5.25% senior notes due 2022 and higher outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOther income (expense) from continuing operations of $(880) in 2017 and $(250) in 2016 consists primarily of currency exchange transaction gains and losses from receivables and payables held in non-functional currencies, and net gains on investments.\nGriffon reported pretax income from continuing operations of $16,698 for the year ended September 30, 2017 compared to $32,213 for the prior year. In 2017, the Company recognized a tax benefit of 6.5% compared to a tax provision of 38.6% in 2016. The 2017 tax rate included $8,274 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, related primarily to excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense, a federal domestic production activities deduction and a federal R&D credit. The 2016 tax rate included an $857 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, related primarily to excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense and the release of unrecognized tax benefits.\nExcluding the discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, and certain other items from continuing operations, as listed below, the effective tax rates for the year ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were 39.7% and 41.3%, respectively. These rates reflect the impact of tax reserves and changes in earnings mix between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\nIncome from continuing operations was $17,783, or $0.41 per share, for 2017 compared to $19,781, or $0.45 per share in the prior year.\nThe 2017 results included the following from continuing operations:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Acquisition costs of $9,617 ($6,145, net of tax, or $0.14 per share);\n</td> </tr>\n</table> - Contract settlement charges of $5,137 ($3,300, net of tax, or $0.08 per share); and\n- Discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $8,274, or $0.19 per share.\nThe 2016 results included discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $857 or $0.02 per share from continuing operations.\nExcluding these items from both reporting periods, 2017 Income from continuing operations would have been $18,954, or $0.44 per share compared to $18,924, or $0.43 per share, in 2016.\nGriffon evaluates performance based on Earnings per share and Net income excluding restructuring charges, loss on debt extinguishment, acquisition related expenses, discrete and certain other tax items, as well other items that may affect comparability, as applicable.

(\"CM\"), Harper and Kelkay, and CBP's acquisition of CornellCookson (\"CC\"), as well as increased favorable mix and price at CBP and AMES, and volume increases at CBP and AMES' non US locations, offset by AMES US decrease due to unfavorable weather. 2018 CM and CC revenue was $311,568 and $66,654, respectively. Organic growth was 7%.\nSegment operating profit in 2018 was $130,487 compared to $89,495 in 2017, an increase of $40,992, or 46%. Excluding the impact of acquisition related costs, Segment operating profit would have been $132,867 in the current year and $90,219 in the prior year, increasing 47% from the prior year, primarily driven by the increased revenue as noted above, partially offset by increased steel and resin costs, and tariffs. Segment depreciation and amortization increased $7,986 from the prior year primarily from acquisitions.\nOn June 4, 2018, CBP completed the acquisition of CornellCookson, a leading US manufacturer and marketer of rolling steel door and grille products designed for commercial, industrial, institutional and retail use, for $180,000, excluding certain post-closing adjustments. After taking into account the net of the estimated present value of tax benefits resulting from the transaction, the effective purchase price is approximately $170,000. The acquisition of CornellCookson substantially expanded CBP's non-residential product offerings, and added an established professional dealer network focused on rolling steel door and grille products for commercial, industrial, institutional and retail use. CornellCookson is expected to generate approximately $200,000 in revenue in the first full year of operations.\nOn February 13, 2018, AMES acquired Kelkay, a leading United Kingdom manufacturer and distributor of decorative outdoor landscaping products sold to garden centers, retailers and grocers in the UK and Ireland for approximately $56,118 (GBP 40,452), subject to contingent consideration of up to GBP 7,000. This acquisition broadened AMES' product offerings in the market and increased its in-country operational footprint. Kelkay is expected to contribute approximately $40,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn November 6, 2017, AMES acquired Harper Brush Works ( Harper\u201d), a division of Horizon Global, for approximately $5,000. Harper is a leading U.S. manufacturer of cleaning products for professional, home, and industrial use. The acquisition will broaden AMES' long-handle tool offering in North America to include brooms, brushes, and other cleaning tools and accessories. The acquisition is expected to contribute approximately $10,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn October 2, 2017, Griffon completed the acquisition of ClosetMaid, a market leader of home storage and organization products, for approximately $185,700, inclusive of post-closing adjustments, or $165,000 net of the estimated present value of tax benefits resulting from the transaction. ClosetMaid adds to Griffon's Home and Building Products segment, complementing and diversifying Griffon's portfolio of leading consumer brands and products. ClosetMaid, as expected, generated over $300,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nPrior year acquisitions\nOn September 29, 2017, AMES Australia completed the acquisition of Tuscan Landscape Group Pty, Ltd. (\"Tuscan Path\"), a leading Australian provider of pots, planters, pavers, decorative stone, and garden decor products, for approximately $18,000\n(AUD 22,250). The acquisition of Tuscan Path broadens AMES' outdoor living and lawn and garden business, and will strengthen AMES' industry leading position in Australia. Tuscan Path, as expected, generated approximately AUD 25,000 of revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn July 31, 2017, The AMES Companies, Inc. acquired La Hacienda Limited, a leading United Kingdom outdoor living brand of unique heating and garden decor products, for approximately $11,400 (GBP 9,175). The acquisition of La Hacienda broadens AMES' global outdoor living and lawn and garden business and supports AMES' UK expansion strategy. La Hacienda, as expected, generated approximately GBP 14,000 of revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nOn December 30, 2016, AMES Australia acquired Home Living (\"Hills\") for approximately $6,051 (AUD 8,400). Hills, founded in 1946, is a market leader in the supply of clothesline, laundry and garden products. The Hills acquisition adds to AMES' existing broad category of products and enhances its lawn and garden product offerings in Australia. Hills, as expected, generated approximately AUD 10,000 of revenue in the first twelve months after acquisition.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nSegment revenue increased $71,927, or 7%, compared to the prior year period. AMES revenue increased 6%, primarily due to increased UK market expansion and contributions from the La Hacienda and Hills acquisitions, and increased Canadian snow and lawn tools sales. CBP revenue increased 8% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased volume, pricing and favorable mix.\nSegment operating profit in 2017 was $89,495 compared to $79,682 in 2016, an increase of $9,813, or 12%, driven by the increased revenue noted above and favorable product mix, partially offset by increased steel and resin costs. Segment depreciation and amortization increased $1,280 from the prior year period.\nDefense Electronics\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>326,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>411,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>435,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>10,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract settlement charges\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Compared to 2017\nRevenue in 2018 decreased $85,390, or 21%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreased maritime surveillance radar and electronic countermeasure systems revenue.\nSegment operating profit decreased $4,681 from the prior year primarily due to the decreased revenue noted above and the impact of revised estimates to complete remaining performance obligations on certain airborne intercommunications systems. The prior year included a $5,137 contract settlement charge.\nDuring 2018, Telephonics was awarded new contracts and incremental funding on existing contracts approximating $320,300. Contract backlog was $344,900 at September 30, 2018 with 69% expected to be fulfilled in the next 12 months; backlog was $350,900 at September 30, 2017. Backlog is defined as unfilled firm orders for products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer or Congress, in the case of the U.S. government agencies. The decrease in backlog was primarily due to the timing of various U.S. and international contract awards associated with radar and surveillance opportunities.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nRevenue in 2017 decreased $23,965, or 6%, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to decreased multi-mode radar revenue and certain ground surveillance systems, partially offset by favorable performance on electronic countermeasure systems revenue.\nSegment operating profit decreased $12,858 from the prior year period. During 2017, Telephonics recorded a $5,137 charge, consisting of a settlement in the amount of $4,250 plus 2% interest and associated legal costs, related to certain amounts the civil division of the US Department of Justice indicated it believed it was owed from Telephonics with respect to certain US government contracts, performed during the 2005 to 2013 time period, in which Telephonics acted as a subcontractor. Excluding these charges, segment operating profit in the current year would have been $35,080, a $7,721 decrease from the prior year period primarily due to the decreased revenue noted above, unfavorable program mix and the impact of revised estimates to complete remaining performance obligations on certain radar and communication programs.\nUnallocated Amounts\nFor 2018, unallocated amounts, consisting primarily of corporate overhead costs, totaled $45,812 compared to $42,398 in 2017, with the increase primarily due to compensation, incentive and relocation costs.\nFor 2017, unallocated amounts, which consist primarily of corporate overhead costs, totaled $42,398 compared to $40,393 in 2016, with the increase primarily due to compensation and incentive costs.\nSegment Depreciation and Amortization\nSegment depreciation and amortization of $55,334 in 2018 compared to the prior year of $47,398, increased $7,936 primarily due to depreciation and amortization on assets acquired in acquisitions.\nSegment depreciation and amortization of $47,398 in 2017 compared to the prior year of $45,851, increased $1,547 primarily due to depreciation for new assets placed in service.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nDuring 2018, total other comprehensive income, net of taxes, of $26,369 included a gain of $14,866 related to the removal of PPC's foreign currency translation loss, which is considered in the gain on the disposal of discontinued operations; a loss of $5,463 from foreign currency translation adjustments primarily due to the weakening of the Euro, Canadian, British and Australian currencies, all in comparison to the U.S. Dollar; a $16,381 gain from Pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily associated with a $10,053 SERP benefit related to the passing of our Chairman of the Board and higher assumed discount rates compared to the prior year; and a $585 gain on cash flow hedges.\nDuring 2017, total other comprehensive income, net of taxes, of $20,760 consisted of a $10,667 income on Foreign currency translation adjustments primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro, Canadian, British, Brazilian and Australian currencies, all in comparison to the U.S. Dollar; a $9,203 gain from Pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily due to higher assumed discount rates compared to the prior year and a $890 gain on cash flow hedges.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nClopay Plastics Products\nOn November 16, 2017, Griffon announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell PPC and on February 6, 2018, completed the sale to Berry for approximately $475,000. As a result, Griffon classified the results of operations of the PPC business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets. All results and information presented exclude PPC unless otherwise noted. PPC is a global leader in the development and production of embossed, laminated and printed specialty plastic films for hygienic, health-care and industrial products and sells to some of the world's largest consumer products companies.\nInstallation Services and Other Discontinued Activities\nIn 2008, as a result of the downturn in the residential housing market, Griffon exited substantially all operating activities of its Installation Services segment which sold, installed and serviced garage doors and openers, fireplaces, floor coverings, cabinetry and a range of related building products, primarily for the new residential housing market. Griffon sold eleven units, closed one unit and merged two units into CBP. Operating results of substantially this entire segment have been reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for all periods presented; Installation Services is excluded from segment reporting.\nGriffon substantially concluded remaining disposal activities in 2009. There was no reported revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016. During the year ended September 30, 2017, Griffon recorded $5,700 of reserves in discontinued operations related to historical environmental remediation efforts and to increase the reserve for homeowner association claims (HOA) related to installation services.\nAt September 30, 2018, Griffon's liabilities for PPC and Installations Services and other discontinued operations primarily related to insurance claims, income taxes and product liability, warranty and environmental reserves and stay and transaction bonuses totaling liabilities of approximately $9,858. See Note 6, Discontinued Operations.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nManagement assesses Griffon's liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, bank lines of credit and the ability to attract long-term capital under satisfactory terms. Griffon believes it has sufficient liquidity available to invest in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing its capital structure on both a short-term and long-term basis.\nThe following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flows from Continuing Operations\n</td> <td>Years Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Flows Provided By (Used In):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(5,680\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71,337\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>39,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(700\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2018 was $66,446 compared to $49,151 in 2017. Cash provided by income from continuing operations, adjusted for non-cash expenditures, was offset by a net increase in working capital, primarily from increased inventory. 2018 included $14,821 of cash expenditures related to items that affect comparability, primarily related to acquisition diligence compared to $1,318 in 2017.\nDuring 2018, Griffon used $5,680 in investing activities from continuing operations compared to $71,337 used in 2017. Acquired businesses totaled $430,932 in 2018 compared to $34,719 in 2017. During 2018, Griffon completed the acquisitions of ClosetMaid for approximately $185,700, inclusive of post-closing adjustments, or $165,000 net of the estimated present value of tax benefits; Harper for approximately $5,000; Kelkay for approximately $56,118 (GBP 40,452), subject to contingent consideration of GBP 7,000; and CornellCookson for approximately $180,000, excluding the estimated present value of tax benefits and $12,426 of post-closing adjustments, primarily consisting of a working capital adjustment, of which $9,219 was paid in October 2018. On February 6, 2018, the Company completed the sale of PPC to Berry for approximately $475,000.\nDuring 2017, cash used in investing activities from continuing operations were primarily driven by acquisitions and capital expenditures. During 2017 Griffon completed the acquisitions of Tuscan Landscape Group Pty, Ltd. for approximately $18,000 (AUD 22,250); La Hacienda for approximately $11,400 (GBP 9,175); and Hills Home Living for approximately $6,051 (AUD 8,400).\nIn 2018, capital expenditures, net, totaled $49,475 compared to $34,794 in 2017.\nCash provided by financing activities from continuing operations in 2018 totaled $39,065 compared to a use of cash of $700 in the prior year. On October 2, 2017, Griffon completed an add-on offering of $275,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2022 in an unregistered offering through a private placement. The $275,000 senior notes were issued under the same indenture pursuant to which Griffon previously issued $725,000 in aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% Senior Notes due 2022. The proceeds were used to purchase ClosetMaid and reduce the outstanding balance of Griffon's revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Agreement\")). At September 30, 2018, there were $25,000 in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, compared to $144,216 in outstanding borrowings at the same date in the prior year.\nOn each of August 3, 2016 and August 1, 2018, Griffon's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50,000 of Griffon's outstanding common stock. Under these share repurchase programs, the Company may purchase shares in the open market, including pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan, or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2018, Griffon purchased 2,088,739 shares of common stock under these repurchase programs, for a total of $41,110 or $19.68 per share. At September 30, 2018, $58,327\nremains under the August 2016 and 2018 Board authorized repurchase programs. In addition to the repurchases under Board authorized programs, during 2018, 199,978 shares, with a market value of $4,495, or $22.48 per share, were withheld to settle employee taxes due upon the vesting of restricted stock.\nCash used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2017 included net proceeds from debt of $62,989, a share premium payment of $24,997 related to the settlement of Griffon's 4% convertible subordinated notes, $15,841 for the repurchase of common stock, $10,908 for the purchase of common stock for Griffon's ESOP plan and $10,325 for the payment of dividends. On January 17, 2017, Griffon settled the convertible debt for $173,855 with $125,000 in cash, utilizing borrowings under the Credit Agreement, and $48,858, or 1,954,993 shares of common stock issued from treasury.\nDuring 2018, the Board of Directors approved four quarterly cash dividends each for $0.07 per share. In addition, on March 7, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share paid on April 16, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 29, 2018. On November 14, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.0725 per share, payable on December 20, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 29, 2018.\nAs of September 30, 2018, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $24,900. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the U.S., and we do not currently anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event we determine that funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the U.S., we will be required to accrue and pay U.S taxes to repatriate these funds (unless U.S. taxes have already been paid).\nPayments related to Telephonics revenue are received in accordance with the terms of development and production subcontracts; certain of such receipts are progress or performance based payments. With respect to HBP, uncollected receivables have been immaterial in amount.\nA small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon's consolidated revenue. In 2018:\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>a.\n</td> <td>The U.S. Government and its agencies, through prime and subcontractor relationships, represented 10% of Griffon's consolidated revenue and 62% of Telephonics' revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>b.\n</td> <td>Home Depot represented 19% of Griffon's consolidated revenue and 23% of HBP's revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNo other customer exceeded 10% or more of consolidated revenue. Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon's largest customers and our relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to change and may fluctuate materially. The loss of all or a portion of volume from any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on Griffon's liquidity and operations.\nAt September 30, 2018, Griffon had debt, net of cash and equivalents, as follows:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and Equivalents and Debt\n</td> <td>At September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payables and current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td>13,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, net of current maturities\n</td> <td>1,108,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>968,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt discount and issuance costs\n</td> <td>13,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt\n</td> <td>1,134,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>992,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt, net of cash and equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,064,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>944,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 2, 2017, in an unregistered offering through a private placement under Rule 144A, Griffon completed the add-on offering of $275,000 principal amount of its 5.25% senior notes due 2022, at 101.0% of par, to Griffon's previously issued $125,000 principal amount of its 5.25% senior notes due 2022, at 98.76% of par, completed on May 18, 2016 and $600,000 5.25% senior notes due in 2022, at par, which was completed on February 27, 2014 (collectively the Senior Notes\u201d). As of September 30, 2018, outstanding Senior Notes due totaled $1,000,000; interest is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1. The net proceeds of the $275,000 add-on offering were used to acquire ClosetMaid, with the remaining proceeds used to pay down outstanding loan borrowings under Griffon's Revolving Credit Facility (the \"Credit Agreement\"). The net proceeds of the previously issued $125,000 add-on offering were used to pay down outstanding revolving loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement.\nProceeds from the $600,000 5.25% senior notes due in 2022 were used to redeem $550,000 of 7.125% senior notes due 2018, to pay a call and tender offer premium of $31,530 and to make interest payments of $16,716, with the balance used to pay a portion of the related transaction fees and expenses. In connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes, all obligations under the $550,000 of 7.125% senior notes due in 2018 were discharged.\nThe Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Griffon guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries, and subject to certain covenants, limitations and restrictions. On February 5, 2018, July 20, 2016 and June 18, 2014, Griffon exchanged all of the $275,000, $125,000 and $600,000 Senior Notes, respectively, for substantially identical Senior Notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933 via an exchange offer. The fair value of the Senior Notes approximated $990,000 on September 30, 2018 based upon quoted market prices (level 1 inputs). In connection with the issuance and exchange of the $275,000 senior notes, Griffon capitalized $8,472 of underwriting fees and other expenses; in addition to $13,329 capitalized under the previously issued $725,000 Senior Notes. All capitalized fees for the Senior Notes will amortize over the term of the notes and, at September 30, 2018, $14,830 remained to be amortized.\nOn March 22, 2016, Griffon amended its Credit Agreement to increase the credit facility from $250,000 to $350,000, extend its maturity from March 13, 2020 to March 22, 2021, and modify certain other provisions of the facility. On October 2, 2017 and on May 31, 2018, Griffon amended the Credit Agreement in connection with the ClosetMaid and the CornellCookson acquisitions, respectively, to modify the net leverage covenant. The facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility with a limit of $50,000 and a multi-currency sub-facility of $100,000. The Credit Agreement provides for same day borrowings of base rate loans. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and re-borrowed at any time, subject to final maturity of the facility or the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement. Interest is payable on borrowings at either a LIBOR or base rate benchmark rate, in each case without a floor, plus an applicable margin, which adjusts based on financial performance. Current margins are 1.75% for base rate loans and 2.75% for LIBOR loans. The Credit Agreement has certain financial maintenance tests including a maximum total leverage ratio, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants place limits on Griffon's ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, and make restricted payments and investments. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Griffon's material domestic subsidiaries and are secured, on a first priority basis, by substantially all domestic assets of the Company and the guarantors, and a pledge of not greater than 65% of the equity interest in Griffon's material, first-tier foreign subsidiaries (except that a lien on the assets of Griffon's material domestic subsidiaries securing a limited amount of the debt under the credit agreement relating to Griffon's Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") ranks pari passu with the lien granted on such assets under the Credit Agreement). At September 30, 2018, under the Credit Agreement, there were $25,000 outstanding borrowings; outstanding standby letters of credit were $14,623; and $310,377 was available, subject to certain loan covenants, for borrowing at that date.\nOn December 21, 2009, Griffon issued $100,000 principal of 4% convertible subordinated notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes\u201d). On July 14, 2016, Griffon announced that it would settle, upon conversion, up to $125,000 of the conversion value of the 2017 Notes in cash, with amounts in excess of $125,000, if any, to be settled in shares of Griffon common stock. On January 17, 2017, Griffon settled the convertible debt for $173,855 with $125,000 in cash, utilizing borrowings under the Credit Agreement, and $48,858, or 1,954,993 shares of common stock issued from treasury.\nIn September 2015 and March 2016, Griffon entered into mortgage loans in the amount of $32,280 and $8,000, respectively, and were due to mature in September 2025 and April 2018, respectively. The mortgage loans were secured and collateralized by four properties occupied by Griffon's subsidiaries and were guaranteed by Griffon. The loans had an interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.50%. The loans were paid off during the year ended September 30, 2018.\nIn August 2016, Griffon's ESOP entered into an agreement that refinanced the existing ESOP loan into a new Term Loan in the amount of $35,092 (the \"Agreement\"). The Agreement also provided for a Line Note with $10,908 available to purchase shares of Griffon common stock in the open market. During 2017, Griffon's ESOP purchased 621,875 shares of common stock for a total of $10,908 or $17.54 per share, under a borrowing line that has now been fully utilized. On June 30, 2017, the Term Loan and Line Note were combined into a single Term Loan. The Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.0%. The Term Loan requires quarterly principal payments of $569 with a balloon payment due at maturity on March 22, 2020. As a result of the special cash dividend of $1.00 per share, paid on April 16, 2018, the outstanding balance of the Term Loan was reduced by $5,705. As of September 30, 2018, $34,508, net of issuance costs, was outstanding under the Term Loan. The Term Loan is secured by shares purchased with the proceeds of the loan and with a lien on a specific amount of Griffon assets (which lien ranks pari passu with the lien granted on such assets under the Credit Agreement) and is guaranteed by Griffon.\nTwo Griffon subsidiaries have capital leases outstanding for real estate located in Troy, Ohio and Ocala, Florida. The leases mature in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and bear interest at fixed rates of approximately 5.0% and 8.0%, respectively. The Troy, Ohio\nlease is secured by a mortgage on the real estate and is guaranteed by Griffon. The Ocala, Florida lease contains two five-year renewal options. As of September 30, 2018, $7,423 was outstanding, net of issuance costs.\nIn November 2012, Garant G.P. ( Garant\u201d) entered into a CAD 15,000 ($11,498 as of September 30, 2018) revolving credit facility. The facility accrues interest at LIBOR (USD) or the Bankers Acceptance Rate (CDN) plus 1.3% per annum (3.70% LIBOR USD and 3.24% Bankers Acceptance Rate (CDN) as of September 30, 2018). The revolving facility matures in October 2019. Garant is required to maintain a certain minimum equity. As of September 30, 2018, there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility with CAD 15,000 ($11,498 as of September 30, 2018) available for borrowing.\nIn July 2016, Griffon Australia Holdings Pty Ltd and its Australian subsidiaries (\"Griffon Australia\") entered into an AUD 30,000 term loan and an AUD 10,000 revolver. The term loan refinanced two existing term loans and the revolver replaced two existing lines. In December 2016, the amount available under the revolver was increased from AUD 10,000 to AUD 20,000 and, in March 2017 the term loan commitment was increased by AUD 5,000. In September 2017, the term commitment was increased by AUD 15,000. The term loan requires quarterly principal payments of AUD 1,250 plus interest with a balloon payment of AUD 37,125 due upon maturity in October 2019, and accrues interest at Bank Bill Swap Bid Rate BBSY\u201d plus 2.00% per annum (3.99% at September 30, 2018). As of September 30, 2018, the term had an outstanding balance of AUD 40,875 ($29,546 as of September 30, 2018). The revolving facility matures in March 2019, but is renewable upon mutual agreement with the lender, and accrues interest at BBSY plus 2.0% per annum (3.90% at September 30, 2018). At September 30, 2018, the revolver had an outstanding balance of AUD 11,000 ($7,951 at September 30, 2018). The revolver and the term loan are both secured by substantially all of the assets of Griffon Australia and its subsidiaries. Griffon guarantees the term loan. Griffon Australia is required to maintain a certain minimum equity level and is subject to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charges cover ratio.\nA UK subsidiary of Griffon maintained an invoice discounting arrangement secured by trade receivables. Interest was variable at 2.0% over the Sterling base rate. This facility was canceled in July 2018.\nIn July 2018, the AMES Companies UK Ltd and its subsidiaries (\"Ames UK\") entered into a GBP 14,000 term loan, GBP 4,000 mortgage loan and GBP 5,000 revolver. The term loan and mortgage loan require quarterly principal payments of GBP 350 and GBP 83 plus interest, respectively, and have balloon payments due upon maturity, in July 2023, of GBP 7,000 and GBP 2,333, respectively. The Term Loan and Mortgage Loans accrue interest at the GBP LIBOR Rate plus 2.25% and 1.8%, respectively (3.05% and 2.60% at September 30, 2018, respectively). The revolving facility matures in July 2019, but is renewable upon mutual agreement with the lender, and accrues interest at the Bank of England Base Rate plus 1.5% (2.25% as of September 30, 2018). The revolver and the term loan are both secured by substantially all of the assets of Ames UK and its subsidiaries. Ames UK is subject to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charges cover ratio. The invoice discounting arrangement was canceled and replaced by the above loan facilities. As of September 30, 2018, outstanding borrowings on these facilities totaled $23,987.\nOther long-term debt primarily consists of a loan with the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority, with the balance consisting of capital leases.\nAt September 30, 2018, Griffon and its subsidiaries were in compliance with the terms and covenants of its credit and loan agreements. Net Debt to EBITDA (Leverage), as calculated in accordance with the definition in the Credit Agreement, was 5.5x at September 30, 2018.\nOn each of August 3, 2016 and August 1, 2018, Griffon's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50,000 of Griffon's outstanding common stock. Under these share repurchase programs, the Company may purchase shares in the open market, including pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan, or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2018, Griffon purchased 2,088,739 shares of common stock under these repurchase programs, for a total of $41,110 or $19.68 per share. At September 30, 2018, $58,327 remains under Board repurchase authorizations.\nOn December 10, 2013 Griffon repurchased 4,444,444 shares of common stock from GS Direct in a private transaction at a per share price of $11.25, an approximate 9.2% discount to the stock's closing price on November 12, 2013, the day before announcement of the transaction. On June 19, 2018, GS Direct completed an underwritten secondary offering to sell 5,583,375 shares of Griffon's common stock, inclusive of the underwriters' 30-day option to purchase additional shares. Following the closing of the offering, GS Direct no longer owns any shares of Griffon. GS Direct's initial 10,000,000 share investment was in 2008.\nIn addition to the repurchases under Board authorized programs, during 2018, 199,978 shares, with a market value of $4,495, or $22.48 per share, were withheld to settle employee taxes due upon the vesting of restricted stock.\nDuring 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company declared and paid dividends totaling $0.28 per share, $0.24 per share and $0.20 per share, respectively. In addition, on March 7, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share paid on April 16, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 29, 2018. The Company currently intends to pay\ndividends each quarter; however, payment of dividends is determined by the Board of Directors at its discretion based on various factors, and no assurance can be provided as to the payment of future dividends.\nOn November 14, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.0725 per share, payable on December 20, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 29, 2018.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, Griffon used cash for discontinued operations from operating, investing and financing activities of $78,927, primarily related to PPC operations and the settling of certain Installation Services and environmental liabilities. Cash flows from investing activities of discontinued operations of $10,762 related primarily to capital expenditures.\nContractual Obligations\nAt September 30, 2018, payments to be made pursuant to significant contractual obligations are as follows:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,134,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,017,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>291,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental commitments\n</td> <td>104,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (b)\n</td> <td>233,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>2,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supplemental & post-retirement benefits (c)\n</td> <td>14,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uncertain tax positions (d)\n</td> <td>1,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,781,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>334,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>271,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,154,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Included in long-term debt are capital leases of: $3,759 (less than 1 year), $5,547 (1-3 years), $468 (3-5 years) and $0 (more than 5 years).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Purchase obligations are generally for the purchase of goods and services in the ordinary course of business.

These agreements promote investment in the country, and may be satisfied through activities that do not require Griffon to use its cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support. These agreements may also be satisfied through the use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, setting up support centers, research and development investments, acquisitions, and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations, if applicable. The amount of the offset requirement is determined by contract value awarded and negotiated percentages with customers. At September 30, 2018, Telephonics had outstanding offset agreements approximating $40,000, primarily related to its Radar Systems division, some of which extend through 2029. Offset programs usually extend over several years and in some cases provide for penalties in the event Telephonics fails to perform in accordance with contract requirements. Historically, Telephonics has not been required to pay any such penalties and as of September 30, 2018, no such penalties are estimable or probable.\nACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of Griffon's consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in public disclosures of Griffon, including information regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions, and form the basis for estimating the carrying values of assets and liabilities, as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment for commitments and contingencies. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates.\nAn estimate is considered to be critical if it is subjective and if changes in the estimate using different assumptions would result in a material impact on Griffon's financial position or results of operations. The following have been identified as the most critical accounting policies and estimates:\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when the following circumstances are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) delivery has occurred, title has transferred or services are rendered, c) price is fixed and determinable and d) collectability is reasonably assured. Goods are sold on terms that transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location. Revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met, including transfer of title and risk of loss, which occurs either upon shipment or upon receipt by customers at the location specified in the terms of sale. Other than standard product warranty provisions, sales arrangements provide for no other significant post-shipment obligations. From time to time and for certain customers, rebates and other sales incentives, promotional allowances or discounts are offered, typically related to customer purchase volumes, all of which are fixed or determinable and are classified as a reduction of revenue and recorded at the time of sale. Griffon provides for sales returns allowances based upon historical returns experience.\nTelephonics earns a substantial portion of its revenue as either a prime or subcontractor from contract awards with the U.S. Government, as well as non-U.S. governments and other commercial customers. These formal contracts are typically long-term in nature, usually greater than one year. Revenue and profits from these long-term fixed price contracts are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Revenue and profits on fixed-price contracts that contain engineering as well as production requirements are recorded based on the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to the total estimated costs for each contract (cost-to-cost method). Using the cost-to-cost method, revenue is recorded at amounts equal to the ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred divided by total estimated costs at completion, multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue, less the cumulative revenue recognized in prior periods. The profit recorded on a contract using this method is equal to the current estimated total profit margin multiplied by the cumulative revenue recognized, less the amount of cumulative profit previously recorded for the contract in prior periods. As this method relies on the substantial use of estimates, these projections may be revised throughout the life of a contract. Components of this formula and ratio that may be estimated include gross profit margin and total costs at\ncompletion. The cost performance and estimates to complete on long-term contracts are reviewed, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis, as well as when information becomes available that would necessitate a review of the current estimate. Adjustments to estimates for a contract's estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss often are required as experience is gained, and as more information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may or may not change, or if contract modifications occur. The impact of such adjustments or changes to estimates is made on a cumulative basis in the period when such information has become known. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, income from operations included net favorable/(unfavorable) catch-up adjustments approximating $1,400, $600 and $(700), respectively. Gross profit is affected by a variety of factors, including the mix of products, systems and services, production efficiencies, price competition and general economic conditions.\nRevenue and profits on cost-reimbursable type contracts recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract at an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the estimated profit on those costs. The estimated profit on a cost-reimbursable contract may be fixed or variable based on the contractual fee arrangement. Incentive and award fees on these contracts are recorded as revenue when the criteria under which they are earned are reasonably assured of being met and can be estimated.\nFor contracts whose anticipated total costs exceed total expected revenue, an estimated loss is recognized in the period when identifiable. A provision for the entire amount of the estimated loss is recorded on a cumulative basis. The estimated remaining costs to complete loss contracts, as of September 30, 2018 was $12,200 and is recorded as a reduction to gross margin on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). This loss had an immaterial impact to Griffon's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAmounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in revenue only when the amount can be reliably estimated and realization of the amount is probable, and are determined on a percentage-of-completion basis measured by the cost-to-cost method.\nFrom time to time, Telephonics may combine contracts if they are negotiated together, have specific requirements to combine, or are otherwise closely related. Contracts are segmented based on customer requirements.\nInventories\nInventories, stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out or average) or market, include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs.\nGriffon's businesses typically do not require inventory that is susceptible to becoming obsolete or dated. In general, Telephonics sells products in connection with programs authorized and approved under contracts awarded by the U.S. Government or agencies thereof, and in accordance with customer specifications. HBP produces doors, long-handled tools and landscaping products, and storage and organizational products in response to orders from customers of retailers and dealers or based on expected orders, as applicable.\nWarranty Accruals\nDirect customer and end-user warranties are provided on certain products. These warranties cover manufacturing defects that would prevent the product from performing in line with its intended and marketed use. The terms of such warranties vary by product line and generally provide for the repair or replacement of the defective product. Warranty claims data is collected and analyzed with a focus on the historical amount of claims, the products involved, the amount of time between the warranty claims and the products' respective sales and the amount of current sales. Based on such analysis, warranty accruals are recorded as an increase to cost of sales and regularly reviewed for adequacy.\nStock-based Compensation\nGriffon has issued stock-based compensation to certain employees, officers and directors in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units.\nCompensation expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units is recognized ratably over the required service period based on the fair value of the grant, calculated as the number of shares or units granted multiplied by the stock price on the date of grant, and for performance shares or units, the likelihood of achieving the performance criteria. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.\nAllowances for Discount, Doubtful Account and Returns\nTrade receivables are recorded at their stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. The allowances represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations (usually due to customers' potential insolvency), discounts related to early payment of accounts receivables by customers and estimates for returns. The allowance for doubtful accounts includes amounts for certain customers in which a risk of default has been specifically identified, as well as an amount for customer defaults, based on a formula, when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. Allowance for discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue and the provision related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in SG&A expenses.\nAcquisitions\nAcquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date and that the fair value of acquired in-process research and development be recorded on the balance sheet. Related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the purchase price over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nGoodwill, Long-Lived Intangible and Tangible Assets, and Impairment\nGriffon has significant intangible and tangible long-lived assets on its balance sheet that includes goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. As required under GAAP, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment annually, for Griffon as of September 30, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, using discounted future cash flows for each reporting unit. The testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment involves significant use of judgment and assumptions in the determination of a reporting unit's fair market value. Based upon the results of the annual impairment review, it was determined that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value of the assets, and no impairment existed as of September 30, 2018.\nLong-lived amortizable intangible assets, such as customer relationships and software, and tangible assets, primarily Property, plant and equipment, are amortized over their expected useful lives, which involve significant assumptions and estimates. Long-lived intangible and tangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset when an impairment indicator, such as change in business, customer loss or obsolete technology, exists.\nFair value estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Any changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects, which may result from a decline in Griffon's stock price, a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of Griffon's control, or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of Griffon's reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.\nRestructuring Reserves\nFrom time to time, Griffon will establish restructuring reserves at an operation. These reserves, for both termination and other exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though Griffon believes the estimates made are reasonable, they could differ materially from the actual costs.\nIncome Taxes\nGriffon's effective tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which Griffon operates. For interim financial reporting, the annual tax rate is estimated based on projected taxable income for the full year, and a quarterly income tax provision is recorded in accordance with the anticipated annual rate. As the year progresses, the annual tax rate is refined as new information becomes available, including year-to-date financial results. This process often results in changes to the effective tax rate throughout the year. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which a tax benefit has been recorded in the income statement. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should\nbe established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses; a forecast of future profitability; the duration of statutory carryback and carryforward periods; the Company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and tax planning alternatives. The likelihood that the deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income is assessed at least quarterly, and the valuation allowance, if any, is adjusted accordingly.\nTax benefits are recognized for an uncertain tax position when, in management's judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount that is judged to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized in the period in which they are identified. The effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which Griffon has recorded a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, Griffon believes its liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate. Favorable resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in Griffon's tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit could increase the tax provision and effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as non-current. However, if it is anticipated that a cash settlement will occur within one year, that portion of the liability is presented as current. Interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded as income tax expense.\nPension Benefits\nGriffon sponsors defined and supplemental benefit pension plans for certain active and retired employees. Annual amounts relating to these plans are recorded based on actuarial projections, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases and turnover rates. The actuarial assumptions used to determine pension liabilities, assets and expense are reviewed annually and modified based on current economic conditions and trends. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the nature of the plans' investments and expectations for long-term rates of return. The discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a corporate bond spot-rate yield curve that matches projected future benefit payments, with the appropriate spot rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit payments. Assumptions used in determining Griffon's obligations under the defined benefit pension plans are believed to be reasonable, based on experience and advice from independent actuaries; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect Griffon's financial position or results of operations.\nAll of the defined benefit plans are frozen and have ceased accruing benefits.\nNewly issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued guidance on changes to the disclosure requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which eliminates, amends, and adds disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The amended and new disclosure requirements primarily relate to Level 3 fair value measurements. The removal and amendment of certain disclosures may be early adopted with retrospective application while the new disclosure requirements are to be applied prospectively. The guidance is effective for the Company in fiscal 2021.We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued guidance on changes to the disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans, which makes minor changes to the disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans. The guidance requires a retrospective transition approach and is effective for the Company in fiscal 2022. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued guidance related to customer's accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. The guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). The guidance permits either a prospective or retrospective transition approach and is effective for the Company in fiscal 2021. We are currently evaluating\nthe impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which permits entities to reclassify, to retained earnings, the one-time income tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) arising from the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. An entity that elects to make this reclassification must consider all items in AOCI that have tax effects stranded as a result of the tax rate change, and must disclose the reclassification of these tax effects as well as the entity's policy for releasing income tax effects from AOCI. This guidance may be applied either retrospectively or as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued guidance to address the situation when a company modifies the terms of a stock compensation award previously granted to an employee. This guidance is effective, and should be applied prospectively, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued amendments to the Compensation - Retirement Benefits guidance which requires companies to retrospectively present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and retiree medical plans along with other compensation costs in operating income and present the other components of net periodic benefit cost below operating income in the income statement. The guidance also allows only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization within inventory or fixed assets on a prospective basis. This guidance is effective, and should be applied retroactively, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those periods and will be effective for the Company beginning in 2020. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies the definition of a business, which will impact many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The new standard is intended to help companies and other organizations evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods and will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued guidance on the Statement of Cash Flows Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). This guidance addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This guidance will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not believe this will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on lease accounting requiring lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for long-term leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. This guidance must be applied\nusing a modified retrospective transition approach to all annual and interim periods presented and is effective for the company beginning in fiscal 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update related to new revenue recognition guidance that supersedes the existing revenue recognition guidance and most industry-specific guidance applicable to revenue recognition. According to the new guidance, an entity will apply a principles-based five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The core principle of the guidance is that the recognition of revenue should depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The converged standard also includes more robust disclosure requirements which will require entities to provide sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Subsequently, the FASB has issued amendments to certain aspects of the guidance including the effective date. The effective date of this revised standard is for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The converged standard can be adopted using a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective method, which applies the new guidance to contracts that are not completed at the adoption date without adjusting prior reporting periods. The Company has completed its assessment of the impact of this standard which will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of its 2019 fiscal year and will adopt this guidance using the modified retrospective method.\nBeginning in the second half of fiscal 2016, the Company assembled a team to analyze the impact of the standard, and the related guidance issued, across all revenue streams and to evaluate the impact of the new standard on revenue contracts. This team reviewed current accounting policies and practices, identifying potential differences that would result from applying the requirements under the new standard. As noted above, the Company will adopt this new standard in the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. The standard will not impact revenue recognition practices at the Company's Home and Building Products Segment, but will have an impact at its Defense Electronics Segment. The Company will adopt the new standard by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. We expect this adjustment to opening retained earnings to be approximately $5,000 with an immaterial impact to our net income on an ongoing basis.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to the SEC SAB 118. This ASU provides guidance on income tax accounting implications under the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" (\"TCJA\"). SAB 118 addressed the application of GAAP to situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared and analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA and allows companies to record provisional amounts during the re-measurement period not to exceed one year after the enactment date while the accounting impact remains under analysis. This guidance was effective immediately upon issuance. See Note 11 Income Taxes for further details.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance on Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as the classification of related matters in the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for annual periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 using either prospective, retrospective or modified retrospective transition method, depending on the area covered in this update. The Company early adopted this guidance for fiscal 2016 in order to simplify the accounting for employee share-based payments.\nUnder this guidance all excess tax benefits ( windfalls\u201d) and deficiencies ( shortfalls\u201d) related to employee stock compensation was recognized within income tax expense for the year ended September 30, 2016. Under prior guidance, windfalls were recognized to Capital in excess of par value and shortfalls were only recognized to the extent they exceed the pool of windfall tax benefits. As a result of the adoption, a tax benefit of $2,193 was recognized within income tax expense reflecting the excess tax benefits for the year ended September 30, 2016. The adoption was on a prospective basis and therefore had no impact on prior years. Additionally, income tax benefits at settlement of an award were previously reported as a reduction to operating cash flows and an increase to financing cash flows to the extent that those benefits exceeded the income tax benefits reported in earnings during the award's vesting period. Griffon has elected to apply that change in cash flow classification on a prospective basis, which has resulted in a $2,291 increase to net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding decrease to net cash used in financing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the amounts previously reported. The remaining provisions of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued guidance on simplifying the presentation of deferred income taxes, requiring deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be classified as non-current in the statement of financial position. The guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and may be applied retrospectively or prospectively. The Company early adopted this guidance in fiscal 2016 in order to simplify balance sheet presentation and applied it retrospectively for all periods presented in the financial statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued guidance on management's responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern and related footnote disclosures. Management is required to evaluate, at each reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. This guidance was effective prospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning in 2017; implementation of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "On July 31, 2017, The AMES Companies, Inc. acquired La Hacienda Limited, a leading United Kingdom outdoor living brand of unique heating and garden decor products, for approximately $11,400 (GBP 9,175). The acquisition of La Hacienda broadens AMES' global outdoor living and lawn and garden business and supports AMES' UK expansion strategy. La Hacienda, as expected, generated approximately GBP 14,000 of revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusting items, net of tax:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs\n</td> <td>5,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract settlement charges\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special dividend ESOP charges\n</td> <td>2,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secondary equity offering costs\n</td> <td>795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of life insurance benefit\n</td> <td>248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discrete and other certain tax benefits\n</td> <td>(9,384\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,274\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(857\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per common share from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusting items, net of tax:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs\n</td> <td>0.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract settlement charges\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special dividend ESOP charges\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secondary equity offering costs\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of life insurance benefit\n</td> <td>0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discrete and other certain tax benefits\n</td> <td>(0.22\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.02\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average shares outstanding (in thousands)\n</td> <td>42,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nfor commercial, industrial, institutional, and retail use.

On October 2, 2017, Griffon completed an add-on offering of $275,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2022 in an unregistered offering through a private placement. The $275,000 senior notes were issued under the same indenture pursuant to which Griffon previously issued $725,000 in aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% Senior Notes due 2022. The proceeds were used to purchase ClosetMaid and reduce the outstanding balance of Griffon's revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Agreement\")). At September 30, 2018, there were $25,000 in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, compared to $144,216 in outstanding borrowings at the same date in the prior year.\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and Equivalents and Debt\n</td> <td>At September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payables and current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td>13,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, net of current maturities\n</td> <td>1,108,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>968,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt discount and issuance costs\n</td> <td>13,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt\n</td> <td>1,134,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>992,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt, net of cash and equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,064,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>944,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared to 2016\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flows from Continuing Operations\n</td> <td>Years Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Cash Flows Provided By (Used In):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(5,680\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71,337\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>39,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(700\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGriffon has significant intangible and tangible long-lived assets on its balance sheet that includes goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. As required under GAAP, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment annually, for Griffon as of September 30, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, using discounted future cash flows for each reporting unit. The testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment involves significant use of judgment and assumptions in the determination of a reporting unit's fair market value. Based upon the results of the annual impairment review, it was determined that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value of the assets, and no impairment existed as of September 30, 2018.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AMES\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>953,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>545,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>513,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CBP\n</td> <td>697,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>568,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>527,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home & Building Products\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,651,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,113,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,041,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>44,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition costs\n</td> <td>2,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>126,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(AUD 22,250).

After taking into account the net of the estimated present value of tax benefits resulting from the transaction, the effective purchase price is approximately $170,000. The acquisition of CornellCookson substantially expanded CBP's non-residential product offerings, and added an established professional dealer network focused on rolling steel door and grille products for commercial, industrial, institutional and retail use. CornellCookson is expected to generate approximately $200,000 in revenue in the first full year of operations.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Segment operating profit to Income before taxes from continuing operations:\nOn October 2, 2017, in an unregistered offering through a private placement under Rule 144A, Griffon completed the add-on offering of $275,000 principal amount of its 5.25% senior notes due 2022, at 101.0% of par, to Griffon's previously issued $125,000 principal amount of its 5.25% senior notes due 2022, at 98.76% of par, completed on May 18, 2016 and $600,000 5.25% senior notes due in 2022, at par, which was completed on February 27, 2014 (collectively the Senior Notes\u201d). As of September 30, 2018, outstanding Senior Notes due totaled $1,000,000; interest is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1. The net proceeds of the $275,000 add-on offering were used to acquire ClosetMaid, with the remaining proceeds used to pay down outstanding loan borrowings under Griffon's Revolving Credit Facility (the \"Credit Agreement\"). The net proceeds of the previously issued $125,000 add-on offering were used to pay down outstanding revolving loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nIn September 2015 and March 2016, Griffon entered into mortgage loans in the amount of $32,280 and $8,000, respectively, and were due to mature in September 2025 and April 2018, respectively. The mortgage loans were secured and collateralized by four properties occupied by Griffon's subsidiaries and were guaranteed by Griffon. The loans had an interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.50%. The loans were paid off during the year ended September 30, 2018.\nRevenue in 2018 decreased $85,390, or 21%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreased maritime surveillance radar and electronic countermeasure systems revenue.\nGRIFFON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nInventories\n2017 Compared to 2016\nFor 2017, unallocated amounts, which consist primarily of corporate overhead costs, totaled $42,398 compared to $40,393 in 2016, with the increase primarily due to compensation and incentive costs.\nNo other customer exceeded 10% or more of consolidated revenue. Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon's largest customers and our relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to change and may fluctuate materially. The loss of all or a portion of volume from any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on Griffon's liquidity and operations.\nGriffon sponsors defined and supplemental benefit pension plans for certain active and retired employees. Annual amounts relating to these plans are recorded based on actuarial projections, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases and turnover rates. The actuarial assumptions used to determine pension liabilities, assets and expense are reviewed annually and modified based on current economic conditions and trends. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the nature of the plans' investments and expectations for long-term rates of return. The discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a corporate bond spot-rate yield curve that matches projected future benefit payments, with the appropriate spot rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit payments. Assumptions used in determining Griffon's obligations under the defined benefit pension plans are believed to be reasonable, based on experience and advice from independent actuaries; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect Griffon's financial position or results of operations.\n (d) Due to the uncertainty of the potential settlement of future uncertain tax positions, management is unable to estimate the timing of related payments, if any, that will be made subsequent to 2018. These amounts do not include any potential indirect benefits resulting from deductions or credits for payments made to other jurisdictions. \nA small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon's consolidated revenue. In 2018:\nSegment operating profit decreased $4,681 from the prior year primarily due to the decreased revenue noted above and the impact of revised estimates to complete remaining performance obligations on certain airborne intercommunications systems. The prior year included a $5,137 contract settlement charge.\nAt September 30, 2018, Griffon and its subsidiaries were in compliance with the terms and covenants of its credit and loan agreements. Net Debt to EBITDA (Leverage), as calculated in accordance with the definition in the Credit Agreement, was 5.5x at September 30, 2018.\n\nGriffon reported pretax income from continuing operations of $33,810 for the year ended September 30, 2018 compared to $16,698 for the prior year. In 2018, the Company recognized a tax provision of 1.6% compared to 6.5% in 2017. The 2018 tax rate included $9,384 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, primarily from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and the provisional amount recorded for the IRC section 965 transition tax on the untaxed foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits, related to the TCJA. The 2017 tax rate included $8,274 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, related primarily to excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense, a federal domestic production activities deduction and a federal R&D credit.\nIn August 2016, Griffon's ESOP entered into an agreement that refinanced the existing ESOP loan into a new Term Loan in the amount of $35,092 (the \"Agreement\"). The Agreement also provided for a Line Note with $10,908 available to purchase shares of Griffon common stock in the open market. During 2017, Griffon's ESOP purchased 621,875 shares of common stock for a total of $10,908 or $17.54 per share, under a borrowing line that has now been fully utilized. On June 30, 2017, the Term Loan and Line Note were combined into a single Term Loan. The Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.0%. The Term Loan requires quarterly principal payments of $569 with a balloon payment due at maturity on March 22, 2020. As a result of the special cash dividend of $1.00 per share, paid on April 16, 2018, the outstanding balance of the Term Loan was reduced by $5,705. As of September 30, 2018, $34,508, net of issuance costs, was outstanding under the Term Loan. The Term Loan is secured by shares purchased with the proceeds of the loan and with a lien on a specific amount of Griffon assets (which lien ranks pari passu with the lien granted on such assets under the Credit Agreement) and is guaranteed by Griffon.\nAcquisitions\nHeadquartered in New York, N.Y., the Company was founded in 1959 and is incorporated in Delaware. Griffon is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol GFF.\n- Discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $8,274, or $0.19 per share.\nOn each of August 3, 2016 and August 1, 2018, Griffon's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50,000 of Griffon's outstanding common stock. Under these share repurchase programs, the Company may purchase shares in the open market, including pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan, or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2018, Griffon purchased 2,088,739 shares of common stock under these repurchase programs, for a total of $41,110 or $19.68 per share. At September 30, 2018, $58,327 remains under Board repurchase authorizations.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued guidance on simplifying the presentation of deferred income taxes, requiring deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be classified as non-current in the statement of financial position. The guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and may be applied retrospectively or prospectively. The Company early adopted this guidance in fiscal 2016 in order to simplify balance sheet presentation and applied it retrospectively for all periods presented in the financial statements.\nOn June 4, 2018, Clopay Building Products Company, Inc. (\"CBP\") acquired CornellCookson, Inc. (\"CornellCookson\"), a leading US manufacturer and marketer of rolling steel door and grille products designed for commercial, industrial, institutional and retail use, for $180,000, excluding certain post-closing adjustments. After taking into account the estimated present value of tax benefits resulting from the transaction, the effective purchase price is approximately $170,000. CornellCookson is expected to generate approximately $200,000 in revenue in the first full year of operations. The accounts, affected for preliminary adjustments to reflect fair market values assigned to assets purchased and liabilities assumed, and results of operations of CornellCookson, are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition of June 4, 2018. See Note 2, Acquisitions.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nAmounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in revenue only when the amount can be reliably estimated and realization of the amount is probable, and are determined on a percentage-of-completion basis measured by the cost-to-cost method.\nCash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2018 was $66,446 compared to $49,151 in 2017. Cash provided by income from continuing operations, adjusted for non-cash expenditures, was offset by a net increase in working capital, primarily from increased inventory. 2018 included $14,821 of cash expenditures related to items that affect comparability, primarily related to acquisition diligence compared to $1,318 in 2017.\nInstallation Services and Other Discontinued Activities\nPrior year acquisitions\n\nStock-based Compensation\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIncome Taxes\nThe 2017 results included the following from continuing operations:\nFor contracts whose anticipated total costs exceed total expected revenue, an estimated loss is recognized in the period when identifiable. A provision for the entire amount of the estimated loss is recorded on a cumulative basis. The estimated remaining costs to complete loss contracts, as of September 30, 2018 was $12,200 and is recorded as a reduction to gross margin on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). This loss had an immaterial impact to Griffon's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGriffon Corporation (the Company\u201d or Griffon\u201d) is a diversified management and holding company that conducts business through wholly-owned subsidiaries. Griffon oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among them and manages their capital structures. Griffon provides direction and assistance to its subsidiaries in connection with acquisition and growth opportunities as well as in connection with divestitures. In order to further diversify, Griffon also seeks out, evaluates and, when appropriate, will acquire additional businesses that offer potentially attractive returns on capital.\nOff-Set Agreements\n- Discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $9,384 or $0.22 per share, primarily from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and the provisional amount recorded for the IRC section 965 transition tax on the untaxed foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits related to the TCJA.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued guidance related to customer's accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. The guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). The guidance permits either a prospective or retrospective transition approach and is effective for the Company in fiscal 2021. We are currently evaluating\nGriffon currently conducts its continuing operations through two reportable segments:\nOVERVIEW\nExcluding the discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, and certain other items from continuing operations, as listed below, the effective tax rates for the year ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were 33.8% and 39.7%, respectively. These rates reflect the impact of tax reserves and changes in earnings mix between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\n(Unless otherwise indicated, all references to years or year-end refers to the fiscal year ending September 30 and dollars are in thousands, except per share data)\nExcluding these items from both reporting periods, 2018 Income from continuing operations would have been $32,086, or $0.76 per share compared to $18,954, or $0.44 per share, in 2017.\n\nOn October 2, 2017, Griffon completed the acquisition of ClosetMaid, a market leader of home storage and organization products, for approximately $185,700, inclusive of post-closing adjustments, or $165,000 net of the estimated present value of tax benefits resulting from the transaction. ClosetMaid adds to Griffon's Home and Building Products segment, complementing and diversifying Griffon's portfolio of leading consumer brands and products. ClosetMaid, as expected, generated over $300,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nTax benefits are recognized for an uncertain tax position when, in management's judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount that is judged to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized in the period in which they are identified. The effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which Griffon has recorded a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, Griffon believes its liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate. Favorable resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in Griffon's tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit could increase the tax provision and effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as non-current. However, if it is anticipated that a cash settlement will occur within one year, that portion of the liability is presented as current. Interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded as income tax expense.\nThe 2016 results included discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $857 or $0.02 per share from continuing operations.\nInterest expense from continuing operations in 2017 of $51,513 increased 3% compared to the prior year of $49,943 primarily as a result of increased debt levels related to the May 2016 add-on offering of $125,000 of 5.25% senior notes due 2022 and higher outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility.\n - Acquisition costs of $9,617 ($6,145, net of tax, or $0.14 per share); \nIn May 2017, the FASB issued guidance to address the situation when a company modifies the terms of a stock compensation award previously granted to an employee. This guidance is effective, and should be applied prospectively, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn addition to the repurchases under Board authorized programs, during 2018, 199,978 shares, with a market value of $4,495, or $22.48 per share, were withheld to settle employee taxes due upon the vesting of restricted stock.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued guidance on management's responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern and related footnote disclosures. Management is required to evaluate, at each reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. This guidance was effective prospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning in 2017; implementation of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\n- Acquisition costs of $7,597 ($5,047, net of tax, or $0.12 per share);\n \u2022 Defense Electronics segment consists of Telephonics Corporation (\"Telephonics\"), founded in 1933, a globally recognized leading provider of highly sophisticated intelligence, surveillance and communications solutions for defense, aerospace and commercial customers. Telephonics' revenue was 17%, 27% and 29% of Griffon's consolidated revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n\nIn August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued guidance on the Statement of Cash Flows Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). This guidance addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This guidance will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not believe this will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nDuring 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company declared and paid dividends totaling $0.28 per share, $0.24 per share and $0.20 per share, respectively. In addition, on March 7, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share paid on April 16, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 29, 2018. The Company currently intends to pay\nGriffon reported pretax income from continuing operations of $16,698 for the year ended September 30, 2017 compared to $32,213 for the prior year. In 2017, the Company recognized a tax benefit of 6.5% compared to a tax provision of 38.6% in 2016. The 2017 tax rate included $8,274 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, related primarily to excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense, a federal domestic production activities deduction and a federal R&D credit. The 2016 tax rate included an $857 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, related primarily to excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense and the release of unrecognized tax benefits.\nOn December 30, 2016, AMES Australia acquired Home Living (\"Hills\") for approximately $6,051 (AUD 8,400). Hills, founded in 1946, is a market leader in the supply of clothesline, laundry and garden products. The Hills acquisition adds to AMES' existing broad category of products and enhances its lawn and garden product offerings in Australia. Hills, as expected, generated approximately AUD 10,000 of revenue in the first twelve months after acquisition.\nPayments related to Telephonics revenue are received in accordance with the terms of development and production subcontracts; certain of such receipts are progress or performance based payments. With respect to HBP, uncollected receivables have been immaterial in amount.\nDuring 2018, Telephonics was awarded new contracts and incremental funding on existing contracts approximating $320,300. Contract backlog was $344,900 at September 30, 2018 with 69% expected to be fulfilled in the next 12 months; backlog was $350,900 at September 30, 2017. Backlog is defined as unfilled firm orders for products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer or Congress, in the case of the U.S. government agencies. The decrease in backlog was primarily due to the timing of various U.S. and international contract awards associated with radar and surveillance opportunities.\nSegment operating profit in 2018 was $130,487 compared to $89,495 in 2017, an increase of $40,992, or 46%. Excluding the impact of acquisition related costs, Segment operating profit would have been $132,867 in the current year and $90,219 in the prior year, increasing 47% from the prior year, primarily driven by the increased revenue as noted above, partially offset by increased steel and resin costs, and tariffs. Segment depreciation and amortization increased $7,986 from the prior year primarily from acquisitions.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nREPORTABLE SEGMENTS\n2018 Compared to 2017\nRECONCILIATION OF INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn 2018, capital expenditures, net, totaled $49,475 compared to $34,794 in 2017.\ndividends each quarter; however, payment of dividends is determined by the Board of Directors at its discretion based on various factors, and no assurance can be provided as to the payment of future dividends.\nIn November 2012, Garant G.P. ( Garant\u201d) entered into a CAD 15,000 ($11,498 as of September 30, 2018) revolving credit facility. The facility accrues interest at LIBOR (USD) or the Bankers Acceptance Rate (CDN) plus 1.3% per annum (3.70% LIBOR USD and 3.24% Bankers Acceptance Rate (CDN) as of September 30, 2018). The revolving facility matures in October 2019. Garant is required to maintain a certain minimum equity. As of September 30, 2018, there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility with CAD 15,000 ($11,498 as of September 30, 2018) available for borrowing.\nIn July 2016, Griffon Australia Holdings Pty Ltd and its Australian subsidiaries (\"Griffon Australia\") entered into an AUD 30,000 term loan and an AUD 10,000 revolver. The term loan refinanced two existing term loans and the revolver replaced two existing lines. In December 2016, the amount available under the revolver was increased from AUD 10,000 to AUD 20,000 and, in March 2017 the term loan commitment was increased by AUD 5,000. In September 2017, the term commitment was increased by AUD 15,000. The term loan requires quarterly principal payments of AUD 1,250 plus interest with a balloon payment of AUD 37,125 due upon maturity in October 2019, and accrues interest at Bank Bill Swap Bid Rate BBSY\u201d plus 2.00% per annum (3.99% at September 30, 2018). As of September 30, 2018, the term had an outstanding balance of AUD 40,875 ($29,546 as of September 30, 2018). The revolving facility matures in March 2019, but is renewable upon mutual agreement with the lender, and accrues interest at BBSY plus 2.0% per annum (3.90% at September 30, 2018). At September 30, 2018, the revolver had an outstanding balance of AUD 11,000 ($7,951 at September 30, 2018). The revolver and the term loan are both secured by substantially all of the assets of Griffon Australia and its subsidiaries. Griffon guarantees the term loan. Griffon Australia is required to maintain a certain minimum equity level and is subject to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charges cover ratio.\nOther income (expense) from continuing operations of $1,231 in 2018 and $(880) in 2017 consists primarily of currency exchange transaction gains and losses from receivables and payables held in non-functional currencies, and net gains on investments.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which a tax benefit has been recorded in the income statement. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should\nOn March 22, 2016, Griffon amended its Credit Agreement to increase the credit facility from $250,000 to $350,000, extend its maturity from March 13, 2020 to March 22, 2021, and modify certain other provisions of the facility. On October 2, 2017 and on May 31, 2018, Griffon amended the Credit Agreement in connection with the ClosetMaid and the CornellCookson acquisitions, respectively, to modify the net leverage covenant. The facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility with a limit of $50,000 and a multi-currency sub-facility of $100,000. The Credit Agreement provides for same day borrowings of base rate loans. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and re-borrowed at any time, subject to final maturity of the facility or the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement. Interest is payable on borrowings at either a LIBOR or base rate benchmark rate, in each case without a floor, plus an applicable margin, which adjusts based on financial performance. Current margins are 1.75% for base rate loans and 2.75% for LIBOR loans. The Credit Agreement has certain financial maintenance tests including a maximum total leverage ratio, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants place limits on Griffon's ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, and make restricted payments and investments. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Griffon's material domestic subsidiaries and are secured, on a first priority basis, by substantially all domestic assets of the Company and the guarantors, and a pledge of not greater than 65% of the equity interest in Griffon's material, first-tier foreign subsidiaries (except that a lien on the assets of Griffon's material domestic subsidiaries securing a limited amount of the debt under the credit agreement relating to Griffon's Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") ranks pari passu with the lien granted on such assets under the Credit Agreement). At September 30, 2018, under the Credit Agreement, there were $25,000 outstanding borrowings; outstanding standby letters of credit were $14,623; and $310,377 was available, subject to certain loan covenants, for borrowing at that date.\nFor 2018, unallocated amounts, consisting primarily of corporate overhead costs, totaled $45,812 compared to $42,398 in 2017, with the increase primarily due to compensation, incentive and relocation costs.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses from continuing operations of $433,110 increased 28% from the prior year amount of $339,089, primarily due to the inclusion of $7,597 of acquisition related expenditures as well as incremental SG&A expenses associated with these acquisitions. SG&A for 2018, as a percent of revenue, was 21.9%, compared to 22.2% in the prior year.\nDuring 2018, total other comprehensive income, net of taxes, of $26,369 included a gain of $14,866 related to the removal of PPC's foreign currency translation loss, which is considered in the gain on the disposal of discontinued operations; a loss of $5,463 from foreign currency translation adjustments primarily due to the weakening of the Euro, Canadian, British and Australian currencies, all in comparison to the U.S. Dollar; a $16,381 gain from Pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily associated with a $10,053 SERP benefit related to the passing of our Chairman of the Board and higher assumed discount rates compared to the prior year; and a $585 gain on cash flow hedges.\nThe Company\nOn November 16, 2017, Griffon announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell PPC and on February 6, 2018, completed the sale to Berry for approximately $475,000. As a result, Griffon classified the results of operations of the PPC business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets. All results and information presented exclude PPC unless otherwise noted. PPC is a global leader in the development and production of embossed, laminated and printed specialty plastic films for hygienic, health-care and industrial products and sells to some of the world's largest consumer products companies.\nIn July 2018, the AMES Companies UK Ltd and its subsidiaries (\"Ames UK\") entered into a GBP 14,000 term loan, GBP 4,000 mortgage loan and GBP 5,000 revolver. The term loan and mortgage loan require quarterly principal payments of GBP 350 and GBP 83 plus interest, respectively, and have balloon payments due upon maturity, in July 2023, of GBP 7,000 and GBP 2,333, respectively. The Term Loan and Mortgage Loans accrue interest at the GBP LIBOR Rate plus 2.25% and 1.8%, respectively (3.05% and 2.60% at September 30, 2018, respectively). The revolving facility matures in July 2019, but is renewable upon mutual agreement with the lender, and accrues interest at the Bank of England Base Rate plus 1.5% (2.25% as of September 30, 2018). The revolver and the term loan are both secured by substantially all of the assets of Ames UK and its subsidiaries. Ames UK is subject to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charges cover ratio. The invoice discounting arrangement was canceled and replaced by the above loan facilities. As of September 30, 2018, outstanding borrowings on these facilities totaled $23,987.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update related to new revenue recognition guidance that supersedes the existing revenue recognition guidance and most industry-specific guidance applicable to revenue recognition. According to the new guidance, an entity will apply a principles-based five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The core principle of the guidance is that the recognition of revenue should depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The converged standard also includes more robust disclosure requirements which will require entities to provide sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Subsequently, the FASB has issued amendments to certain aspects of the guidance including the effective date. The effective date of this revised standard is for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The converged standard can be adopted using a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective method, which applies the new guidance to contracts that are not completed at the adoption date without adjusting prior reporting periods. The Company has completed its assessment of the impact of this standard which will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of its 2019 fiscal year and will adopt this guidance using the modified retrospective method.\nPension Benefits\nExcept for operating leases and purchase obligations as disclosed herein, Griffon is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nIncome from continuing operations was $17,783, or $0.41 per share, for 2017 compared to $19,781, or $0.45 per share in the prior year.\nSegment operating profit decreased $12,858 from the prior year period. During 2017, Telephonics recorded a $5,137 charge, consisting of a settlement in the amount of $4,250 plus 2% interest and associated legal costs, related to certain amounts the civil division of the US Department of Justice indicated it believed it was owed from Telephonics with respect to certain US government contracts, performed during the 2005 to 2013 time period, in which Telephonics acted as a subcontractor. Excluding these charges, segment operating profit in the current year would have been $35,080, a $7,721 decrease from the prior year period primarily due to the decreased revenue noted above, unfavorable program mix and the impact of revised estimates to complete remaining performance obligations on certain radar and communication programs.\n (a) Included in long-term debt are capital leases of: $3,759 (less than 1 year), $5,547 (1-3 years), $468 (3-5 years) and $0 (more than 5 years). \nAt September 30, 2018, Griffon's liabilities for PPC and Installations Services and other discontinued operations primarily related to insurance claims, income taxes and product liability, warranty and environmental reserves and stay and transaction bonuses totaling liabilities of approximately $9,858. See Note 6, Discontinued Operations.\nOther long-term debt primarily consists of a loan with the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority, with the balance consisting of capital leases.\nOn each of August 3, 2016 and August 1, 2018, Griffon's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50,000 of Griffon's outstanding common stock. Under these share repurchase programs, the Company may purchase shares in the open market, including pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan, or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2018, Griffon purchased 2,088,739 shares of common stock under these repurchase programs, for a total of $41,110 or $19.68 per share. At September 30, 2018, $58,327\nExcluding the discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, and certain other items from continuing operations, as listed below, the effective tax rates for the year ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were 39.7% and 41.3%, respectively. These rates reflect the impact of tax reserves and changes in earnings mix between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\nOther income (expense) from continuing operations of $(880) in 2017 and $(250) in 2016 consists primarily of currency exchange transaction gains and losses from receivables and payables held in non-functional currencies, and net gains on investments.\nAt September 30, 2018, Griffon had debt, net of cash and equivalents, as follows:\nOn November 16, 2017, Griffon announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell Clopay Plastic Products Company, Inc. (\"PPC\") and on February 6, 2018, completed the sale to Berry Global, Inc. (\"Berry\") for approximately $475,000. As a result, Griffon classified the results of operations of the PPC business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets. All results and information presented exclude PPC unless otherwise noted. See Note 6, Discontinued Operations.\nIncome from continuing operations was $33,255, or $0.78 per share, for 2018 compared to $17,783, or $0.41 per share in the prior year.\nOn February 13, 2018, AMES acquired Kelkay, a leading United Kingdom manufacturer and distributor of decorative outdoor landscaping products sold to garden centers, retailers and grocers in the UK and Ireland for approximately $56,118 (GBP 40,452), subject to contingent consideration of up to GBP 7,000. This acquisition broadened AMES' product offerings in the market and increased its in-country operational footprint. Kelkay is expected to contribute approximately $40,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nSegment depreciation and amortization of $55,334 in 2018 compared to the prior year of $47,398, increased $7,936 primarily due to depreciation and amortization on assets acquired in acquisitions.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance on Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as the classification of related matters in the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for annual periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 using either prospective, retrospective or modified retrospective transition method, depending on the area covered in this update. The Company early adopted this guidance for fiscal 2016 in order to simplify the accounting for employee share-based payments.\n\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued guidance on changes to the disclosure requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which eliminates, amends, and adds disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The amended and new disclosure requirements primarily relate to Level 3 fair value measurements. The removal and amendment of certain disclosures may be early adopted with retrospective application while the new disclosure requirements are to be applied prospectively. The guidance is effective for the Company in fiscal 2021.We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS\n a. The U.S. Government and its agencies, through prime and subcontractor relationships, represented 10% of Griffon's consolidated revenue and 62% of Telephonics' revenue. \nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements.\nClopay Plastics Products\nProceeds from the $600,000 5.25% senior notes due in 2022 were used to redeem $550,000 of 7.125% senior notes due 2018, to pay a call and tender offer premium of $31,530 and to make interest payments of $16,716, with the balance used to pay a portion of the related transaction fees and expenses. In connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes, all obligations under the $550,000 of 7.125% senior notes due in 2018 were discharged.\nGriffon substantially concluded remaining disposal activities in 2009. There was no reported revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016. During the year ended September 30, 2017, Griffon recorded $5,700 of reserves in discontinued operations related to historical environmental remediation efforts and to increase the reserve for homeowner association claims (HOA) related to installation services.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued amendments to the Compensation - Retirement Benefits guidance which requires companies to retrospectively present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and retiree medical plans along with other compensation costs in operating income and present the other components of net periodic benefit cost below operating income in the income statement. The guidance also allows only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization within inventory or fixed assets on a prospective basis. This guidance is effective, and should be applied retroactively, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nHome & Building Products\nUnder this guidance all excess tax benefits ( windfalls\u201d) and deficiencies ( shortfalls\u201d) related to employee stock compensation was recognized within income tax expense for the year ended September 30, 2016. Under prior guidance, windfalls were recognized to Capital in excess of par value and shortfalls were only recognized to the extent they exceed the pool of windfall tax benefits. As a result of the adoption, a tax benefit of $2,193 was recognized within income tax expense reflecting the excess tax benefits for the year ended September 30, 2016. The adoption was on a prospective basis and therefore had no impact on prior years. Additionally, income tax benefits at settlement of an award were previously reported as a reduction to operating cash flows and an increase to financing cash flows to the extent that those benefits exceeded the income tax benefits reported in earnings during the award's vesting period. Griffon has elected to apply that change in cash flow classification on a prospective basis, which has resulted in a $2,291 increase to net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding decrease to net cash used in financing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the amounts previously reported. The remaining provisions of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on the\nLong-lived amortizable intangible assets, such as customer relationships and software, and tangible assets, primarily Property, plant and equipment, are amortized over their expected useful lives, which involve significant assumptions and estimates. Long-lived intangible and tangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset when an impairment indicator, such as change in business, customer loss or obsolete technology, exists.\n (b) Purchase obligations are generally for the purchase of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Griffon uses blanket purchase orders to communicate expected requirements to certain vendors. Purchase obligations reflect those purchase orders in which the commitment is considered to be firm. Purchase obligations that extend beyond 2018 are principally related to long-term contracts received from customers of Telephonics. \nOn December 10, 2013 Griffon repurchased 4,444,444 shares of common stock from GS Direct in a private transaction at a per share price of $11.25, an approximate 9.2% discount to the stock's closing price on November 12, 2013, the day before announcement of the transaction. On June 19, 2018, GS Direct completed an underwritten secondary offering to sell 5,583,375 shares of Griffon's common stock, inclusive of the underwriters' 30-day option to purchase additional shares. Following the closing of the offering, GS Direct no longer owns any shares of Griffon. GS Direct's initial 10,000,000 share investment was in 2008.\n- Discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $8,274, or $0.19 per share.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nFrom time to time, Griffon will establish restructuring reserves at an operation. These reserves, for both termination and other exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though Griffon believes the estimates made are reasonable, they could differ materially from the actual costs.\nRevenue from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2018 was $1,977,918, compared to $1,524,997 in the prior year, an increase of 30%, primarily driven by increased revenue at Home & Building Products from both recent acquisitions and organic growth, partially offset by decreased revenue at Telephonics. Gross profit for 2018 was $529,560 compared to $408,116 in 2017, with gross margin as a percent of sales ( gross margin\u201d) of 26.8%, consistent with the prior year.\nGriffon's businesses typically do not require inventory that is susceptible to becoming obsolete or dated. In general, Telephonics sells products in connection with programs authorized and approved under contracts awarded by the U.S. Government or agencies thereof, and in accordance with customer specifications. HBP produces doors, long-handled tools and landscaping products, and storage and organizational products in response to orders from customers of retailers and dealers or based on expected orders, as applicable.\nTwo Griffon subsidiaries have capital leases outstanding for real estate located in Troy, Ohio and Ocala, Florida. The leases mature in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and bear interest at fixed rates of approximately 5.0% and 8.0%, respectively. The Troy, Ohio\nCritical Accounting Policies\nSegment operating profit in 2017 was $89,495 compared to $79,682 in 2016, an increase of $9,813, or 12%, driven by the increased revenue noted above and favorable product mix, partially offset by increased steel and resin costs. Segment depreciation and amortization increased $1,280 from the prior year period.\nGoodwill, Long-Lived Intangible and Tangible Assets, and Impairment\nAcquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date and that the fair value of acquired in-process research and development be recorded on the balance sheet. Related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the purchase price over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nSegment revenue increased $538,311, or 48%, compared to the prior year period due to the AMES' acquisitions of La Hacienda, Tuscan Path, ClosetMaid (\"CM\"), Harper and Kelkay, and CBP's acquisition of CornellCookson (\"CC\"), as well as increased favorable mix and price at CBP and AMES, and volume increases at CBP and AMES' non US locations, offset by AMES US decrease due to unfavorable weather. 2018 CM and CC revenue was $311,568 and $66,654, respectively. Organic growth was 7%.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, Griffon used cash for discontinued operations from operating, investing and financing activities of $78,927, primarily related to PPC operations and the settling of certain Installation Services and environmental liabilities. Cash flows from investing activities of discontinued operations of $10,762 related primarily to capital expenditures.\n\n - Acquisition costs of $9,617 ($6,145, net of tax, or $0.14 per share);  - Contract settlement charges of $5,137 ($3,300, net of tax, or $0.08 per share); and\n- Contract settlement charges of $5,137 ($3,300, net of tax, or $0.08 per share); and\nTelephonics may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for its products and services from customers in foreign countries. These agreements promote investment in the country, and may be satisfied through activities that do not require Griffon to use its cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support. These agreements may also be satisfied through the use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, setting up support centers, research and development investments, acquisitions, and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations, if applicable. The amount of the offset requirement is determined by contract value awarded and negotiated percentages with customers. At September 30, 2018, Telephonics had outstanding offset agreements approximating $40,000, primarily related to its Radar Systems division, some of which extend through 2029. Offset programs usually extend over several years and in some cases provide for penalties in the event Telephonics fails to perform in accordance with contract requirements. Historically, Telephonics has not been required to pay any such penalties and as of September 30, 2018, no such penalties are estimable or probable.\n \u25e6 AMES, founded in 1774, is the leading U.S. manufacturer and a global provider of branded consumer and professional tools, landscaping products, and outdoor lifestyle solutions. In 2018, we acquired ClosetMaid, a leader in wood and wire closet organization, general living storage and wire garage storage products for homeowners and professionals. AMES' revenue was 48%, 36%, and 35% of Griffon's consolidated revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n- Secondary equity offering costs of $1,205 ($795, net tax, or $0.02);\n \u2022 Home & Building Products (\"HBP\") consists of two companies, The AMES Companies, Inc. ( AMES\u201d) and CBP. HBP revenue accounted for 83%, 73% and 71% of Griffon's consolidated revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively: \nTrade receivables are recorded at their stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. The allowances represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations (usually due to customers' potential insolvency), discounts related to early payment of accounts receivables by customers and estimates for returns. The allowance for doubtful accounts includes amounts for certain customers in which a risk of default has been specifically identified, as well as an amount for customer defaults, based on a formula, when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. Allowance for discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue and the provision related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in SG&A expenses.\nThe Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Griffon guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries, and subject to certain covenants, limitations and restrictions. On February 5, 2018, July 20, 2016 and June 18, 2014, Griffon exchanged all of the $275,000, $125,000 and $600,000 Senior Notes, respectively, for substantially identical Senior Notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933 via an exchange offer. The fair value of the Senior Notes approximated $990,000 on September 30, 2018 based upon quoted market prices (level 1 inputs). In connection with the issuance and exchange of the $275,000 senior notes, Griffon capitalized $8,472 of underwriting fees and other expenses; in addition to $13,329 capitalized under the previously issued $725,000 Senior Notes. All capitalized fees for the Senior Notes will amortize over the term of the notes and, at September 30, 2018, $14,830 remained to be amortized.\nGriffon evaluates performance based on Earnings per share and Net income excluding restructuring charges, loss on debt extinguishment, acquisition related expenses, discrete and certain other tax items, as well other items that may affect comparability, as applicable. Griffon believes this information is useful to investors for the same reason.\n\nDuring 2018, Griffon used $5,680 in investing activities from continuing operations compared to $71,337 used in 2017. Acquired businesses totaled $430,932 in 2018 compared to $34,719 in 2017. During 2018, Griffon completed the acquisitions of ClosetMaid for approximately $185,700, inclusive of post-closing adjustments, or $165,000 net of the estimated present value of tax benefits; Harper for approximately $5,000; Kelkay for approximately $56,118 (GBP 40,452), subject to contingent consideration of GBP 7,000; and CornellCookson for approximately $180,000, excluding the estimated present value of tax benefits and $12,426 of post-closing adjustments, primarily consisting of a working capital adjustment, of which $9,219 was paid in October 2018. On February 6, 2018, the Company completed the sale of PPC to Berry for approximately $475,000.\nSegment revenue increased $71,927, or 7%, compared to the prior year period. AMES revenue increased 6%, primarily due to increased UK market expansion and contributions from the La Hacienda and Hills acquisitions, and increased Canadian snow and lawn tools sales. CBP revenue increased 8% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased volume, pricing and favorable mix.\nIn 2008, as a result of the downturn in the residential housing market, Griffon exited substantially all operating activities of its Installation Services segment which sold, installed and serviced garage doors and openers, fireplaces, floor coverings, cabinetry and a range of related building products, primarily for the new residential housing market. Griffon sold eleven units, closed one unit and merged two units into CBP. Operating results of substantially this entire segment have been reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for all periods presented; Installation Services is excluded from segment reporting.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued guidance on changes to the disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans, which makes minor changes to the disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans. The guidance requires a retrospective transition approach and is effective for the Company in fiscal 2022. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nDirect customer and end-user warranties are provided on certain products. These warranties cover manufacturing defects that would prevent the product from performing in line with its intended and marketed use. The terms of such warranties vary by product line and generally provide for the repair or replacement of the defective product. Warranty claims data is collected and analyzed with a focus on the historical amount of claims, the products involved, the amount of time between the warranty claims and the products' respective sales and the amount of current sales. Based on such analysis, warranty accruals are recorded as an increase to cost of sales and regularly reviewed for adequacy.\nIn March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to the SEC SAB 118. This ASU provides guidance on income tax accounting implications under the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" (\"TCJA\"). SAB 118 addressed the application of GAAP to situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared and analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA and allows companies to record provisional amounts during the re-measurement period not to exceed one year after the enactment date while the accounting impact remains under analysis. This guidance was effective immediately upon issuance. See Note 11 Income Taxes for further details.\nAllowances for Discount, Doubtful Account and Returns\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those periods and will be effective for the Company beginning in 2020. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nInventories, stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out or average) or market, include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs.\nNewly issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements\nFair value estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Any changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects, which may result from a decline in Griffon's stock price, a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of Griffon's control, or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of Griffon's reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.\nDefense Electronics\nAll of the defined benefit plans are frozen and have ceased accruing benefits.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Income from continuing operations to Adjusted income from continuing operations and Earnings per common share from continuing operations to Adjusted earnings per common share from continuing operations:\nThe preparation of Griffon's consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in public disclosures of Griffon, including information regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions, and form the basis for estimating the carrying values of assets and liabilities, as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment for commitments and contingencies. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates.\nThe prior year results included the following from continuing operations:\nusing a modified retrospective transition approach to all annual and interim periods presented and is effective for the company beginning in fiscal 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nGriffon's effective tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which Griffon operates. For interim financial reporting, the annual tax rate is estimated based on projected taxable income for the full year, and a quarterly income tax provision is recorded in accordance with the anticipated annual rate. As the year progresses, the annual tax rate is refined as new information becomes available, including year-to-date financial results. This process often results in changes to the effective tax rate throughout the year. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions.\nTO ADJUSTED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on lease accounting requiring lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for long-term leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. This guidance must be applied\nRevenue and profits on cost-reimbursable type contracts recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract at an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the estimated profit on those costs. The estimated profit on a cost-reimbursable contract may be fixed or variable based on the contractual fee arrangement. Incentive and award fees on these contracts are recorded as revenue when the criteria under which they are earned are reasonably assured of being met and can be estimated.\ncompletion. The cost performance and estimates to complete on long-term contracts are reviewed, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis, as well as when information becomes available that would necessitate a review of the current estimate. Adjustments to estimates for a contract's estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss often are required as experience is gained, and as more information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may or may not change, or if contract modifications occur. The impact of such adjustments or changes to estimates is made on a cumulative basis in the period when such information has become known. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, income from operations included net favorable/(unfavorable) catch-up adjustments approximating $1,400, $600 and $(700), respectively. Gross profit is affected by a variety of factors, including the mix of products, systems and services, production efficiencies, price competition and general economic conditions.\nOn September 29, 2017, AMES Australia completed the acquisition of Tuscan Landscape Group Pty, Ltd. (\"Tuscan Path\"), a leading Australian provider of pots, planters, pavers, decorative stone, and garden decor products, for approximately $18,000\nGriffon evaluates performance and allocates resources based on each segment's operating results from continuing operations before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, unallocated amounts (mainly corporate overhead), restructuring charges, loss on debt extinguishment and acquisition related expenses, as well as other items that may affect comparability, as applicable ( Segment adjusted EBITDA\u201d, a non-GAAP measure). Griffon believes this information is useful to investors for the same reason.\n______________\n- Cost of life insurance benefit of $2,614 ($248, net tax, or $0.01); and\nWarranty Accruals\n(Unaudited)\nRevenue from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2017 was $1,524,997, compared to $1,477,035 in the prior year, an increase of 3%. This resulted from increased revenue at Home & Building Products, partially offset by decreased revenue at Telephonics. Gross profit for 2017 was $408,116 compared to $400,693 in 2016, with gross margin as a percent of sales ( gross margin\u201d) of 26.8% and 27.1%, respectively.\nBeginning in the second half of fiscal 2016, the Company assembled a team to analyze the impact of the standard, and the related guidance issued, across all revenue streams and to evaluate the impact of the new standard on revenue contracts. This team reviewed current accounting policies and practices, identifying potential differences that would result from applying the requirements under the new standard. As noted above, the Company will adopt this new standard in the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. The standard will not impact revenue recognition practices at the Company's Home and Building Products Segment, but will have an impact at its Defense Electronics Segment. The Company will adopt the new standard by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. We expect this adjustment to opening retained earnings to be approximately $5,000 with an immaterial impact to our net income on an ongoing basis.\nlease is secured by a mortgage on the real estate and is guaranteed by Griffon. The Ocala, Florida lease contains two five-year renewal options. As of September 30, 2018, $7,423 was outstanding, net of issuance costs.\nThe following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\naccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\nTelephonics earns a substantial portion of its revenue as either a prime or subcontractor from contract awards with the U.S. Government, as well as non-U.S. governments and other commercial customers. These formal contracts are typically long-term in nature, usually greater than one year. Revenue and profits from these long-term fixed price contracts are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Revenue and profits on fixed-price contracts that contain engineering as well as production requirements are recorded based on the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to the total estimated costs for each contract (cost-to-cost method). Using the cost-to-cost method, revenue is recorded at amounts equal to the ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred divided by total estimated costs at completion, multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue, less the cumulative revenue recognized in prior periods. The profit recorded on a contract using this method is equal to the current estimated total profit margin multiplied by the cumulative revenue recognized, less the amount of cumulative profit previously recorded for the contract in prior periods. As this method relies on the substantial use of estimates, these projections may be revised throughout the life of a contract. Components of this formula and ratio that may be estimated include gross profit margin and total costs at\nbe established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses; a forecast of future profitability; the duration of statutory carryback and carryforward periods; the Company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and tax planning alternatives. The likelihood that the deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income is assessed at least quarterly, and the valuation allowance, if any, is adjusted accordingly.\nExcluding these items from both reporting periods, 2017 Income from continuing operations would have been $18,954, or $0.44 per share compared to $18,924, or $0.43 per share, in 2016.\nRestructuring Reserves\nGriffon has issued stock-based compensation to certain employees, officers and directors in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units.\nManagement assesses Griffon's liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, bank lines of credit and the ability to attract long-term capital under satisfactory terms. Griffon believes it has sufficient liquidity available to invest in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing its capital structure on both a short-term and long-term basis.\nOn December 21, 2009, Griffon issued $100,000 principal of 4% convertible subordinated notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes\u201d). On July 14, 2016, Griffon announced that it would settle, upon conversion, up to $125,000 of the conversion value of the 2017 Notes in cash, with amounts in excess of $125,000, if any, to be settled in shares of Griffon common stock. On January 17, 2017, Griffon settled the convertible debt for $173,855 with $125,000 in cash, utilizing borrowings under the Credit Agreement, and $48,858, or 1,954,993 shares of common stock issued from treasury.\n\nInterest expense from continuing operations in 2018 of $65,568 increased 27% compared to the prior year of $51,513, primarily as a result of increased debt levels related to the October 2017 add-on offering of $275,000 of 5.25% senior notes due 2022, partially offset by lower outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility.\nthe impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\n \u25e6 CBP, since 1964, is a leading manufacturer and marketer of residential and commercial garage doors and sells to professional dealers and some of the largest home center retail chains in North America. In 2018, we acquired CornellCookson, a leading U.S. manufacturer and marketer of rolling steel door and grille products designed \nOn October 2, 2017, Griffon acquired ClosetMaid LLC (\"ClosetMaid\") for approximately $185,700, inclusive of post-closing adjustments, or $165,000 net of the estimated present value of tax benefits resulting from the transaction. ClosetMaid, founded in 1965, is a leading North American manufacturer and marketer of wood and wire closet organization, general living storage and wire garage storage products and sells to some of the largest home center retail chains, mass merchandisers, and direct-to-builder professional installers in North America. The accounts, affected for preliminary adjustments to reflect fair market values assigned to assets purchased and liabilities assumed, and results of operations of ClosetMaid are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition of October 2, 2017. See Note 2, Acquisitions.\nOn November 14, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.0725 per share, payable on December 20, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 29, 2018.\nCash used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2017 included net proceeds from debt of $62,989, a share premium payment of $24,997 related to the settlement of Griffon's 4% convertible subordinated notes, $15,841 for the repurchase of common stock, $10,908 for the purchase of common stock for Griffon's ESOP plan and $10,325 for the payment of dividends. On January 17, 2017, Griffon settled the convertible debt for $173,855 with $125,000 in cash, utilizing borrowings under the Credit Agreement, and $48,858, or 1,954,993 shares of common stock issued from treasury.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nContractual Obligations\n b.

The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.\nAs of September 30, 2018, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $24,900. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the U.S., and we do not currently anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event we determine that funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the U.S., we will be required to accrue and pay U.S taxes to repatriate these funds (unless U.S. taxes have already been paid).\nSegment depreciation and amortization of $47,398 in 2017 compared to the prior year of $45,851, increased $1,547 primarily due to depreciation for new assets placed in service.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which permits entities to reclassify, to retained earnings, the one-time income tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) arising from the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. An entity that elects to make this reclassification must consider all items in AOCI that have tax effects stranded as a result of the tax rate change, and must disclose the reclassification of these tax effects as well as the entity's policy for releasing income tax effects from AOCI. This guidance may be applied either retrospectively or as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nDuring 2017, cash used in investing activities from continuing operations were primarily driven by acquisitions and capital expenditures. During 2017 Griffon completed the acquisitions of Tuscan Landscape Group Pty, Ltd. for approximately $18,000 (AUD 22,250); La Hacienda for approximately $11,400 (GBP 9,175); and Hills Home Living for approximately $6,051 (AUD 8,400).\nDuring 2017, total other comprehensive income, net of taxes, of $20,760 consisted of a $10,667 income on Foreign currency translation adjustments primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro, Canadian, British, Brazilian and Australian currencies, all in comparison to the U.S. Dollar; a $9,203 gain from Pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily due to higher assumed discount rates compared to the prior year and a $890 gain on cash flow hedges.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies the definition of a business, which will impact many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The new standard is intended to help companies and other organizations evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods and will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nOn November 6, 2017, AMES acquired Harper Brush Works ( Harper\u201d), a division of Horizon Global, for approximately $5,000. Harper is a leading U.S. manufacturer of cleaning products for professional, home, and industrial use. The acquisition will broaden AMES' long-handle tool offering in North America to include brooms, brushes, and other cleaning tools and accessories. The acquisition is expected to contribute approximately $10,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nRevenue Recognition\nSegment Depreciation and Amortization\nremains under the August 2016 and 2018 Board authorized repurchase programs. In addition to the repurchases under Board authorized programs, during 2018, 199,978 shares, with a market value of $4,495, or $22.48 per share, were withheld to settle employee taxes due upon the vesting of restricted stock.\nRevenue is recognized when the following circumstances are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) delivery has occurred, title has transferred or services are rendered, c) price is fixed and determinable and d) collectability is reasonably assured. Goods are sold on terms that transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location. Revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met, including transfer of title and risk of loss, which occurs either upon shipment or upon receipt by customers at the location specified in the terms of sale. Other than standard product warranty provisions, sales arrangements provide for no other significant post-shipment obligations. From time to time and for certain customers, rebates and other sales incentives, promotional allowances or discounts are offered, typically related to customer purchase volumes, all of which are fixed or determinable and are classified as a reduction of revenue and recorded at the time of sale. Griffon provides for sales returns allowances based upon historical returns experience.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nDuring 2018, the Board of Directors approved four quarterly cash dividends each for $0.07 per share. In addition, on March 7, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share paid on April 16, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 29, 2018.

The acquisition of La Hacienda broadens AMES' global outdoor living and lawn and garden business and supports AMES' UK expansion strategy. La Hacienda, as expected, generated approximately GBP 14,000 of revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nfor commercial, industrial, institutional, and retail use. CBP's revenue was 35%, 37% and 36% of Griffon's consolidated revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe current year results included the following from continuing operations:\nUnallocated Amounts\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses from continuing operations of $339,089 increased 7% from the prior year amount of $318,353. SG&A for 2017, as a percent of revenue, was 22.2%, compared to 21.6% in the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of $9,617 of acquisition related expenditures.\nCash provided by financing activities from continuing operations in 2018 totaled $39,065 compared to a use of cash of $700 in the prior year. On October 2, 2017, Griffon completed an add-on offering of $275,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2022 in an unregistered offering through a private placement. The $275,000 senior notes were issued under the same indenture pursuant to which Griffon previously issued $725,000 in aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% Senior Notes due 2022. The proceeds were used to purchase ClosetMaid and reduce the outstanding balance of Griffon's revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Agreement\")). At September 30, 2018, there were $25,000 in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, compared to $144,216 in outstanding borrowings at the same date in the prior year.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nGriffon has significant intangible and tangible long-lived assets on its balance sheet that includes goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. As required under GAAP, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment annually, for Griffon as of September 30, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, using discounted future cash flows for each reporting unit. The testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment involves significant use of judgment and assumptions in the determination of a reporting unit's fair market value. Based upon the results of the annual impairment review, it was determined that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value of the assets, and no impairment existed as of September 30, 2018.\n(AUD 22,250). The acquisition of Tuscan Path broadens AMES' outdoor living and lawn and garden business, and will strengthen AMES' industry leading position in Australia. Tuscan Path, as expected, generated approximately AUD 25,000 of revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nA UK subsidiary of Griffon maintained an invoice discounting arrangement secured by trade receivables.

The following have been identified as the most critical accounting policies and estimates:\nRevenue in 2017 decreased $23,965, or 6%, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to decreased multi-mode radar revenue and certain ground surveillance systems, partially offset by favorable performance on electronic countermeasure systems revenue.\n2018 Compared to 2017\n (c) Griffon funds required payouts under its non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plan from its general assets and the expected payments are included in each period, as applicable. \nOn June 4, 2018, CBP completed the acquisition of CornellCookson, a leading US manufacturer and marketer of rolling steel door and grille products designed for commercial, industrial, institutional and retail use, for $180,000, excluding certain post-closing adjustments. After taking into account the net of the estimated present value of tax benefits resulting from the transaction, the effective purchase price is approximately $170,000. The acquisition of CornellCookson substantially expanded CBP's non-residential product offerings, and added an established professional dealer network focused on rolling steel door and grille products for commercial, industrial, institutional and retail use. CornellCookson is expected to generate approximately $200,000 in revenue in the first full year of operations.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Segment operating profit to Income before taxes from continuing operations:\nOn October 2, 2017, in an unregistered offering through a private placement under Rule 144A, Griffon completed the add-on offering of $275,000 principal amount of its 5.25% senior notes due 2022, at 101.0% of par, to Griffon's previously issued $125,000 principal amount of its 5.25% senior notes due 2022, at 98.76% of par, completed on May 18, 2016 and $600,000 5.25% senior notes due in 2022, at par, which was completed on February 27, 2014 (collectively the Senior Notes\u201d). As of September 30, 2018, outstanding Senior Notes due totaled $1,000,000; interest is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1. The net proceeds of the $275,000 add-on offering were used to acquire ClosetMaid, with the remaining proceeds used to pay down outstanding loan borrowings under Griffon's Revolving Credit Facility (the \"Credit Agreement\"). The net proceeds of the previously issued $125,000 add-on offering were used to pay down outstanding revolving loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nIn September 2015 and March 2016, Griffon entered into mortgage loans in the amount of $32,280 and $8,000, respectively, and were due to mature in September 2025 and April 2018, respectively. The mortgage loans were secured and collateralized by four properties occupied by Griffon's subsidiaries and were guaranteed by Griffon. The loans had an interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.50%. The loans were paid off during the year ended September 30, 2018.\nRevenue in 2018 decreased $85,390, or 21%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreased maritime surveillance radar and electronic countermeasure systems revenue.\nGRIFFON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nInventories\n2017 Compared to 2016\nFor 2017, unallocated amounts, which consist primarily of corporate overhead costs, totaled $42,398 compared to $40,393 in 2016, with the increase primarily due to compensation and incentive costs.\nNo other customer exceeded 10% or more of consolidated revenue. Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon's largest customers and our relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to change and may fluctuate materially. The loss of all or a portion of volume from any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on Griffon's liquidity and operations.\nGriffon sponsors defined and supplemental benefit pension plans for certain active and retired employees. Annual amounts relating to these plans are recorded based on actuarial projections, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases and turnover rates. The actuarial assumptions used to determine pension liabilities, assets and expense are reviewed annually and modified based on current economic conditions and trends. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the nature of the plans' investments and expectations for long-term rates of return. The discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a corporate bond spot-rate yield curve that matches projected future benefit payments, with the appropriate spot rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit payments. Assumptions used in determining Griffon's obligations under the defined benefit pension plans are believed to be reasonable, based on experience and advice from independent actuaries; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect Griffon's financial position or results of operations.\n (d) Due to the uncertainty of the potential settlement of future uncertain tax positions, management is unable to estimate the timing of related payments, if any, that will be made subsequent to 2018. These amounts do not include any potential indirect benefits resulting from deductions or credits for payments made to other jurisdictions. \nA small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon's consolidated revenue. In 2018:\nSegment operating profit decreased $4,681 from the prior year primarily due to the decreased revenue noted above and the impact of revised estimates to complete remaining performance obligations on certain airborne intercommunications systems. The prior year included a $5,137 contract settlement charge.\nAt September 30, 2018, Griffon and its subsidiaries were in compliance with the terms and covenants of its credit and loan agreements. Net Debt to EBITDA (Leverage), as calculated in accordance with the definition in the Credit Agreement, was 5.5x at September 30, 2018.\n\nGriffon reported pretax income from continuing operations of $33,810 for the year ended September 30, 2018 compared to $16,698 for the prior year. In 2018, the Company recognized a tax provision of 1.6% compared to 6.5% in 2017. The 2018 tax rate included $9,384 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, primarily from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and the provisional amount recorded for the IRC section 965 transition tax on the untaxed foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits, related to the TCJA. The 2017 tax rate included $8,274 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, related primarily to excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense, a federal domestic production activities deduction and a federal R&D credit.\nIn August 2016, Griffon's ESOP entered into an agreement that refinanced the existing ESOP loan into a new Term Loan in the amount of $35,092 (the \"Agreement\"). The Agreement also provided for a Line Note with $10,908 available to purchase shares of Griffon common stock in the open market. During 2017, Griffon's ESOP purchased 621,875 shares of common stock for a total of $10,908 or $17.54 per share, under a borrowing line that has now been fully utilized. On June 30, 2017, the Term Loan and Line Note were combined into a single Term Loan. The Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.0%. The Term Loan requires quarterly principal payments of $569 with a balloon payment due at maturity on March 22, 2020. As a result of the special cash dividend of $1.00 per share, paid on April 16, 2018, the outstanding balance of the Term Loan was reduced by $5,705. As of September 30, 2018, $34,508, net of issuance costs, was outstanding under the Term Loan. The Term Loan is secured by shares purchased with the proceeds of the loan and with a lien on a specific amount of Griffon assets (which lien ranks pari passu with the lien granted on such assets under the Credit Agreement) and is guaranteed by Griffon.\nAcquisitions\nHeadquartered in New York, N.Y., the Company was founded in 1959 and is incorporated in Delaware. Griffon is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol GFF.\n- Discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $8,274, or $0.19 per share.\nOn each of August 3, 2016 and August 1, 2018, Griffon's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50,000 of Griffon's outstanding common stock. Under these share repurchase programs, the Company may purchase shares in the open market, including pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan, or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2018, Griffon purchased 2,088,739 shares of common stock under these repurchase programs, for a total of $41,110 or $19.68 per share. At September 30, 2018, $58,327 remains under Board repurchase authorizations.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued guidance on simplifying the presentation of deferred income taxes, requiring deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be classified as non-current in the statement of financial position. The guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and may be applied retrospectively or prospectively. The Company early adopted this guidance in fiscal 2016 in order to simplify balance sheet presentation and applied it retrospectively for all periods presented in the financial statements.\nOn June 4, 2018, Clopay Building Products Company, Inc. (\"CBP\") acquired CornellCookson, Inc. (\"CornellCookson\"), a leading US manufacturer and marketer of rolling steel door and grille products designed for commercial, industrial, institutional and retail use, for $180,000, excluding certain post-closing adjustments. After taking into account the estimated present value of tax benefits resulting from the transaction, the effective purchase price is approximately $170,000. CornellCookson is expected to generate approximately $200,000 in revenue in the first full year of operations. The accounts, affected for preliminary adjustments to reflect fair market values assigned to assets purchased and liabilities assumed, and results of operations of CornellCookson, are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition of June 4, 2018. See Note 2, Acquisitions.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nAmounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in revenue only when the amount can be reliably estimated and realization of the amount is probable, and are determined on a percentage-of-completion basis measured by the cost-to-cost method.\nCash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2018 was $66,446 compared to $49,151 in 2017. Cash provided by income from continuing operations, adjusted for non-cash expenditures, was offset by a net increase in working capital, primarily from increased inventory. 2018 included $14,821 of cash expenditures related to items that affect comparability, primarily related to acquisition diligence compared to $1,318 in 2017.\nInstallation Services and Other Discontinued Activities\nPrior year acquisitions\n\nStock-based Compensation\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIncome Taxes\nThe 2017 results included the following from continuing operations:\nFor contracts whose anticipated total costs exceed total expected revenue, an estimated loss is recognized in the period when identifiable. A provision for the entire amount of the estimated loss is recorded on a cumulative basis. The estimated remaining costs to complete loss contracts, as of September 30, 2018 was $12,200 and is recorded as a reduction to gross margin on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). This loss had an immaterial impact to Griffon's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGriffon Corporation (the Company\u201d or Griffon\u201d) is a diversified management and holding company that conducts business through wholly-owned subsidiaries. Griffon oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among them and manages their capital structures. Griffon provides direction and assistance to its subsidiaries in connection with acquisition and growth opportunities as well as in connection with divestitures. In order to further diversify, Griffon also seeks out, evaluates and, when appropriate, will acquire additional businesses that offer potentially attractive returns on capital.\nOff-Set Agreements\n- Discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $9,384 or $0.22 per share, primarily from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and the provisional amount recorded for the IRC section 965 transition tax on the untaxed foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits related to the TCJA.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued guidance related to customer's accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. The guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). The guidance permits either a prospective or retrospective transition approach and is effective for the Company in fiscal 2021. We are currently evaluating\nGriffon currently conducts its continuing operations through two reportable segments:\nOVERVIEW\nExcluding the discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, and certain other items from continuing operations, as listed below, the effective tax rates for the year ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were 33.8% and 39.7%, respectively. These rates reflect the impact of tax reserves and changes in earnings mix between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\n(Unless otherwise indicated, all references to years or year-end refers to the fiscal year ending September 30 and dollars are in thousands, except per share data)\nExcluding these items from both reporting periods, 2018 Income from continuing operations would have been $32,086, or $0.76 per share compared to $18,954, or $0.44 per share, in 2017.\n\nOn October 2, 2017, Griffon completed the acquisition of ClosetMaid, a market leader of home storage and organization products, for approximately $185,700, inclusive of post-closing adjustments, or $165,000 net of the estimated present value of tax benefits resulting from the transaction. ClosetMaid adds to Griffon's Home and Building Products segment, complementing and diversifying Griffon's portfolio of leading consumer brands and products. ClosetMaid, as expected, generated over $300,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nTax benefits are recognized for an uncertain tax position when, in management's judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount that is judged to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized in the period in which they are identified. The effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which Griffon has recorded a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, Griffon believes its liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate. Favorable resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in Griffon's tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit could increase the tax provision and effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as non-current. However, if it is anticipated that a cash settlement will occur within one year, that portion of the liability is presented as current. Interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded as income tax expense.\nThe 2016 results included discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $857 or $0.02 per share from continuing operations.\nInterest expense from continuing operations in 2017 of $51,513 increased 3% compared to the prior year of $49,943 primarily as a result of increased debt levels related to the May 2016 add-on offering of $125,000 of 5.25% senior notes due 2022 and higher outstanding borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility.\n - Acquisition costs of $9,617 ($6,145, net of tax, or $0.14 per share); \nIn May 2017, the FASB issued guidance to address the situation when a company modifies the terms of a stock compensation award previously granted to an employee. This guidance is effective, and should be applied prospectively, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nIn addition to the repurchases under Board authorized programs, during 2018, 199,978 shares, with a market value of $4,495, or $22.48 per share, were withheld to settle employee taxes due upon the vesting of restricted stock.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued guidance on management's responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern and related footnote disclosures. Management is required to evaluate, at each reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. This guidance was effective prospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning in 2017; implementation of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\n- Acquisition costs of $7,597 ($5,047, net of tax, or $0.12 per share);\n \u2022 Defense Electronics segment consists of Telephonics Corporation (\"Telephonics\"), founded in 1933, a globally recognized leading provider of highly sophisticated intelligence, surveillance and communications solutions for defense, aerospace and commercial customers. Telephonics' revenue was 17%, 27% and 29% of Griffon's consolidated revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n\nIn August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued guidance on the Statement of Cash Flows Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). This guidance addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This guidance will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not believe this will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nDuring 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company declared and paid dividends totaling $0.28 per share, $0.24 per share and $0.20 per share, respectively. In addition, on March 7, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share paid on April 16, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 29, 2018. The Company currently intends to pay\nGriffon reported pretax income from continuing operations of $16,698 for the year ended September 30, 2017 compared to $32,213 for the prior year. In 2017, the Company recognized a tax benefit of 6.5% compared to a tax provision of 38.6% in 2016. The 2017 tax rate included $8,274 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, related primarily to excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense, a federal domestic production activities deduction and a federal R&D credit. The 2016 tax rate included an $857 of discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, related primarily to excess tax benefits from the vesting of equity awards within income tax expense and the release of unrecognized tax benefits.\nOn December 30, 2016, AMES Australia acquired Home Living (\"Hills\") for approximately $6,051 (AUD 8,400). Hills, founded in 1946, is a market leader in the supply of clothesline, laundry and garden products. The Hills acquisition adds to AMES' existing broad category of products and enhances its lawn and garden product offerings in Australia. Hills, as expected, generated approximately AUD 10,000 of revenue in the first twelve months after acquisition.\nPayments related to Telephonics revenue are received in accordance with the terms of development and production subcontracts; certain of such receipts are progress or performance based payments. With respect to HBP, uncollected receivables have been immaterial in amount.\nDuring 2018, Telephonics was awarded new contracts and incremental funding on existing contracts approximating $320,300. Contract backlog was $344,900 at September 30, 2018 with 69% expected to be fulfilled in the next 12 months; backlog was $350,900 at September 30, 2017. Backlog is defined as unfilled firm orders for products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer or Congress, in the case of the U.S. government agencies. The decrease in backlog was primarily due to the timing of various U.S. and international contract awards associated with radar and surveillance opportunities.\nSegment operating profit in 2018 was $130,487 compared to $89,495 in 2017, an increase of $40,992, or 46%. Excluding the impact of acquisition related costs, Segment operating profit would have been $132,867 in the current year and $90,219 in the prior year, increasing 47% from the prior year, primarily driven by the increased revenue as noted above, partially offset by increased steel and resin costs, and tariffs. Segment depreciation and amortization increased $7,986 from the prior year primarily from acquisitions.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nREPORTABLE SEGMENTS\n2018 Compared to 2017\nRECONCILIATION OF INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn 2018, capital expenditures, net, totaled $49,475 compared to $34,794 in 2017.\ndividends each quarter; however, payment of dividends is determined by the Board of Directors at its discretion based on various factors, and no assurance can be provided as to the payment of future dividends.\nIn November 2012, Garant G.P. ( Garant\u201d) entered into a CAD 15,000 ($11,498 as of September 30, 2018) revolving credit facility. The facility accrues interest at LIBOR (USD) or the Bankers Acceptance Rate (CDN) plus 1.3% per annum (3.70% LIBOR USD and 3.24% Bankers Acceptance Rate (CDN) as of September 30, 2018). The revolving facility matures in October 2019. Garant is required to maintain a certain minimum equity. As of September 30, 2018, there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility with CAD 15,000 ($11,498 as of September 30, 2018) available for borrowing.\nIn July 2016, Griffon Australia Holdings Pty Ltd and its Australian subsidiaries (\"Griffon Australia\") entered into an AUD 30,000 term loan and an AUD 10,000 revolver. The term loan refinanced two existing term loans and the revolver replaced two existing lines. In December 2016, the amount available under the revolver was increased from AUD 10,000 to AUD 20,000 and, in March 2017 the term loan commitment was increased by AUD 5,000. In September 2017, the term commitment was increased by AUD 15,000. The term loan requires quarterly principal payments of AUD 1,250 plus interest with a balloon payment of AUD 37,125 due upon maturity in October 2019, and accrues interest at Bank Bill Swap Bid Rate BBSY\u201d plus 2.00% per annum (3.99% at September 30, 2018). As of September 30, 2018, the term had an outstanding balance of AUD 40,875 ($29,546 as of September 30, 2018). The revolving facility matures in March 2019, but is renewable upon mutual agreement with the lender, and accrues interest at BBSY plus 2.0% per annum (3.90% at September 30, 2018). At September 30, 2018, the revolver had an outstanding balance of AUD 11,000 ($7,951 at September 30, 2018). The revolver and the term loan are both secured by substantially all of the assets of Griffon Australia and its subsidiaries. Griffon guarantees the term loan. Griffon Australia is required to maintain a certain minimum equity level and is subject to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charges cover ratio.\nOther income (expense) from continuing operations of $1,231 in 2018 and $(880) in 2017 consists primarily of currency exchange transaction gains and losses from receivables and payables held in non-functional currencies, and net gains on investments.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which a tax benefit has been recorded in the income statement. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should\nOn March 22, 2016, Griffon amended its Credit Agreement to increase the credit facility from $250,000 to $350,000, extend its maturity from March 13, 2020 to March 22, 2021, and modify certain other provisions of the facility. On October 2, 2017 and on May 31, 2018, Griffon amended the Credit Agreement in connection with the ClosetMaid and the CornellCookson acquisitions, respectively, to modify the net leverage covenant. The facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility with a limit of $50,000 and a multi-currency sub-facility of $100,000. The Credit Agreement provides for same day borrowings of base rate loans. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and re-borrowed at any time, subject to final maturity of the facility or the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement. Interest is payable on borrowings at either a LIBOR or base rate benchmark rate, in each case without a floor, plus an applicable margin, which adjusts based on financial performance. Current margins are 1.75% for base rate loans and 2.75% for LIBOR loans. The Credit Agreement has certain financial maintenance tests including a maximum total leverage ratio, a maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants place limits on Griffon's ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, and make restricted payments and investments. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Griffon's material domestic subsidiaries and are secured, on a first priority basis, by substantially all domestic assets of the Company and the guarantors, and a pledge of not greater than 65% of the equity interest in Griffon's material, first-tier foreign subsidiaries (except that a lien on the assets of Griffon's material domestic subsidiaries securing a limited amount of the debt under the credit agreement relating to Griffon's Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") ranks pari passu with the lien granted on such assets under the Credit Agreement). At September 30, 2018, under the Credit Agreement, there were $25,000 outstanding borrowings; outstanding standby letters of credit were $14,623; and $310,377 was available, subject to certain loan covenants, for borrowing at that date.\nFor 2018, unallocated amounts, consisting primarily of corporate overhead costs, totaled $45,812 compared to $42,398 in 2017, with the increase primarily due to compensation, incentive and relocation costs.\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses from continuing operations of $433,110 increased 28% from the prior year amount of $339,089, primarily due to the inclusion of $7,597 of acquisition related expenditures as well as incremental SG&A expenses associated with these acquisitions. SG&A for 2018, as a percent of revenue, was 21.9%, compared to 22.2% in the prior year.\nDuring 2018, total other comprehensive income, net of taxes, of $26,369 included a gain of $14,866 related to the removal of PPC's foreign currency translation loss, which is considered in the gain on the disposal of discontinued operations; a loss of $5,463 from foreign currency translation adjustments primarily due to the weakening of the Euro, Canadian, British and Australian currencies, all in comparison to the U.S. Dollar; a $16,381 gain from Pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily associated with a $10,053 SERP benefit related to the passing of our Chairman of the Board and higher assumed discount rates compared to the prior year; and a $585 gain on cash flow hedges.\nThe Company\nOn November 16, 2017, Griffon announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell PPC and on February 6, 2018, completed the sale to Berry for approximately $475,000. As a result, Griffon classified the results of operations of the PPC business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets. All results and information presented exclude PPC unless otherwise noted. PPC is a global leader in the development and production of embossed, laminated and printed specialty plastic films for hygienic, health-care and industrial products and sells to some of the world's largest consumer products companies.\nIn July 2018, the AMES Companies UK Ltd and its subsidiaries (\"Ames UK\") entered into a GBP 14,000 term loan, GBP 4,000 mortgage loan and GBP 5,000 revolver. The term loan and mortgage loan require quarterly principal payments of GBP 350 and GBP 83 plus interest, respectively, and have balloon payments due upon maturity, in July 2023, of GBP 7,000 and GBP 2,333, respectively. The Term Loan and Mortgage Loans accrue interest at the GBP LIBOR Rate plus 2.25% and 1.8%, respectively (3.05% and 2.60% at September 30, 2018, respectively). The revolving facility matures in July 2019, but is renewable upon mutual agreement with the lender, and accrues interest at the Bank of England Base Rate plus 1.5% (2.25% as of September 30, 2018). The revolver and the term loan are both secured by substantially all of the assets of Ames UK and its subsidiaries. Ames UK is subject to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charges cover ratio. The invoice discounting arrangement was canceled and replaced by the above loan facilities. As of September 30, 2018, outstanding borrowings on these facilities totaled $23,987.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update related to new revenue recognition guidance that supersedes the existing revenue recognition guidance and most industry-specific guidance applicable to revenue recognition. According to the new guidance, an entity will apply a principles-based five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The core principle of the guidance is that the recognition of revenue should depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The converged standard also includes more robust disclosure requirements which will require entities to provide sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Subsequently, the FASB has issued amendments to certain aspects of the guidance including the effective date. The effective date of this revised standard is for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The converged standard can be adopted using a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective method, which applies the new guidance to contracts that are not completed at the adoption date without adjusting prior reporting periods. The Company has completed its assessment of the impact of this standard which will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of its 2019 fiscal year and will adopt this guidance using the modified retrospective method.\nPension Benefits\nExcept for operating leases and purchase obligations as disclosed herein, Griffon is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nIncome from continuing operations was $17,783, or $0.41 per share, for 2017 compared to $19,781, or $0.45 per share in the prior year.\nSegment operating profit decreased $12,858 from the prior year period. During 2017, Telephonics recorded a $5,137 charge, consisting of a settlement in the amount of $4,250 plus 2% interest and associated legal costs, related to certain amounts the civil division of the US Department of Justice indicated it believed it was owed from Telephonics with respect to certain US government contracts, performed during the 2005 to 2013 time period, in which Telephonics acted as a subcontractor. Excluding these charges, segment operating profit in the current year would have been $35,080, a $7,721 decrease from the prior year period primarily due to the decreased revenue noted above, unfavorable program mix and the impact of revised estimates to complete remaining performance obligations on certain radar and communication programs.\n (a) Included in long-term debt are capital leases of: $3,759 (less than 1 year), $5,547 (1-3 years), $468 (3-5 years) and $0 (more than 5 years). \nAt September 30, 2018, Griffon's liabilities for PPC and Installations Services and other discontinued operations primarily related to insurance claims, income taxes and product liability, warranty and environmental reserves and stay and transaction bonuses totaling liabilities of approximately $9,858. See Note 6, Discontinued Operations.\nOther long-term debt primarily consists of a loan with the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority, with the balance consisting of capital leases.\nOn each of August 3, 2016 and August 1, 2018, Griffon's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50,000 of Griffon's outstanding common stock. Under these share repurchase programs, the Company may purchase shares in the open market, including pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan, or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2018, Griffon purchased 2,088,739 shares of common stock under these repurchase programs, for a total of $41,110 or $19.68 per share. At September 30, 2018, $58,327\nExcluding the discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, and certain other items from continuing operations, as listed below, the effective tax rates for the year ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were 39.7% and 41.3%, respectively. These rates reflect the impact of tax reserves and changes in earnings mix between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\nOther income (expense) from continuing operations of $(880) in 2017 and $(250) in 2016 consists primarily of currency exchange transaction gains and losses from receivables and payables held in non-functional currencies, and net gains on investments.\nAt September 30, 2018, Griffon had debt, net of cash and equivalents, as follows:\nOn November 16, 2017, Griffon announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell Clopay Plastic Products Company, Inc. (\"PPC\") and on February 6, 2018, completed the sale to Berry Global, Inc. (\"Berry\") for approximately $475,000. As a result, Griffon classified the results of operations of the PPC business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets. All results and information presented exclude PPC unless otherwise noted. See Note 6, Discontinued Operations.\nIncome from continuing operations was $33,255, or $0.78 per share, for 2018 compared to $17,783, or $0.41 per share in the prior year.\nOn February 13, 2018, AMES acquired Kelkay, a leading United Kingdom manufacturer and distributor of decorative outdoor landscaping products sold to garden centers, retailers and grocers in the UK and Ireland for approximately $56,118 (GBP 40,452), subject to contingent consideration of up to GBP 7,000. This acquisition broadened AMES' product offerings in the market and increased its in-country operational footprint. Kelkay is expected to contribute approximately $40,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.\nSegment depreciation and amortization of $55,334 in 2018 compared to the prior year of $47,398, increased $7,936 primarily due to depreciation and amortization on assets acquired in acquisitions.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance on Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as the classification of related matters in the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for annual periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016 using either prospective, retrospective or modified retrospective transition method, depending on the area covered in this update. The Company early adopted this guidance for fiscal 2016 in order to simplify the accounting for employee share-based payments.\n\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued guidance on changes to the disclosure requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which eliminates, amends, and adds disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The amended and new disclosure requirements primarily relate to Level 3 fair value measurements. The removal and amendment of certain disclosures may be early adopted with retrospective application while the new disclosure requirements are to be applied prospectively. The guidance is effective for the Company in fiscal 2021.We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS\n a. The U.S. Government and its agencies, through prime and subcontractor relationships, represented 10% of Griffon's consolidated revenue and 62% of Telephonics' revenue. \nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements.\nClopay Plastics Products\nProceeds from the $600,000 5.25% senior notes due in 2022 were used to redeem $550,000 of 7.125% senior notes due 2018, to pay a call and tender offer premium of $31,530 and to make interest payments of $16,716, with the balance used to pay a portion of the related transaction fees and expenses. In connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes, all obligations under the $550,000 of 7.125% senior notes due in 2018 were discharged.\nGriffon substantially concluded remaining disposal activities in 2009. There was no reported revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016. During the year ended September 30, 2017, Griffon recorded $5,700 of reserves in discontinued operations related to historical environmental remediation efforts and to increase the reserve for homeowner association claims (HOA) related to installation services.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued amendments to the Compensation - Retirement Benefits guidance which requires companies to retrospectively present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and retiree medical plans along with other compensation costs in operating income and present the other components of net periodic benefit cost below operating income in the income statement. The guidance also allows only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization within inventory or fixed assets on a prospective basis. This guidance is effective, and should be applied retroactively, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nHome & Building Products\nUnder this guidance all excess tax benefits ( windfalls\u201d) and deficiencies ( shortfalls\u201d) related to employee stock compensation was recognized within income tax expense for the year ended September 30, 2016. Under prior guidance, windfalls were recognized to Capital in excess of par value and shortfalls were only recognized to the extent they exceed the pool of windfall tax benefits. As a result of the adoption, a tax benefit of $2,193 was recognized within income tax expense reflecting the excess tax benefits for the year ended September 30, 2016. The adoption was on a prospective basis and therefore had no impact on prior years. Additionally, income tax benefits at settlement of an award were previously reported as a reduction to operating cash flows and an increase to financing cash flows to the extent that those benefits exceeded the income tax benefits reported in earnings during the award's vesting period. Griffon has elected to apply that change in cash flow classification on a prospective basis, which has resulted in a $2,291 increase to net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding decrease to net cash used in financing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the amounts previously reported. The remaining provisions of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on the\nLong-lived amortizable intangible assets, such as customer relationships and software, and tangible assets, primarily Property, plant and equipment, are amortized over their expected useful lives, which involve significant assumptions and estimates. Long-lived intangible and tangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset when an impairment indicator, such as change in business, customer loss or obsolete technology, exists.\n (b) Purchase obligations are generally for the purchase of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Griffon uses blanket purchase orders to communicate expected requirements to certain vendors. Purchase obligations reflect those purchase orders in which the commitment is considered to be firm. Purchase obligations that extend beyond 2018 are principally related to long-term contracts received from customers of Telephonics. \nOn December 10, 2013 Griffon repurchased 4,444,444 shares of common stock from GS Direct in a private transaction at a per share price of $11.25, an approximate 9.2% discount to the stock's closing price on November 12, 2013, the day before announcement of the transaction. On June 19, 2018, GS Direct completed an underwritten secondary offering to sell 5,583,375 shares of Griffon's common stock, inclusive of the underwriters' 30-day option to purchase additional shares. Following the closing of the offering, GS Direct no longer owns any shares of Griffon. GS Direct's initial 10,000,000 share investment was in 2008.\n- Discrete and certain other tax benefits, net, of $8,274, or $0.19 per share.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nFrom time to time, Griffon will establish restructuring reserves at an operation. These reserves, for both termination and other exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though Griffon believes the estimates made are reasonable, they could differ materially from the actual costs.\nRevenue from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2018 was $1,977,918, compared to $1,524,997 in the prior year, an increase of 30%, primarily driven by increased revenue at Home & Building Products from both recent acquisitions and organic growth, partially offset by decreased revenue at Telephonics. Gross profit for 2018 was $529,560 compared to $408,116 in 2017, with gross margin as a percent of sales ( gross margin\u201d) of 26.8%, consistent with the prior year.\nGriffon's businesses typically do not require inventory that is susceptible to becoming obsolete or dated. In general, Telephonics sells products in connection with programs authorized and approved under contracts awarded by the U.S. Government or agencies thereof, and in accordance with customer specifications. HBP produces doors, long-handled tools and landscaping products, and storage and organizational products in response to orders from customers of retailers and dealers or based on expected orders, as applicable.\nTwo Griffon subsidiaries have capital leases outstanding for real estate located in Troy, Ohio and Ocala, Florida. The leases mature in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and bear interest at fixed rates of approximately 5.0% and 8.0%, respectively. The Troy, Ohio\nCritical Accounting Policies\nSegment operating profit in 2017 was $89,495 compared to $79,682 in 2016, an increase of $9,813, or 12%, driven by the increased revenue noted above and favorable product mix, partially offset by increased steel and resin costs. Segment depreciation and amortization increased $1,280 from the prior year period.\nGoodwill, Long-Lived Intangible and Tangible Assets, and Impairment\nAcquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date and that the fair value of acquired in-process research and development be recorded on the balance sheet. Related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the purchase price over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nSegment revenue increased $538,311, or 48%, compared to the prior year period due to the AMES' acquisitions of La Hacienda, Tuscan Path, ClosetMaid (\"CM\"), Harper and Kelkay, and CBP's acquisition of CornellCookson (\"CC\"), as well as increased favorable mix and price at CBP and AMES, and volume increases at CBP and AMES' non US locations, offset by AMES US decrease due to unfavorable weather. 2018 CM and CC revenue was $311,568 and $66,654, respectively. Organic growth was 7%.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, Griffon used cash for discontinued operations from operating, investing and financing activities of $78,927, primarily related to PPC operations and the settling of certain Installation Services and environmental liabilities. Cash flows from investing activities of discontinued operations of $10,762 related primarily to capital expenditures.\n\n - Acquisition costs of $9,617 ($6,145, net of tax, or $0.14 per share);  - Contract settlement charges of $5,137 ($3,300, net of tax, or $0.08 per share); and\n- Contract settlement charges of $5,137 ($3,300, net of tax, or $0.08 per share); and\nTelephonics may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for its products and services from customers in foreign countries. These agreements promote investment in the country, and may be satisfied through activities that do not require Griffon to use its cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support. These agreements may also be satisfied through the use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, setting up support centers, research and development investments, acquisitions, and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations, if applicable. The amount of the offset requirement is determined by contract value awarded and negotiated percentages with customers. At September 30, 2018, Telephonics had outstanding offset agreements approximating $40,000, primarily related to its Radar Systems division, some of which extend through 2029. Offset programs usually extend over several years and in some cases provide for penalties in the event Telephonics fails to perform in accordance with contract requirements. Historically, Telephonics has not been required to pay any such penalties and as of September 30, 2018, no such penalties are estimable or probable.\n \u25e6 AMES, founded in 1774, is the leading U.S. manufacturer and a global provider of branded consumer and professional tools, landscaping products, and outdoor lifestyle solutions. In 2018, we acquired ClosetMaid, a leader in wood and wire closet organization, general living storage and wire garage storage products for homeowners and professionals. AMES' revenue was 48%, 36%, and 35% of Griffon's consolidated revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n- Secondary equity offering costs of $1,205 ($795, net tax, or $0.02);\n \u2022 Home & Building Products (\"HBP\") consists of two companies, The AMES Companies, Inc. ( AMES\u201d) and CBP. HBP revenue accounted for 83%, 73% and 71% of Griffon's consolidated revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively: \nTrade receivables are recorded at their stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. The allowances represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations (usually due to customers' potential insolvency), discounts related to early payment of accounts receivables by customers and estimates for returns. The allowance for doubtful accounts includes amounts for certain customers in which a risk of default has been specifically identified, as well as an amount for customer defaults, based on a formula, when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. Allowance for discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue and the provision related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in SG&A expenses.\nThe Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Griffon guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries, and subject to certain covenants, limitations and restrictions. On February 5, 2018, July 20, 2016 and June 18, 2014, Griffon exchanged all of the $275,000, $125,000 and $600,000 Senior Notes, respectively, for substantially identical Senior Notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933 via an exchange offer. The fair value of the Senior Notes approximated $990,000 on September 30, 2018 based upon quoted market prices (level 1 inputs). In connection with the issuance and exchange of the $275,000 senior notes, Griffon capitalized $8,472 of underwriting fees and other expenses; in addition to $13,329 capitalized under the previously issued $725,000 Senior Notes. All capitalized fees for the Senior Notes will amortize over the term of the notes and, at September 30, 2018, $14,830 remained to be amortized.\nGriffon evaluates performance based on Earnings per share and Net income excluding restructuring charges, loss on debt extinguishment, acquisition related expenses, discrete and certain other tax items, as well other items that may affect comparability, as applicable. Griffon believes this information is useful to investors for the same reason.\n\nDuring 2018, Griffon used $5,680 in investing activities from continuing operations compared to $71,337 used in 2017. Acquired businesses totaled $430,932 in 2018 compared to $34,719 in 2017. During 2018, Griffon completed the acquisitions of ClosetMaid for approximately $185,700, inclusive of post-closing adjustments, or $165,000 net of the estimated present value of tax benefits; Harper for approximately $5,000; Kelkay for approximately $56,118 (GBP 40,452), subject to contingent consideration of GBP 7,000; and CornellCookson for approximately $180,000, excluding the estimated present value of tax benefits and $12,426 of post-closing adjustments, primarily consisting of a working capital adjustment, of which $9,219 was paid in October 2018. On February 6, 2018, the Company completed the sale of PPC to Berry for approximately $475,000.\nSegment revenue increased $71,927, or 7%, compared to the prior year period. AMES revenue increased 6%, primarily due to increased UK market expansion and contributions from the La Hacienda and Hills acquisitions, and increased Canadian snow and lawn tools sales. CBP revenue increased 8% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased volume, pricing and favorable mix.\nIn 2008, as a result of the downturn in the residential housing market, Griffon exited substantially all operating activities of its Installation Services segment which sold, installed and serviced garage doors and openers, fireplaces, floor coverings, cabinetry and a range of related building products, primarily for the new residential housing market. Griffon sold eleven units, closed one unit and merged two units into CBP. Operating results of substantially this entire segment have been reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for all periods presented; Installation Services is excluded from segment reporting.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued guidance on changes to the disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans, which makes minor changes to the disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans. The guidance requires a retrospective transition approach and is effective for the Company in fiscal 2022. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nDirect customer and end-user warranties are provided on certain products. These warranties cover manufacturing defects that would prevent the product from performing in line with its intended and marketed use. The terms of such warranties vary by product line and generally provide for the repair or replacement of the defective product. Warranty claims data is collected and analyzed with a focus on the historical amount of claims, the products involved, the amount of time between the warranty claims and the products' respective sales and the amount of current sales. Based on such analysis, warranty accruals are recorded as an increase to cost of sales and regularly reviewed for adequacy.\nIn March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to the SEC SAB 118. This ASU provides guidance on income tax accounting implications under the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" (\"TCJA\"). SAB 118 addressed the application of GAAP to situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared and analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA and allows companies to record provisional amounts during the re-measurement period not to exceed one year after the enactment date while the accounting impact remains under analysis. This guidance was effective immediately upon issuance. See Note 11 Income Taxes for further details.\nAllowances for Discount, Doubtful Account and Returns\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those periods and will be effective for the Company beginning in 2020. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nInventories, stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out or average) or market, include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs.\nNewly issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements\nFair value estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Any changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects, which may result from a decline in Griffon's stock price, a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of Griffon's control, or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of Griffon's reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.\nDefense Electronics\nAll of the defined benefit plans are frozen and have ceased accruing benefits.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Income from continuing operations to Adjusted income from continuing operations and Earnings per common share from continuing operations to Adjusted earnings per common share from continuing operations:\nThe preparation of Griffon's consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in public disclosures of Griffon, including information regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions, and form the basis for estimating the carrying values of assets and liabilities, as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment for commitments and contingencies. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates.\nThe prior year results included the following from continuing operations:\nusing a modified retrospective transition approach to all annual and interim periods presented and is effective for the company beginning in fiscal 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nGriffon's effective tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which Griffon operates. For interim financial reporting, the annual tax rate is estimated based on projected taxable income for the full year, and a quarterly income tax provision is recorded in accordance with the anticipated annual rate. As the year progresses, the annual tax rate is refined as new information becomes available, including year-to-date financial results. This process often results in changes to the effective tax rate throughout the year. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions.\nTO ADJUSTED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on lease accounting requiring lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for long-term leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. This guidance must be applied\nRevenue and profits on cost-reimbursable type contracts recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract at an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the estimated profit on those costs. The estimated profit on a cost-reimbursable contract may be fixed or variable based on the contractual fee arrangement. Incentive and award fees on these contracts are recorded as revenue when the criteria under which they are earned are reasonably assured of being met and can be estimated.\ncompletion. The cost performance and estimates to complete on long-term contracts are reviewed, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis, as well as when information becomes available that would necessitate a review of the current estimate. Adjustments to estimates for a contract's estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss often are required as experience is gained, and as more information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may or may not change, or if contract modifications occur. The impact of such adjustments or changes to estimates is made on a cumulative basis in the period when such information has become known. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, income from operations included net favorable/(unfavorable) catch-up adjustments approximating $1,400, $600 and $(700), respectively. Gross profit is affected by a variety of factors, including the mix of products, systems and services, production efficiencies, price competition and general economic conditions.\nOn September 29, 2017, AMES Australia completed the acquisition of Tuscan Landscape Group Pty, Ltd. (\"Tuscan Path\"), a leading Australian provider of pots, planters, pavers, decorative stone, and garden decor products, for approximately $18,000\nGriffon evaluates performance and allocates resources based on each segment's operating results from continuing operations before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, unallocated amounts (mainly corporate overhead), restructuring charges, loss on debt extinguishment and acquisition related expenses, as well as other items that may affect comparability, as applicable ( Segment adjusted EBITDA\u201d, a non-GAAP measure). Griffon believes this information is useful to investors for the same reason.\n______________\n- Cost of life insurance benefit of $2,614 ($248, net tax, or $0.01); and\nWarranty Accruals\n(Unaudited)\nRevenue from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2017 was $1,524,997, compared to $1,477,035 in the prior year, an increase of 3%. This resulted from increased revenue at Home & Building Products, partially offset by decreased revenue at Telephonics. Gross profit for 2017 was $408,116 compared to $400,693 in 2016, with gross margin as a percent of sales ( gross margin\u201d) of 26.8% and 27.1%, respectively.\nBeginning in the second half of fiscal 2016, the Company assembled a team to analyze the impact of the standard, and the related guidance issued, across all revenue streams and to evaluate the impact of the new standard on revenue contracts. This team reviewed current accounting policies and practices, identifying potential differences that would result from applying the requirements under the new standard. As noted above, the Company will adopt this new standard in the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. The standard will not impact revenue recognition practices at the Company's Home and Building Products Segment, but will have an impact at its Defense Electronics Segment. The Company will adopt the new standard by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. We expect this adjustment to opening retained earnings to be approximately $5,000 with an immaterial impact to our net income on an ongoing basis.\nlease is secured by a mortgage on the real estate and is guaranteed by Griffon. The Ocala, Florida lease contains two five-year renewal options. As of September 30, 2018, $7,423 was outstanding, net of issuance costs.\nThe following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\naccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\nTelephonics earns a substantial portion of its revenue as either a prime or subcontractor from contract awards with the U.S. Government, as well as non-U.S. governments and other commercial customers. These formal contracts are typically long-term in nature, usually greater than one year. Revenue and profits from these long-term fixed price contracts are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Revenue and profits on fixed-price contracts that contain engineering as well as production requirements are recorded based on the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to the total estimated costs for each contract (cost-to-cost method). Using the cost-to-cost method, revenue is recorded at amounts equal to the ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred divided by total estimated costs at completion, multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue, less the cumulative revenue recognized in prior periods. The profit recorded on a contract using this method is equal to the current estimated total profit margin multiplied by the cumulative revenue recognized, less the amount of cumulative profit previously recorded for the contract in prior periods. As this method relies on the substantial use of estimates, these projections may be revised throughout the life of a contract. Components of this formula and ratio that may be estimated include gross profit margin and total costs at\nbe established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses; a forecast of future profitability; the duration of statutory carryback and carryforward periods; the Company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and tax planning alternatives. The likelihood that the deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income is assessed at least quarterly, and the valuation allowance, if any, is adjusted accordingly.\nExcluding these items from both reporting periods, 2017 Income from continuing operations would have been $18,954, or $0.44 per share compared to $18,924, or $0.43 per share, in 2016.\nRestructuring Reserves\nGriffon has issued stock-based compensation to certain employees, officers and directors in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units.\nManagement assesses Griffon's liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, bank lines of credit and the ability to attract long-term capital under satisfactory terms. Griffon believes it has sufficient liquidity available to invest in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing its capital structure on both a short-term and long-term basis.\nOn December 21, 2009, Griffon issued $100,000 principal of 4% convertible subordinated notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes\u201d). On July 14, 2016, Griffon announced that it would settle, upon conversion, up to $125,000 of the conversion value of the 2017 Notes in cash, with amounts in excess of $125,000, if any, to be settled in shares of Griffon common stock.

The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.\nAs of September 30, 2018, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $24,900. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the U.S., and we do not currently anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event we determine that funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the U.S., we will be required to accrue and pay U.S taxes to repatriate these funds (unless U.S. taxes have already been paid).\nSegment depreciation and amortization of $47,398 in 2017 compared to the prior year of $45,851, increased $1,547 primarily due to depreciation for new assets placed in service.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which permits entities to reclassify, to retained earnings, the one-time income tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) arising from the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. An entity that elects to make this reclassification must consider all items in AOCI that have tax effects stranded as a result of the tax rate change, and must disclose the reclassification of these tax effects as well as the entity's policy for releasing income tax effects from AOCI. This guidance may be applied either retrospectively or as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nDuring 2017, cash used in investing activities from continuing operations were primarily driven by acquisitions and capital expenditures.

The new standard is intended to help companies and other organizations evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods and will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and related disclosures.\nOn November 6, 2017, AMES acquired Harper Brush Works ( Harper\u201d), a division of Horizon Global, for approximately $5,000.

In addition to the repurchases under Board authorized programs, during 2018, 199,978 shares, with a market value of $4,495, or $22.48 per share, were withheld to settle employee taxes due upon the vesting of restricted stock.\nRevenue is recognized when the following circumstances are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) delivery has occurred, title has transferred or services are rendered, c) price is fixed and determinable and d) collectability is reasonably assured. Goods are sold on terms that transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location. Revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met, including transfer of title and risk of loss, which occurs either upon shipment or upon receipt by customers at the location specified in the terms of sale. Other than standard product warranty provisions, sales arrangements provide for no other significant post-shipment obligations. From time to time and for certain customers, rebates and other sales incentives, promotional allowances or discounts are offered, typically related to customer purchase volumes, all of which are fixed or determinable and are classified as a reduction of revenue and recorded at the time of sale. Griffon provides for sales returns allowances based upon historical returns experience.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nDuring 2018, the Board of Directors approved four quarterly cash dividends each for $0.07 per share.

key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Griffon Corporation is a diversified management and holding company that conducts business through two segments: Home & Building Products and Defense Electronics. \n\n- Revenue in 2018 was $1.98 billion, up 30% from 2017, driven by acquisitions and organic growth in the Home & Building Products segment.

These drove revenue growth of 48% in this segment compared to 2017. \n\n- The Defense Electronics segment saw a 21% revenue decline in 2018 due to decreased sales of certain surveillance systems.
