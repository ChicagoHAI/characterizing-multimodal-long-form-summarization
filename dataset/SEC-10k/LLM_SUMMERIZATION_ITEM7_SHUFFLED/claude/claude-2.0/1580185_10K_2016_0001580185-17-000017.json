Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the \"Risk Factors\" and the \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are focused on providing direct-to-consumer access to financing solutions through a variety of avenues, including: mortgage lending, structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment purchasing, prepaid cards, and access to providers of personal loans. Our direct-to-consumer businesses use digital channels, television, direct mail, and other channels to offer access to financing solutions. We warehouse, securitize, sell or otherwise finance the financial assets that we purchase in transactions that are structured to ultimately generate cash proceeds to us that exceed the purchase price we paid for those assets.\nWe currently operate our business through two business segments: (i) Structured Settlements and (ii) Home Lending. Our Structured Settlements segment provides liquidity to customers by purchasing structured settlements, annuities and lottery winnings. Structured Settlements also includes corporate activities, payment solutions, pre-settlements and providing (i) access to providers of personal lending and (ii) access to providers of funding for pre-settled legal claims. Our Home Lending segment specializes in originating, selling and servicing residential mortgage loans.\n2016 Highlights\nIn the first half of 2016, we focused on improving performance of our Structured Settlements business, maintaining adequate liquidity through funding source optimization and rigorous expense controls while continuing to grow our Home Lending business. Within our Structured Settlements business, we completed our turnaround strategy in our marketing and operations functions which enabled us to reduce costs while achieving higher conversion rates. During the second half of 2016, we concentrated on continuing to grow our market share in the Home Lending business through operational scale while focusing on capital market execution and anticipating changes in the interest rate environment. Our Home Lending business achieved record closed loan volume originations of $3.4 billion as a result of our strong affinity relationships that leveraged the strength of our brand name. We continued to access the capital markets through the execution of a securitization of our structured settlements assets and completed direct asset sales to extract what we believe was the maximum profitability based on current market conditions and underlying economics. During 2016, we completed the initial close and subsequent pre-funding transactions associated with two direct asset sales generating an aggregate of $87.0 million in net cash proceeds and the initial close associated with a securitization transaction which generated $17.6 million in net cash proceeds. In addition, we issued $207.5 million in notes collateralized by the residual asset cash flows and reserve cash associated with 36 of the Company's previously executed securitizations, which generated $65.9 million in net cash proceeds. Our payment solutions group also expanded its channels and offerings to include solutions for the lottery and gaming industries. As of December 31, 2016, our payment solutions group was still in the early stage of development and had not generated significant revenues.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Consolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>324,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>296,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>438,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>511,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73,696\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(113,355\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(215,356\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>(15,340\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,216\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>(98,015\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(197,140\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: net loss attributable to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>(51,158\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(101,828\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to The J.G.

The decrease in Structured Settlements' pre-tax loss was coupled with an increase of $27.0 million in pre-tax income generated by our Home Lending segment that was driven by growth in interest rate lock volume of approximately $4.0 billion due in part to the low interest rate environment and as a result of only five months of Home Lending's results of operations being included in the Company's consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe recorded a consolidated income tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2016 of $15.3 million compared to a benefit of $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our overall effective tax rate was 13.5% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016 compared to an overall effective rate of 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the overall effective tax rate was due primarily to the impact of the $121.6 million impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets recorded in 2015 and the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $11.9 million in 2016 due to the uncertainty that it will fully benefit from the losses incurred during the current and prior years. The Company is recording certain deferred tax liabilities as it is now required to file tax returns in jurisdictions where it has no offsetting loss carryforwards.\nThe net loss attributable to non-controlling interests represents the portion of loss attributable to the economic interests in JGW LLC held by the non-controlling Common Interestholders.

Our Home Lending segment, which we acquired on July 31, 2015, generated pre-tax income of $2.0 million in 2015.\nWe recorded a consolidated income tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2015 of $18.2 million compared to a provision for income taxes of $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our overall effective tax rate was 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to an overall effective rate of 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The reduction in the overall effective tax rate was due primarily to the impact of the permanent differences between book and taxable income (loss), including the $121.6 million impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets recorded in 2015.\nThe net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interests represents the portion of (loss) earnings attributable to the economic interests in JGW LLC held by the non-controlling Common Interestholders.

The $4.0 million decrease in interest income on pre-settlement funding transaction receivables was due to a reduction in the associated VIE and other finance receivables resulting from management's decision to curtail purchases of such assets in April 2015.\nRealized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt, and derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was comprised of the following:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Day one gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(57,845\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses from changes in fair value subsequent to day one\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,881\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,804\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55,922\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized losses on interest rate swaps related to warehouse facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,544\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(132\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,412\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,069.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables and derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57,334\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized losses on securitized finance receivables, debt and derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77,652\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75,834\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,818\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on extinguishment of securitized debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(593\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on termination of interest rate swaps related to securitized debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,053\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,053\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total realized and unrealized losses on securitized finance receivables, debt and derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(80,705\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75,241\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,464\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total realized and unrealized gains on finance receivables, securitized debt and derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(62,798\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables represent: (i) unrealized gains and losses on finance receivables acquired from customers prior to their securitization and (ii) realized gains and losses on finance receivables acquired from customers resulting from their inclusion in direct asset sale transactions.\nNewly acquired finance receivable assets are accounted for at fair value until they are securitized or disposed of pursuant to a direct asset sale. Subsequent to acquisition but prior to securitization or sale, the Company generally borrows against purchased finance receivables pursuant to one of its revolving credit facilities. When the Company borrows against its finance receivables, it transfers the encumbered assets into a VIE. If the finance receivables are securitized, immediately prior to securitization, the securitized assets are adjusted to their current fair value and the resulting change in fair value is included in gains/(losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one. If the finance receivables are included in a direct asset sale, the previously recognized unrealized gains/(losses) are reversed and the difference between the purchase price and sales price is recorded as a realized gain and included in gains/(losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one. The difference between the price paid to acquire finance receivables and their fair value at the end of the month acquired is referred to as \"day one gains\". Changes in fair value of finance receivables acquired in prior months are referred to as \"gains (losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one\".\nTotal realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $55.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease of $263.5 million, or 27.0%, in guaranteed and life contingent structured settlement, annuity and lottery TRB purchases, from $976.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $713.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe $1.5 million loss on interest rate swaps related to warehouse facilities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was the result of the termination of interest rate swaps with a notional value of $75.2 million that were executed as part of our strategy to hedge interest rate risk. The $0.1 million loss on interest rate swaps related to warehouse facilities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of the termination of interest rate swaps with a notional value of $61.1 million that were executed as part of our strategy to hedge interest rate risk.\nThe $1.8 million increase in unrealized losses on securitized finance receivables, debt and derivatives was primarily the result of: (i) a $9.4 million unfavorable change in the unrealized gain (loss) on the securitized finance receivables, debt and derivatives associated with the Peachtree Structured Settlements LLC permanent financing facility primarily due to an early amortization event that occurred during the first quarter of 2016 which resulted in future excess cash flows being applied to the prepayment of the outstanding debt and derivatives and (ii) a $9.1 million unfavorable change in the unrealized gain (loss) on other securitized finance receivables (other than the associated residual interests), securitized debt and derivatives resulting principally from movements in the fair value discount rates used to value these items, partially offset by a $16.7 million favorable change in the unrealized loss on our residual interests as a result of movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.\nThe $0.6 million gain on extinguishment of securitized debt during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from the early repayment of the 2004-A securitization debt issued by Structured Receivables Finance #1, LLC. The associated finance receivables subsequently were included in the 2015-1 securitization. There was no gain on extinguishment of securitized debt during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe $3.1 million loss on termination of interest rate swaps related to securitized debt during the year ended December 31, 2016 represents the loss on the termination of interest rate swaps related to the Peachtree Structured Settlements, LLC (\"PSS\") securitized debt that had a notional value of $13.8 million. There was no loss on the termination of interest rate swaps related to securitized debt during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nRealized and unrealized gains on marketable securities, net, was a $4.1 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2016, a favorable change from the $4.6 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to higher investment returns on marketable securities. The increase was primarily offset by a corresponding increase in installment obligations expense (income), net. These amounts relate to the marketable securities and installment obligations payable on our consolidated balance sheets. The marketable securities are owned by us but are held to fully offset our installment obligations liability. Therefore, increases or decreases in gains on marketable securities do not impact our net income.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $357.7 million, a decrease of $129.3 million, or 26.5%, from expenses of $487.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAdvertising expense, which consists of our marketing costs including television, internet, direct mail and other related expenses, decreased to $44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to a $10.0 million decrease in our television spend and a $5.1 million decrease in our internet, direct mailing, and other advertising expenses. These actions were part of our previously announced plan to turn around the Structured Settlements segment in part by overhauling our media spend. We continually assess the effectiveness of our advertising initiatives and adjust the timing, investment and advertising channels on an ongoing basis.\nInterest expense, which includes interest on our securitization and other VIE long-term debt, warehouse facilities and our term loan, increased by 5.5% to $218.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $207.1 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015. The $11.4 million increase was primarily attributable to a $11.3 million increase in interest expense associated with our VIE securitized debt that resulted from an increase in the average outstanding balance between periods, coupled with an increase in the interest rate used to calculate interest expense.\nCompensation and benefits expense decreased to $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an $8.1 million decrease in salaries, commissions and payroll taxes that resulted from a combination of lower headcount and lower commissions due to lower TRB purchase volume in the current year compared to the prior year.\nProfessional and consulting costs decreased to $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $7.9 million decrease was primarily due to third-party fees incurred in connection with the 2015 acquisition of Home Lending and an overall decrease in the use of outside consultants as part of our cost-savings initiatives.\nDebt issuance costs decreased to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $5.1 million of debt issuance costs incurred in the year ended December 31, 2016 related to: (i) $0.5 million in fees to amend certain provisions of our previously issued securitization debt, (ii) $2.6 million in fees paid in connection with the issuance of $207.5 million of notes payable that are collateralized by the residual asset cash flows and reserve cash related to 36 of our securitizations, and (iii) $2.0 million in fees paid related to the 2016-1 securitization transaction that closed in October 2016. The $6.7 million of debt issuance costs incurred in the year ended December 31, 2015 related to fees incurred in connection with three securitization transactions that closed during 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued $117.3 million in securitized debt, a decrease of $358.6 million from the $475.9 million in securitized debt issued in 2015, due primarily to the Company electing to complete two direct asset sales in the first nine months of 2016 which do not result in the issuance of securitized debt. Underwriting fees associated with our securitizations are calculated as a percentage of the principal amount of debt issued.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we re-evaluated our projections for our Structured Settlements segment based on lower than anticipated results that were included in the prior year's annual impairment test and a continued decline in the stock price of our Class A common stock. Accordingly, we determined these events constituted a triggering event requiring the Company to test the indefinite-lived trade name and finite-lived customer-relationships intangible assets acquired in connection with the 2011 acquisition of OAC for potential impairment. As a result of this analysis, we determined the trade name and the customer-relationships intangible assets within the Structured Settlements reporting unit were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $5.5 million in our consolidated statements of operations. The $5.5 million impairment charge was comprised of the following: (i) a $2.8 million write-down of the trade name and (ii) a $2.7 million write-down of the finite-lived customer relationships. We also determined that the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets within the Structured Settlements reporting unit were less than previously assigned and consequently revised them to their currently estimated useful lives of approximately three years. We also determined in connection with this analysis that the trade name is a finite-lived asset.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, based on review of our projections for our Structures Settlements segment based on lower than anticipated results, a significant decline in the stock price of our Class A common stock, and a re-assessment of the reporting unit's brand strategy, we recorded impairment charges of $121.6 million comprised of the following: (i) an $85.0 million write-down of goodwill, (ii) a $35.5 million write-down of the indefinite-lived trade name, and (iii) a $1.1 million write-down of other intangible assets.\nComparison of Structured Settlements Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

The $1.3 million decrease in interest income on pre-settlement funding transaction receivables was due to a reduction in the associated VIE and other finance receivables resulting from management's decision to curtail purchases of such assets in April 2015.\nRealized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt, and derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was comprised of the following:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Day one gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>171,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,658\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Losses) gains from changes in fair value subsequent to day one\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,804\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,709\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(367.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>215,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(60,367\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized losses on interest rate swaps related to warehouse facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(132\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(645\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables and derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>215,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59,854\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized (losses) gains on securitized finance receivables, debt and derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75,834\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(160,790\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(189.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on extinguishment of securitized debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total realized and unrealized (losses) gains on securitized finance receivables, debt and derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75,241\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(160,467\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(188.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total realized and unrealized gains on finance receivables, securitized debt and derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(220,321\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables represent: (i) unrealized gains and losses on finance receivables acquired from customers prior to their securitization and (ii) realized gains and losses on finance receivables acquired from customers resulting from their inclusion in direct asset sale transactions.\nNewly acquired finance receivable assets are accounted for at fair value until they are securitized or disposed of pursuant to a direct asset sale. Subsequent to acquisition but prior to securitization or sale, the Company generally borrows against purchased finance receivables pursuant to one of its revolving credit facilities. When the Company borrows against its finance receivables, it transfers the encumbered assets into a VIE. If the finance receivables are securitized, immediately prior to securitization, the securitized assets are adjusted to their current fair value and the resulting change in fair value is included in gains/(losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one. If the finance receivables are included in a direct asset sale, the previously recognized unrealized gains/(losses) are reversed and the difference between the purchase price and sales price is recorded as a realized gain and included in gains/(losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one. The difference between the price paid to acquire finance receivables and their fair value at the end of the month acquired is referred to as \"day one gains\". Changes in fair value of finance receivables acquired in prior months are referred to as \"gains (losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one\".\nTotal realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $60.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of the following: (i) approximately $45.2 million was due to a change in the discount rate applied to TRB purchases, or purchase yield, as compared to the prior year coupled with an unfavorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value these assets during the respective periods, and (ii) approximately $15.2 million was due to a $73.8 million decrease, or 7.0%, in guaranteed structured settlements, annuities and lotteries and life contingent structured settlements and annuities TRB purchases, from $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $976.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe $0.1 million loss on interest rate swaps related to warehouse facilities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of the termination of interest rate swaps with a notional value of $61.1 million that were executed as part of our strategy to hedge interest rate risk. The $0.6 million loss on interest rate swaps related to warehouse facilities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was the result of the termination of interest rate swaps with a notional value of $46.5 million that were executed as part of our strategy to hedge interest rate risk.\nThe $160.8 million change in unrealized (losses) gains on securitized finance receivables, debt and derivatives was primarily the result of: (i) an unfavorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a favorable movement in the associated fair value interest rate during the year ended December 31, 2014. Specifically, the discount rate used to fair value our residual interests increased from 5.97% as of December 31, 2014 to 8.30% as of December 31, 2015 as result of the widening of spreads in the asset-backed securities market during 2015. In comparison, the discount rate used to fair value our residual interests decreased from 7.85% as of December 31, 2013 to 5.97% at December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of both the decrease in spreads in the asset-backed securities market and in long term interest rates in general during 2014, both of which are used in the calculation of the fair value discount rate used to estimate the fair value of our residual interest cash flows.\nGain on extinguishment of debt, net, was $0.6 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2015 gain resulted from the early repayment of the 2004-A securitization debt. The associated finance receivables were included in the 2015-1 securitization. In 2014, we repaid approximately $6.1 million of long-term debt issued by the 2002-A securitization and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of $0.3 million.\nRealized and unrealized (losses) gains on marketable securities, net, was a $4.6 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, an unfavorable change from the $0.9 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to lower investment returns on marketable securities. The decrease was primarily offset by a corresponding decrease in installment obligations (income) expense, net. These amounts relate to the marketable securities and installment obligations payable on our consolidated balance sheets. The marketable securities are owned by us but are held to fully offset our installment obligations liability. Therefore, increases or decreases in gains on marketable securities do not impact our net income.\nThe $2.1 million decrease in realized gains on notes receivable, at fair value resulted from the repayment of a note receivable during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $487.0 million, an increase of $110.4 million, or 29.3%, from expenses of $376.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAdvertising expense, which consists of our marketing costs including television, internet, direct mail and other related expenses, decreased to $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a $13.2 million decrease in our television spend that was partially offset by a $4.7 million net increase in our internet, direct mailing, and other advertising expenses. We continually assess the effectiveness of our advertising initiatives and adjust the timing, investment and advertising channels on an ongoing basis.\nInterest expense, which includes interest on our securitization and other VIE long-term debt, warehouse facilities and our term loan, increased by 3.1% to $207.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $200.8 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2014. The $6.3 million increase was primarily attributable to: (i) a $4.2 million increase in interest expense associated with our VIE securitized debt that resulted from an increase in the average outstanding balance between periods, partially offset by a decrease in the interest rate used to calculate interest expense and (ii) a $1.9 million increase in interest expense associated with our VIE long term debt that was principally due an increase in the average outstanding balance of our residual term debt and an increase and in the corresponding interest rate. In August 2015, we amended our residual term loan to increase the principal amount outstanding by $25.0 million to $133.0 million. In connection with the amendment, the interest rate increased from 7.00% to 7.25%.\nCompensation and benefits expense decreased to $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to (i) a $3.5 million decrease in incentive compensation expense and (ii) a $1.1 million reduction in share-based compensation expense, which was partially offset by (a) a $1.0 million increase in severance expense related to the departure of several senior executives during the year ended 2015, including our former President and Chief Operating Officer, and (b) higher labor costs necessary to execute on our strategy of entering new lines of business and improving our information, data and analytic capabilities.\nProfessional and consulting costs increased to $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to $3.8 million in third-party fees incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of Home Lending and the reorganization of our structured settlement purchasing organization, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in legal expense.\nThe decrease in debt issuance costs from the prior year was due to a $1.9 million reduction in underwriting fees resulting from the lower volume of securitized debt issued in the current year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued approximately $475.9 million in securitized debt, a decrease of $193.1 million from the approximately $669.0 million in securitized debt issued in 2014. Underwriting fees associated with our securitizations are calculated as a percentage of the principal amount of debt issued.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we re-evaluated our projections for our Structured Settlements segment based on lower than anticipated results, a significant decline in the stock price of our Class A common stock, and a re-assessment of the reporting unit's brand strategy. Accordingly, we determined these events constituted a triggering event requiring us to test the goodwill and finite and indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the 2011 acquisition of OAC for potential impairment. As a result of this analysis, we determined in the third quarter that the trade name within the reporting unit was impaired and recorded a $29.9 million impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test. The results of the analysis indicated an additional impairment of the trade name as well as an impairment of the goodwill within the reporting unit. Consequently, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $91.7 million in the fourth quarter comprised of the following: (i) an $85.0 million write-down of goodwill, (ii) an additional $5.6 million write-down of the indefinite-lived trade name, and (iii) a $1.1 million write-down of other intangible assets. While we believe our assumptions used in the determination of the asset's fair value are reasonable, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Less than anticipated revenues generated by the remaining intangible assets, an increase in discount rates, and/or a decrease in our projected growth rates used in the discounted cash flow model could result in future impairment charges.\nHome Lending\nComparison of Home Lending Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

prior year since we acquired Home Lending on July 31, 2015. As a result, only five months of Home Lending's results of operations were included in the prior year's reporting period.\nInterest income principally relates to our mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, which is recognized in income prior to the loan being sold, and is based on the principal amount outstanding and contractual interest rates.\nIn evaluating performance, we net the gains on mortgage loans sold, unrealized gains on mortgage loans held for sale, interest rate lock commitments (\"IRLCs\"), and associated derivative instruments (i.e., forward sale commitments to deliver mortgage loans and forward sales of MBS) resulting from fair value mark-to-market adjustments, with direct costs such as fees paid to third parties to originate and sell the associated mortgage loans, and present it as realized and unrealized gains on sale of\nmortgage loans held for sale, net of direct costs, in our consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated $82.2 million in gross revenue from the sale of mortgage loans and netted against it $7.1 million in direct costs, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, when we generated $20.5 million in gross revenue from the sale of mortgage loans and netted against it $1.9 million in direct costs.\nU.S. GAAP requires that MSRs initially be recorded at fair value at the time the underlying mortgage loans are sold with servicing rights retained. MSRs are subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting period. The increase (decrease) in the fair value of our MSRs portfolio resulting from: (i) loans sold with servicing rights retained; (ii) the runoff of our MSRs portfolio including payoffs; and (iii) changes in fair valuation inputs and assumptions is included in changes in MSRs, net, in our consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the value of our MSRs increased by $12.4 million due to the $1.1 billion net increase in the unpaid principal balance of our MSRs portfolio, coupled with a $2.8 million increase in the fair value of MSRs resulting from the increase in mortgage interest rates during the year. From the date of acquisition through December 31, 2015, the fair value of our MSRs increased by $1.6 million primarily due to the $212.4 million net increase in the unpaid principal balance of our MSRs portfolio.\nServicing, broker and other fees represent revenue recognized for servicing mortgage loans for various investors that are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance. The primary driver of our servicing revenue is our MSRs portfolio. The outstanding unpaid principal balance of serviced mortgages was $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.1 billion from the prior year unpaid principal balance of serviced mortgages of $3.0 billion.\nLoan origination fee income earned during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $9.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively, which represents revenue earned from originating mortgage loans and generally represents flat, per loan fee amounts.\nAdvertising expense consists of our marketing costs including television, internet, direct mail and other related expenses. Advertising expense for the five months ended December 31, 2015 included $0.7 million in costs associated with the re-branding of WestStar Mortgage Inc. as J.G. Wentworth Home Lending, Inc. (and ultimately J. G. Wentworth Home Lending, LLC) and the production costs for new television commercials that began to air in the third quarter of 2015.\nInterest expense represents interest on Home Lending's: (i) five warehouse credit facilities with various financial institutions used to originate mortgage loans held for sale that had a combined maximum borrowing capacity of $365.0 million as of December 31, 2016; and (ii) a single operating line of credit, which is collateralized by our MSRs, with a maximum borrowing capacity of $10.0 million as of December 31, 2016.\nCompensation and benefits includes salaries for Home Lending employees, commissions paid to loan officers, applicable taxes and the cost of providing employee benefits. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Home Lending recorded severance charges of $0.5 million related primarily to the departure of two former owners of the acquired entity.\nHome Lending's general and administrative expense primarily represents the cost to lease and operate the segment's headquarters in Woodbridge, Virginia and the various retail and direct lending call center offices across the country.\nThe provision for losses represents estimates of losses to be incurred on the repurchase or indemnification of purchasers of mortgage loans. Certain sales contract and GSE standards require us to repurchase a loan or indemnify the purchaser or insurer for losses if a borrower fails to make initial loan payments or if the accompanying mortgage loan fails to meet certain customary representations and warranties, such as the nature and extent of underwriting standards. In the event of a breach of the representations and warranties, we may be required to either repurchase the loan or indemnify the purchaser for losses it sustains on the loan. We record a provision for estimated repurchases and loss indemnification on loans sold, which is charged to the provision for losses. In addition, the provision for losses also includes a reserve for potential losses related to impaired loans within our servicing portfolio, which include various factors such historical loss experience, actual write-offs during the period, known delinquent loans and GSE guidelines.\nReconciliation of our Segments' Net Loss (Income) to Net (Loss) Income Attributable to The J.G.

For Structured Settlements these payment streams are generally structured settlements, annuities and lottery winnings. For Home Lending we purchase mortgage loans and sell these loans with servicing retained or released.\nThe securitization or sales of the purchased assets in Structured Settlements are normally structured with an \"initial close\" in which we issue the principal amount of securitized debt and receive: (i) cash in exchange for assets delivered and (ii) restricted cash in exchange for assets to be delivered 60 to 90 days in the future (referred to as the \"pre-funding\" date). On the pre-funding date, additional assets are delivered to the lenders in return for the lifting of restrictions on the restricted cash. As a result of structuring the securitizations in this fashion, our restricted cash balances have fluctuated significantly depending on the timing of the transactions' initial close and their associated pre-funding dates. We refer to each of these transactions as a monetization event. Historically, securitizations or direct asset sales have generally had two monetization events. For our 2015-3 securitization and our single 2015 direct asset sale, we opted not to have a pre-funding date, but instead had only a single monetization event: the initial close. In 2014, we completed five monetization events that were comprised of: (i) two securitizations which each had two monetization events during the calendar year and (ii) one securitization for which the initial close occurred in 2014 and the pre-funding occurred in 2015. In 2015, we completed seven monetization events which were comprised of: (i) the pre-funding from the securitization which completed the initial close in 2014, (ii) two direct assets sales which each had two monetization events in the calendar year, (iii) one direct asset sale which completed a single monetization event, and (iv) one securitization which also completed only a single monetization event. In 2016, we completed five monetization events which were comprised of: (i) two direct assets sales which each had two monetization events and (ii) one securitization for which the initial close was completed in 2016 and the pre-funding in 2017.\nIn conjunction with the implementation of the credit risk retention rules mandated by Dodd-Frank, we expect the total net cash proceeds to be received by the Company for each securitization in the Structured Settlement segment to be less than would have been received absent the application of such rules.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(125,696\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(399,797\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>(8,697\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50,500\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(10,985\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>191,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>396,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n</td> <td>57,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $42.5 million and $(125.7) million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash provided by (used in) operating activities does not reflect the financing of our purchased receivables, which is an integral part of our Structured Settlements segment and is reflected in net cash (used in) provided by financing activities. In 2016, based on market conditions, we completed one securitization and two direct asset sales resulting in five monetization events. The $168.2 million increase in the net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to: (i) a $249.4 million increase in net proceeds from the sale of finance receivables due to management's decision to complete more direct assets sales in 2016 as compared to 2015, (ii) a $122.7 million decrease in purchases of finance receivables reflecting lower TRB purchase volume in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, (iii) a $125.0 million change in restricted cash and investments due to the timing and structure of monetization events in the fourth quarters of 2016, 2015 and 2014, (iv) a $58.5 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities resulting from the Home Lending segment's originations and purchases of mortgages held for sale (net of proceeds from the sale of and principal payments on mortgage loans held for sale), and (v) a $22.7 million decrease in the collections on finance receivables.\nNet cash provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the impact of $58.7 million increase in restricted cash that primarily related to the net effect of the following: (i) our 2015-3 securitization being structured with only an initial close and not having a pre-funding component and (ii) our 2016-1 securitization's initial close occurring in the fourth quarter of 2016 but the associated pre-funding occurring in the first quarter of 2017. As a result of the timing and the structure of the 2015-3 and 2016-1 securitizations, restricted cash increased by $58.8 million between December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016.\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 included the impact of a $66.2 million decrease in restricted cash during the year that primarily related to the net effect of: (i) the timing of 2014-3 securitization's initial close occurring in the fourth quarter of 2014 but the associated pre-funding occurring in the first quarter of 2015 and (ii) our 2015-3 securitization being structured with only an initial close and not having an associated pre-funding. The impact of the timing and structure of the 2014-3 and 2015-3 securitizations was a $71.8 million decrease in our restricted cash balance between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $8.7 million and $50.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $41.8 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to (i) the Company making the final $7.6 million purchase price payment to the former owners of the Home Lending segment during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the $47.4 million of net cash used to acquire Home Lending during the year ended December 31, 2015 and (ii) a $2.0 million decrease in purchases of premises and equipment, net of sales proceeds.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $(11.0) million and $191.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $202.9 million change was primarily attributable to: (i) a $177.0 million decrease in proceeds received from the issuance of VIE long-term debt resulting from our decision to complete two direct asset sales and one securitization in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to three securitization transactions and one direct asset sale in the year ended December 31, 2015, and includes the impact of the issuance of $207.5 million of notes payable collateralized by the residual asset cash flows and reserve cash related to 36 of our securitizations, and (ii) a $133.5 million increase in repayments of long-term debt and derivatives primarily related to the $131.4 million repayment in September 2016 of our previous $133.0 million residual term facility (\"Residual Term Facility\"), partially offset by (i) a $93.6 million increase in proceeds (net of repayments) from our revolving credit facilities and (ii) a $14.5 million reduction in purchases of treasury stock.\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $125.7 million and $399.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The cash used in operating activities does not reflect the financing of our purchased receivables which is an integral part of our Structured Settlements segment and is reflected in net cash provided by financing activities. The $274.1 million decrease in the net cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to: (i) a $155.1 million decrease related to changes in restricted cash and investments primarily due to the timing and structure of securitizations in the fourth quarters of 2015, 2014 and 2013, (ii) a $54.1 million decrease in purchases of finance receivables, (iii) a $27.0 increase in collections on finance receivables, (iv) a $24.6 million decrease resulting from the Home Lending segment's proceeds from the sale and principal payments on mortgage loans held for sale (net of originations and purchases of mortgages\nheld for sale), and (v) a $21.9 million increase in net proceeds from the sale of finance receivables.\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 included the impact of $66.2 million decrease in restricted cash during the year that primarily related to the net effect of: (a) the timing of our 2014-3 securitization's pre-funding discussed previously and (b) our 2015-3 securitization being structured with only an initial close and not having an associated pre-funding component. The impact of the timing and structure of the 2014-3 and 2015-3 securitizations was a $71.8 million of a decrease to our restricted cash balance between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015.\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 included the impact of an $88.9 million increase in restricted cash that primarily related to the net effect of the following: (a) both 2013-3 securitization's initial close and pre-funding occurring in the fourth quarter of 2013 and (b) our 2014-3 securitization's initial close occurring in the fourth quarter of 2014 but the associated pre-funding occurring in the first quarter of 2015. As a result of the timing of the 2013-3 and 2014-3 pre-fundings, restricted cash increased $71.8 million between December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $56.3 million change was primarily due to: (i) $47.4 million of net cash used to acquire our Home Lending segment in 2015 and (ii) the collection of a $6.1 million note receivable in 2014.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $191.9 million and $396.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The $204.7 million decrease was primarily attributable to a $280.7 million decrease in proceeds received from the issuance of securitization and other VIE long-term debt combined with a $10.0 million increase in purchases of treasury stock, partially offset by: (i) a $45.2 million increase in proceeds (net of repayments) from our revolving credit facilities, and (ii) a $38.1 million reduction in the repayment of securitization and other VIE long-term debt and derivatives.\nFunding Sources\nWe utilize a number of different funding sources to finance our segments and their associated business activities.\nStructured Settlements Segment\nStructured Settlements and Annuities\nWe finance our guaranteed structured settlement and annuity payment stream purchases with available cash and cash equivalents and/or through two separate warehouse facilities. As of December 31, 2016, these two warehouse facilities had $400.0 million of aggregate capacity which consisted of: (i) a $300.0 million syndicated warehouse facility with a revolving period that ends in July 2017 and (ii) a $100.0 million warehouse facility with a revolving period that ends in May 2018. Subsequent to the expiration or termination of their respective revolving lines of credit, our warehouse facilities have amortization periods of four months ($300.0 million facility) or 18 months ($100.0 million facility) before final maturity, allowing us time to exit or refinance the warehouse facility after the revolving period has ended. As of December 31, 2016, we had $343.6 million in total unused borrowing capacity across the two separate warehouse facilities used to finance our guaranteed structured settlement and annuity payment stream purchases.\nWe regularly assess our warehouse facilities and adjust the nature and amount of our committed warehouse lines in light of market conditions. Based on current and projected financing needs, we terminated a $50.0 million and a $300.0 million warehouse facility in January 2016 and May 2016, respectively. Subsequent to these terminations, our total borrowing capacity under our warehouse facilities is $400.0 million. We intend to renew or replace the two remaining guaranteed structured settlement and annuity warehouse facilities prior to the end of their respective revolving periods to better reflect our financing needs in the future.\nOur warehouse facilities are structured with advance rates that range from 92.5% to 95.5% and discount rates that range from 8.0% to 9.2%. The discount rate is either fixed over the term of the facility or is based on a fixed spread over a floating swap rate, which we then fix through interest rate swaps at the time of the borrowing. The discount rate is used to discount the payment streams we have purchased, and these discounted payment streams are then multiplied by the advance rate to determine the amount of funds that are available to us under the warehouse facilities.\nThese warehouse facilities are used strictly to fund the guaranteed structured settlement and annuity payment stream purchases. Our ability to fund current operations depends upon our ability to secure these types of short-term financings on acceptable terms and to renew or replace the financings as they expire. While we historically have been able to regularly renew the warehouse facilities in the ordinary course of business, we cannot assure that we will be able to renew, replace or refinance our existing financing arrangements or enter into additional financing arrangements on terms that are commercially reasonable or at all. In addition, a negative ratings action by a rating agency, an adverse action by a regulatory authority or a general deterioration in the economy that constricts the availability of credit may increase our cost of funds and may impair our ability to renew existing\nfacilities or obtain new financing facilities.\nWe have historically undertaken non-recourse term securitizations or direct asset sales once we have aggregated in our warehouse facilities a sufficient amount of structured settlement and annuity payment streams to undertake a securitization. At the close of each such transaction, the outstanding amount under each of the warehouse facilities is repaid. The amount of net proceeds we receive from securitizations or direct asset sales is typically in excess of the amount of funds required to repay the warehouse facilities, resulting in a positive cash flow at the time of securitization. In 2016, we completed five monetization events that consisted of two direct asset sales (each consisting of an initial close and prefunding transaction) and the initial close of a securitization. The first direct asset sale consisted of $161.3 million in discounted TRB purchases based on a deal discount rate of 5.02% and was comprised of two asset pools. The first pool, which closed on February 18, 2016, consisted of $91.3 million in discounted TRB purchases and generated net proceeds to us of $27.0 million. The second pool, which closed on April 21, 2016, consisted of $70.0 million in discounted TRB purchases and generated net proceeds to us of $21.6 million. The second direct asset sale in 2016 consisted of $110.8 million in discounted TRB purchases and was also comprised of two asset pools. The first pool, which closed on June 17, 2016, consisted of $50.8 million in discounted TRB purchases based on a deal discount rate of 4.85% and generated net proceeds to us of $18.2 million. The second pool, which closed on August 19, 2016, consisted of $59.2 million in discounted TRB purchases and generated net proceeds to us of $20.1 million. On October 26, 2016, we completed the initial close associated with our 2016-1 securitization with an aggregate note issuance amount of $117.3 million and a deal discount rate of 3.89% which generated net proceeds to us of $16.5 million. On January 20, 2017, we completed the pre-funding associated with the 2016-1 securitization which generated net proceeds to us of $15.9 million. On March 22, 2017, we completed the initial close associated with our 2017-1 securitization with an aggregate note issuance amount of $131.8 million and a deal discount rate of 4.35% which generated net proceeds to us of $15.1 million.\nWe intend, subject to market conditions, management discretion and other relevant factors, to undertake multiple securitizations or direct asset sales in the future. Although diversifying our financing strategy allows us to realize greater cost efficiencies in our capital market transactions and provides us with increased flexibility, we still believe the asset-backed securities market has been and continues to be the Company's principal market.\nThe counterparties to the structured settlement and annuity payment streams we purchase have mostly investment grade credit ratings. Approximately 75.5% of the counterparties to structured settlement payment streams that we purchased in 2016 were rated \"A3\" or better by Moody's. This reduced credit risk, together with the long weighted average life and low pre-payment risk, results in a desirable asset class that can be securitized and sold in the asset-backed security market or through outright-sale transactions.\nLife Contingent Structured Settlements and Life Contingent Annuities\nWe finance our purchases of life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams through a committed permanent financing facility with a capacity of $100.0 million that can be increased at the lender's by $50.0 million. This facility allows us to purchase life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams without assuming any mortality risk. This facility is structured as a permanent facility, whereby the life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams we purchase are financed for their entire life and remain within the facility until maturity. The payment streams purchased are funded at a fixed advance rate of 94%, while the discount rate used to value the payment streams is variable, depending on the characteristics of the payment streams. The life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams that we purchase are discounted at a higher rate than the discount rates applied to those payment streams under the committed permanent financing facility, with the result that the funds available to be drawn under the facility exceed the purchase price for the payment streams we purchase. This positive cash flow is used to support our business and cover a portion of our operating expenses. As of December 31, 2016, our permanent financing facility had $17.0 million of unused capacity for our life contingent annuity and structured settlement businesses.\nLotteries\nIn 2013, we began purchasing lottery payment streams and have structured one of our two remaining guaranteed structured settlement and annuity warehouse facilities to allow us to finance lottery payment streams. This allows us to aggregate a pool of such payment streams that we subsequently include with structured settlement and annuity payment streams in securitizations and direct asset sales. We intend to continue to include lottery payment streams in securitizations and direct asset sales in the future.\nPre-Settlement Funding\nWe previously financed our pre-settlement funding transactions through a revolving credit facility. The $35.0 million facility was structured with a revolving period that ended on December 31, 2015. The principal amount outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2015 was converted into a \"term advance\" facility requiring minimum principal payments over the subsequent 24 month amortization period with interest payable monthly and calculated in the same manner as the original credit facility. In August 2016, the Company made principal payments to fully repay this term advance facility and then terminated the facility. The Company incurred less than $0.1 million in fees related to the termination.\nWe decided, beginning in April 2015, to curtail our purchases of pre-settlement transactions. We have, however, and will continue to broker leads for such transactions to third parties in exchange for broker or referral fees, and, in the normal course of our business, will evaluate our existing pool of pre-settlement assets for retention or sale. Ceasing purchases of pre-settlement transactions has not had a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.\nCredit Facility\nWe have (i) a widely syndicated senior secured term loan with a principal balance of $449.5 million as of December 31, 2016 which matures in February 2019, and (ii) a $20.0 million revolving commitment that matures in August 2017. At each interest reset date, we have the option to elect that the senior secured term loan be either a Eurodollar loan or a Base Rate loan. If a Eurodollar loan, interest accrues at either Libor or 1.0% (whichever is greater) plus a spread of 6.0%. If a Base Rate loan, interest accrues at prime or 2.0% (whichever is greater) plus a spread of 5.0%. The revolving commitment has the same interest rate terms as the senior secured term loan. There are no principal payments due on the senior secured term loan until its maturity in February 2019.\nThe Credit Facility requires us, to the extent that as of the last day of any fiscal quarter there are outstanding balances on the revolving commitment that exceed specific thresholds (generally 15% of the $20.0 million borrowing capacity, or $3.0 million), to comply with a maximum total leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving commitment, and, as a result, the maximum total leverage ratio requirement was not applicable. Had the leverage ratio requirement been applicable as of December 31, 2016, we would not have satisfied the maximum total leverage ratio requirement and would have been required to repay the outstanding borrowings on the revolver in excess of the specified threshold.\nResidual Financing\nThe Company had a Residual Term Facility that was secured by the cash flows from our residual interests in 28 securitizations and was structured with a $133.0 million A1 Note that was due in May 2021. The interest rate on the Residual Term Facility was 7.25%. The Residual Term Facility did not require minimum annual principal payments.\nOn September 2, 2016, the Company repaid the $131.4 million outstanding balance on the Residual Term Facility through the issuance of $207.5 million of notes payable collateralized by the residual asset cash flows and reserve cash related to 36 of our securitizations. The Company incurred $0.4 million in debt termination costs and expensed $3.3 million of unamortized debt issuance costs during the three months ended September 30, 2016 in connection with the termination of this facility, which were included in interest expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\nSecuritization and Permanent Financing Debt, at Fair Value\nWe elected fair value treatment under Accounting Standards Codification 810, Financial Instruments (\"ASC 810\"), to measure the VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts and related VIE finance receivables. We have determined that measurement of the VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts at fair value better correlates with the fair value of the VIE finance receivables held by special purpose entities (\"SPEs\"), which are held to provide the cash flow for the note obligations. The debt issued by our VIE securitization and permanent financing trusts is recourse only to the respective entities that issued the debt and is non-recourse to the Company and its other subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries continue to receive fees for servicing the securitized assets which are eliminated in consolidation. In addition, the risk to our non-SPE subsidiaries from SPE losses is limited to cash reserves, residual interest amounts and repurchases of structured settlement payment streams that are subsequently determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the securitization or permanent financing trusts.\nOn September 2, 2016, the Company issued $207.5 million in notes collateralized by the residual asset cash flows and reserve cash interests related to 36 VIE securitization entities, which generated $65.9 million in net cash proceeds. The Company incurred $2.6 million of debt issuance costs which were included in debt issuance expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The Company acts as the servicer and/or the subservicer and principal and interest are paid monthly from the cash flows from these collateralized residual interests.\nOther Financing\nWe maintain other permanent financing arrangements that have been used in the past for longer term funding purposes. Each of these arrangements has assets pledged as collateral, the cash flows from which are used to satisfy the loan obligations. These other financing arrangements are more fully described in Notes 18 and 19 in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under \"Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data'\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHome Lending Segment\nMortgage Loans Held For Sale\nWe finance our mortgage loan origination activities primarily through five separate warehouse facilities that had an aggregate capacity of $365.0 million as of December 31, 2016. Subsequent to year-end, our borrowing facilities and the current\naggregate borrowing capacity were reduced to $295.0 million. In July 2016, we modified the terms of our $50.0 million warehouse facility and extended its maturity through January 2017. Under the terms of the revised facility agreement, the committed amount decreases by $5.0 million each month through maturity, starting in August 2016. In January 2017, we extended the renewal date of this facility from January 6, 2017 to February 5, 2017, at which time the line expired and was not renewed. In October 2016, we increased the capacity of our $50.0 million warehouse line of credit to $70.0 million and in January 2017, the capacity reverted to $50.0 million. In January 2017, we increased the capacity of our $75.0 million warehouse line of credit to $100.0 million and we extended the renewal date of our $95.0 million warehouse line of credit from February 10, 2017 to February 9, 2018. In March 2017, we canceled the $100.0 million warehouse line of credit that was scheduled to mature in September 2017. Also, in March 2017, we received a commitment of $50.0 million from a new lender for a warehouse line of credit on competitive terms. As of March 29, 2017, our borrowing facilities have an aggregate borrowing capacity of $295.0 million. We regularly assess our warehouse facilities and adjust the amount and the terms of our committed warehouse lines in light of market conditions.\nThese credit facilities are generally renewed annually for a period of 12 months and represent secured lending facilities with our originated mortgage loans serving as collateral. In addition, our lenders require pledge fund deposits of approximately one percent of the facility's capacity be maintained with the lender. Without these facilities we would not be able to meet our short-term liquidity requirements to operate our Home Lending segment.\nOur Home Lending segment typically holds its mortgage loan inventory for 30 to 45 days with these warehouse facilities until the loans are sold to take-out investors or securitized directly with Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, at which time the amount outstanding with the warehouse facilities are repaid.\nThese warehouse facilities are used strictly to fund the origination of mortgage loans. Our ability to fund current operations depends upon our ability to secure these types of short-term financings on acceptable terms and to renew or replace the financings as they expire. These warehouse facilities are uncommitted and, at any given time, we may not be able to obtain additional financing under them when we need it, exposing us to, among other things, liquidity risks of the types described in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. While we historically have been able to regularly renew the warehouse facilities in the ordinary course of business, we cannot assure that we will be able to renew, replace or refinance our existing financing arrangements or enter into additional financing arrangements on terms that are commercially reasonable or at all. In addition, a negative ratings action by a rating agency, an adverse action by a regulatory authority or a general deterioration in the economy that constricts the availability of credit may increase our cost of funds and may impair our ability to renew existing facilities or obtain new financing facilities.\nOperating Line of Credit\nWe maintain a $10.0 million line of credit with a financial institution that is generally renewed annually for a period of 12 months and represents a secured lending facility with our MSRs serving as collateral. In August 2016, we increased the capacity of this line of credit to $10.0 million from $6.0 million and extended the maturity date through June 16, 2017. The Company may only draw on $4.0 million of the capacity until we receive regulatory approval.\nConsolidated Liquidity Needs\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $80.2 million. Our primary source of funds for the Structured Settlements and Home Lending segments include secured borrowings in the form of warehouse lines of credit and revolving credit facilities with financial institutions. These credit facilities are generally renewed for a period of 12 to 18 months. In the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our financing needs and adjust our aggregate borrowing capacity in light of current and projected business needs and market conditions. Although we have historically been able to renew or replace these facilities in advance of their maturity to ensure our ongoing liquidity and access to capital, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. Further, it is likely that GNMA will place restrictions on the cash generated by Home Lending such that it can only be used for Home Lending's operations and cannot be used for corporate-level purposes. Due to the risk retention rules from Dodd-Frank, in the future we will need to retain an additional portion of the credit risk of the assets which will result in less cash available at each securitization. Despite this restriction, we believe our cash on hand and cash generated from the purchase and subsequent securitization or direct asset sale of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams will allow us to meet our current and future liquidity needs over the next 12 months. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to securitize or sell our payment streams or mortgage loans at favorable rates. We may also consider selling our pre-settlement assets or financing these or other uncollateralized assets.\nOur most significant need for liquidity beyond the next 12 months is the repayment of the principal and interest amounts of our outstanding senior secured term loan. We anticipate utilizing cash on hand, cash flow generated through our securitization and direct-asset sale program and bank borrowings for our long-term liquidity needs. If available, we may also utilize debt refinancings and new debt and equity offerings for our long-term liquidity needs. We have engaged a consultant to assist us in evaluating our capital structure and refinancing our outstanding indebtedness. However, there can be no assurances that we will have sufficient cash reserves, or that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or that future borrowings or refinancings will be available in an amount sufficient to be able to fund our liquidity needs on a long-term basis.\nAs a consequence of the initial sales and any future exchanges of Common Interests for shares of our Class A common stock or Class C common stock, we may increase our share of the tax basis of the assets then owned by JGW LLC. Any such increase in tax basis is anticipated to allow us the ability to reduce the amount of future tax payments to the extent that we have future taxable income. We are obligated, pursuant to our tax receivable agreement with all Common Interestholders who held in excess of approximately 1% of the Common Interests as of immediately prior to our IPO, to pay to such Common Interestholders 85% of the amount of income tax we save for each tax period as a result of the tax benefits generated from the initial sales and any subsequent exchange of Common Interests for our Class A common stock or Class C common stock and from the use of certain tax attributes. We expect to fund these long-term requirements under the tax receivable agreement with tax distributions received from JGW LLC and, if necessary, loans from JGW LLC.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments (excluding interest rate swaps which are discussed in \"Derivatives and Other Hedging Instruments\") as of December 31, 2016, and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. The table also reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding debt based on scheduled and/or expected repayment dates and the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2016. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as referenced in the table:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies and estimates that we consider to be critical.\nConsolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The J.G. Wentworth Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest, and those variable interest entities where our wholly-owned subsidiaries are the primary beneficiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved with various entities that are considered to be VIEs. A VIE is an entity that has either a total investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest under the voting interest model of consolidation. We are required to consolidate any VIE if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has the power to direct those activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses from or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We review all significant interests in the VIEs we are involved with including consideration of the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance and whether we have control over those activities. As a result of adopting ASC 810, we determined we were the primary beneficiary of the VIEs used to securitize our finance receivables (\"VIE finance receivables\"). We elected the fair value option with respect to assets and liabilities in our securitization VIEs as part of their initial consolidation on January 1, 2010.\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE or whether we have acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. The reassessment also considers whether we have acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be significant to the VIE. As a result of this assessment, the consolidation status of the legal entities with which we are involved may change.\nThe debt issued by our securitization VIEs is reported on our consolidated balance sheets as VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts, at fair value (\"VIE securitization debt\"). The VIE securitization debt is recourse solely to the VIE finance receivables held by such SPEs and is non-recourse to us and our other consolidated subsidiaries. The VIEs will continue in operation until all securitization debt is paid and all residual cash flows are collected. As a result of the long lives of many finance receivables purchased and securitized by us, most consolidated VIEs have expected lives in excess of 20 years.\nWe acquire receivables associated with structured settlement payments from individuals in exchange for cash, and these receivables are carried at fair value in VIE finance receivables, at fair value, and Other finance receivables, at fair value, on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Unearned income is calculated as the amount the fair value exceeds the cost basis of the receivables. Unearned income on VIE and other finance receivables is recognized as interest income using the effective interest method over the life of the related structured settlement. Changes in fair value are recorded in realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long- term debt and derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe, through our subsidiaries, sell finance receivables to SPEs. An SPE issues notes secured by undivided interests in the receivables. Payments due on these notes generally correspond to receipts from the receivables in terms of the timing of payments due. We retain an interest in the SPEs and are deemed to have control over these SPEs due to our servicing or subservicing role and therefore consolidate these SPEs.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when the following conditions have been satisfied: (1) the transferred assets have been isolated from the Company, beyond the reach of the Company and its creditors; (2) the transferee obtains the right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets; and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity, or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets or through an agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them. Transfers that do not meet the criteria to be accounted for as sales are accounted for as secured borrowings.\nThe amendments to ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing (\"ASC 860\"), eliminated the concept of a qualified special purpose entity, changed the requirements for derecognizing financial assets, and required additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions and continuing involvement with transferred financial assets.\nFair Value Measurements\nUnder ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure (\"ASC 820\"), fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurement establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value. These three levels of fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices in markets that are not active or quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable, reflecting the entity's own assumptions about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the assets or owes the liabilities rather than an entity specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities at the measurement date. We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We also evaluate various factors to determine whether certain transactions are orderly and may make adjustments to transactions or quoted prices when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have decreased significantly.\nThe above conditions could cause certain assets and liabilities to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 3 or reclassified from Level 2 to Level 3. The inputs or methodology used for valuing the assets or liabilities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with the assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in the business combination, and is accounted for under ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC 350\"). Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment at the reporting-unit level on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates. We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for impairment is necessary. The initial qualitative approach assesses whether the existence of events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, the two step quantitative impairment test is performed. A step 1 analysis involves calculating the fair value of the associated reporting unit and comparing it to the reporting unit's carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill and the carrying value of the reporting unit is positive, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, step 2 of the impairment test must be performed. Step 2 involves calculating and comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value. Impairment is recognized if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its net book value. Such loss is calculated as the difference between the estimated implied fair value of goodwill and its carrying amount.\nWe have intangible assets which have indefinite and finite lives, which are accounted for under ASC 350. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's carrying value may not be fully recoverable, and are tested at least annually. An impairment loss, calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset, is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset is less than the corresponding carrying value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of licenses and approvals.\nFinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of databases, customer relationships, trade names and affinity relationships. Our databases are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. Customer relationships are amortized over their useful lives of 3 years to 15 years. Amortizable trade names are amortized over their useful life of 3 years. Affinity relationships are amortized over their useful life of 10 years.\nIncome Taxes\nJGW LLC and the majority of its subsidiaries operate in the U.S. as non-tax paying entities, and are treated as disregarded entities for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes and generally as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, certain of JGW LLC's wholly-owned subsidiaries are operating as corporations within the U.S. and subject to U.S. federal and state tax. As non-tax paying entities, the majority of JGW LLC's net income or loss is attributable to its members and included in their tax returns. The current and deferred income tax provision (benefit) relates to both the income (loss) attributable to the Corporation from JGW LLC and to the tax-paying subsidiaries of JGW LLC.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the liability method of accounting in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of the differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe analyze our tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state and local tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, we determine that uncertainties\nin tax positions exist, a reserve will be established. We will recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our consolidated statements of operations.\nTax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and evaluating tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties under U.S. GAAP. Management reviews its tax positions periodically and adjusts its tax balances as new information becomes available.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe qualify as an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and do, rely on exemptions from certain financial disclosure requirements under U.S. GAAP that are not applicable to other companies that are not emerging growth companies. In particular, we can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards which allows us to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We took advantage of the extended transition period as permitted under JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which relates to how an entity recognizes the revenue it expects to be entitled to for the transfer of promised goods and services to customers. In the first six months of 2016, the FASB issued amendments to this standard (ASU Nos. 2016-8, 2016-10, 2016-11, 2016-12 and 2016-20), which provide further clarification regarding this standard. ASU 2014-09 will replace certain existing revenue recognition guidance when it becomes effective. The original effective date of the guidance was deferred in August 2015 by the issuance of ASU No. 2015-14 and is effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period and for all other entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Management has commenced its implementation activities and determined that the following revenue streams are not impacted by or are excluded from the scope of this ASU: a) interest income, b) realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives, c) realized and unrealized gains on sale of mortgage loans held for sale, net of direct costs d) changes in mortgage servicing rights, net, e) loan servicing fees, and f) realized and unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities, net. Management is continuing to evaluate the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which requires an entity to re-evaluate its consolidation for limited partnerships or similar entities. This ASU requires an entity to apply this amendment using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period of adoption. This ASU changes the criteria that an entity uses to identify a variable interest entity, how it characterizes the VIE for a limited partnership or similar entity and how it determines the primary beneficiary. For public entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and for nonpublic entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control, which further clarified ASU No. 2015-02. This update amends the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a VIE should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. Entities that have not yet adopted the amendments in ASU No. 2015-02 are required to adopt the amendments in ASU 2016-17 at the same time they adopt the amendments in ASU No. 2015-02 and should apply the same transition method elected for the application of ASU No. 2015-02. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and whether we will apply either the retrospective or modified-retrospective approach upon adoption.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments, which relates to how and when the acquiring entity recognizes adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period. This ASU eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for these adjustments to their respective provisional amount with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2015 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent in the classified statement of financial position. This ASU becomes effective for public entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and for all other entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity's accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. This ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017 and for all other entities beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, at the commencement date of each lease. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. This ASU is effective for all entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments of this update should be applied using a modified retrospective approach, which requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-04, Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products, which addresses the current and potential future diversity in practice related to the de-recognition of a prepaid stored-value product liability. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06, Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments, which addresses diversity in practice in assessing embedded contingent call or put options in debt instruments. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. This ASU should be applied using a modified retrospective approach to existing debt instruments as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which this ASU is effective. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This ASU was issued to provide more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and changes the loss impairment methodology. This ASU is effective for all entities for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 using a modified retrospective adoption method. A prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). This ASU was issued to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-entity transfers of Assets Other than Inventory. This ASU removes the current exception in U.S. GAAP prohibiting entities from recognizing current and deferred income tax expenses or benefits related to transfer of assets, other than inventory, within the consolidated entity. The current exception to defer the recognition of any tax impact on the transfer of inventory within the consolidated entity until it is sold to a third party remains unaffected. This ASU is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and for all other entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim reporting periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted and should be in the first interim period if an entity issues interim financial statements. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 320): Restricted Cash. This ASU clarifies the presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows as it will be included with cash and cash equivalents, which eliminates diversity in practice. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years and for all other entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This ASU clarifies the definition of a business, which consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs. This ASU provides a framework to evaluate when an input and a substantive process are present and narrows the definition of the term outputs to be consistent with how it is described in Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. When substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset, the assets acquired would not represent a business. This ASU introduces an initial required screen that, if met, eliminates the need for further assessment. This ASU is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods and for all other entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted.

This ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test and modifies the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. An entity no longer will determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. An entity should apply the amendments in this update on a prospective basis. This ASU is effective for public business entities for their annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, for public business entities that are not SEC filers for their annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and for all other entities for their annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.

MSRs are subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting period. The increase (decrease) in the fair value of our MSRs portfolio resulting from: (i) loans sold with servicing rights retained; (ii) the runoff of our MSRs portfolio including payoffs; and (iii) changes in fair valuation inputs and assumptions is included in changes in MSRs, net, in our consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the value of our MSRs increased by $12.4 million due to the $1.1 billion net increase in the unpaid principal balance of our MSRs portfolio, coupled with a $2.8 million increase in the fair value of MSRs resulting from the increase in mortgage interest rates during the year. From the date of acquisition through December 31, 2015, the fair value of our MSRs increased by $1.6 million primarily due to the $212.4 million net increase in the unpaid principal balance of our MSRs portfolio.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

In the first six months of 2016, the FASB issued amendments to this standard (ASU Nos. 2016-8, 2016-10, 2016-11, 2016-12 and 2016-20), which provide further clarification regarding this standard. ASU 2014-09 will replace certain existing revenue recognition guidance when it becomes effective. The original effective date of the guidance was deferred in August 2015 by the issuance of ASU No. 2015-14 and is effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period and for all other entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Management has commenced its implementation activities and determined that the following revenue streams are not impacted by or are excluded from the scope of this ASU: a) interest income, b) realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives, c) realized and unrealized gains on sale of mortgage loans held for sale, net of direct costs d) changes in mortgage servicing rights, net, e) loan servicing fees, and f) realized and unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities, net.

discount rates that range from 8.0% to 9.2%. The discount rate is either fixed over the term of the facility or is based on a fixed spread over a floating swap rate, which we then fix through interest rate swaps at the time of the borrowing. The discount rate is used to discount the payment streams we have purchased, and these discounted payment streams are then multiplied by the advance rate to determine the amount of funds that are available to us under the warehouse facilities.\nAdvertising expense consists of our marketing costs including television, internet, direct mail and other related expenses. Advertising expense for the five months ended December 31, 2015 included $0.7 million in costs associated with the re-branding of WestStar Mortgage Inc. as J.G. Wentworth Home Lending, Inc. (and ultimately J. G. Wentworth Home Lending, LLC) and the production costs for new television commercials that began to air in the third quarter of 2015.\nWe are focused on providing direct-to-consumer access to financing solutions through a variety of avenues, including: mortgage lending, structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment purchasing, prepaid cards, and access to providers of personal loans. Our direct-to-consumer businesses use digital channels, television, direct mail, and other channels to offer access to financing solutions. We warehouse, securitize, sell or otherwise finance the financial assets that we purchase in transactions that are structured to ultimately generate cash proceeds to us that exceed the purchase price we paid for those assets.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The J.G. Wentworth Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest, and those variable interest entities where our wholly-owned subsidiaries are the primary beneficiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 included the impact of $66.2 million decrease in restricted cash during the year that primarily related to the net effect of: (a) the timing of our 2014-3 securitization's pre-funding discussed previously and (b) our 2015-3 securitization being structured with only an initial close and not having an associated pre-funding component. The impact of the timing and structure of the 2014-3 and 2015-3 securitizations was a $71.8 million of a decrease to our restricted cash balance between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015.\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Structured Settlements Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(126,990\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(198,734\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(198,734\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(295,347\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(305.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home Lending Segment (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,717.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(98,015\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(197,140\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(197,140\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(293,753\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>304.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51,158\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(101,828\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(101,828\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(167,230\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income attributable to The J.G.

The $101.8 million net loss attributable to the non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2015 represents the non-controlling interests' 48.3% weighted average economic interest in JGW LLC's net income for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe, through our subsidiaries, sell finance receivables to SPEs. An SPE issues notes secured by undivided interests in the receivables. Payments due on these notes generally correspond to receipts from the receivables in terms of the timing of payments due. We retain an interest in the SPEs and are deemed to have control over these SPEs due to our servicing or subservicing role and therefore consolidate these SPEs.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity's accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. This ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017 and for all other entities beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\naggregate borrowing capacity were reduced to $295.0 million. In July 2016, we modified the terms of our $50.0 million warehouse facility and extended its maturity through January 2017. Under the terms of the revised facility agreement, the committed amount decreases by $5.0 million each month through maturity, starting in August 2016. In January 2017, we extended the renewal date of this facility from January 6, 2017 to February 5, 2017, at which time the line expired and was not renewed. In October 2016, we increased the capacity of our $50.0 million warehouse line of credit to $70.0 million and in January 2017, the capacity reverted to $50.0 million. In January 2017, we increased the capacity of our $75.0 million warehouse line of credit to $100.0 million and we extended the renewal date of our $95.0 million warehouse line of credit from February 10, 2017 to February 9, 2018. In March 2017, we canceled the $100.0 million warehouse line of credit that was scheduled to mature in September 2017. Also, in March 2017, we received a commitment of $50.0 million from a new lender for a warehouse line of credit on competitive terms. As of March 29, 2017, our borrowing facilities have an aggregate borrowing capacity of $295.0 million. We regularly assess our warehouse facilities and adjust the amount and the terms of our committed warehouse lines in light of market conditions.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Credit Facility requires us, to the extent that as of the last day of any fiscal quarter there are outstanding balances on the revolving commitment that exceed specific thresholds (generally 15% of the $20.0 million borrowing capacity, or $3.0 million), to comply with a maximum total leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving commitment, and, as a result, the maximum total leverage ratio requirement was not applicable. Had the leverage ratio requirement been applicable as of December 31, 2016, we would not have satisfied the maximum total leverage ratio requirement and would have been required to repay the outstanding borrowings on the revolver in excess of the specified threshold.\nExpenses\nServicing, broker and other fees represent revenue recognized for servicing mortgage loans for various investors that are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance. The primary driver of our servicing revenue is our MSRs portfolio. The outstanding unpaid principal balance of serviced mortgages was $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.1 billion from the prior year unpaid principal balance of serviced mortgages of $3.0 billion.\nHome Lending\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when the following conditions have been satisfied: (1) the transferred assets have been isolated from the Company, beyond the reach of the Company and its creditors; (2) the transferee obtains the right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets; and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity, or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets or through an agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them. Transfers that do not meet the criteria to be accounted for as sales are accounted for as secured borrowings.\nJGW LLC and the majority of its subsidiaries operate in the U.S. as non-tax paying entities, and are treated as disregarded entities for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes and generally as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, certain of JGW LLC's wholly-owned subsidiaries are operating as corporations within the U.S. and subject to U.S. federal and state tax. As non-tax paying entities, the majority of JGW LLC's net income or loss is attributable to its members and included in their tax returns. The current and deferred income tax provision (benefit) relates to both the income (loss) attributable to the Corporation from JGW LLC and to the tax-paying subsidiaries of JGW LLC.\nRealized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt, and derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was comprised of the following:\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06, Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments, which addresses diversity in practice in assessing embedded contingent call or put options in debt instruments. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. This ASU should be applied using a modified retrospective approach to existing debt instruments as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which this ASU is effective. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nWe finance our mortgage loan origination activities primarily through five separate warehouse facilities that had an aggregate capacity of $365.0 million as of December 31, 2016. Subsequent to year-end, our borrowing facilities and the current\nOperating Line of Credit\nCompensation and benefits includes salaries for Home Lending employees, commissions paid to loan officers, applicable taxes and the cost of providing employee benefits. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Home Lending recorded severance charges of $0.5 million related primarily to the departure of two former owners of the acquired entity.\nInterest expense represents interest on Home Lending's: (i) five warehouse credit facilities with various financial institutions used to originate mortgage loans held for sale that had a combined maximum borrowing capacity of $365.0 million as of December 31, 2016; and (ii) a single operating line of credit, which is collateralized by our MSRs, with a maximum borrowing capacity of $10.0 million as of December 31, 2016.\nIn evaluating performance, we net the gains on mortgage loans sold, unrealized gains on mortgage loans held for sale, interest rate lock commitments (\"IRLCs\"), and associated derivative instruments (i.e., forward sale commitments to deliver mortgage loans and forward sales of MBS) resulting from fair value mark-to-market adjustments, with direct costs such as fees paid to third parties to originate and sell the associated mortgage loans, and present it as realized and unrealized gains on sale of\nConsolidation\nOn September 2, 2016, the Company issued $207.5 million in notes collateralized by the residual asset cash flows and reserve cash interests related to 36 VIE securitization entities, which generated $65.9 million in net cash proceeds. The Company incurred $2.6 million of debt issuance costs which were included in debt issuance expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The Company acts as the servicer and/or the subservicer and principal and interest are paid monthly from the cash flows from these collateralized residual interests.\nThe $4.9 million increase in accretion income on finance receivables was primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding securitized finance receivables balance partially offset by a decrease in the average fair value discount rates used to calculate interest income on the associated securitized assets during the periods. The $1.3 million decrease in interest income on pre-settlement funding transaction receivables was due to a reduction in the associated VIE and other finance receivables resulting from management's decision to curtail purchases of such assets in April 2015.\nHome Lending Segment\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\n\nAs a consequence of the initial sales and any future exchanges of Common Interests for shares of our Class A common stock or Class C common stock, we may increase our share of the tax basis of the assets then owned by JGW LLC. Any such increase in tax basis is anticipated to allow us the ability to reduce the amount of future tax payments to the extent that we have future taxable income. We are obligated, pursuant to our tax receivable agreement with all Common Interestholders who held in excess of approximately 1% of the Common Interests as of immediately prior to our IPO, to pay to such Common Interestholders 85% of the amount of income tax we save for each tax period as a result of the tax benefits generated from the initial sales and any subsequent exchange of Common Interests for our Class A common stock or Class C common stock and from the use of certain tax attributes. We expect to fund these long-term requirements under the tax receivable agreement with tax distributions received from JGW LLC and, if necessary, loans from JGW LLC.\n (b) Certain of our contractual obligations and commitments are funded through cash flows from certain VIE finance receivables included on our consolidated balance sheets. \nExpenses\nWe recorded a consolidated income tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2016 of $15.3 million compared to a benefit of $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our overall effective tax rate was 13.5% for the year ended\nWe qualify as an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and do, rely on exemptions from certain financial disclosure requirements under U.S. GAAP that are not applicable to other companies that are not emerging growth companies. In particular, we can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards which allows us to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We took advantage of the extended transition period as permitted under JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nComparison of Structured Settlements Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nWe have (i) a widely syndicated senior secured term loan with a principal balance of $449.5 million as of December 31, 2016 which matures in February 2019, and (ii) a $20.0 million revolving commitment that matures in August 2017. At each interest reset date, we have the option to elect that the senior secured term loan be either a Eurodollar loan or a Base Rate loan. If a Eurodollar loan, interest accrues at either Libor or 1.0% (whichever is greater) plus a spread of 6.0%. If a Base Rate loan, interest accrues at prime or 2.0% (whichever is greater) plus a spread of 5.0%. The revolving commitment has the same interest rate terms as the senior secured term loan. There are no principal payments due on the senior secured term loan until its maturity in February 2019.\nAdvertising expense, which consists of our marketing costs including television, internet, direct mail and other related expenses, decreased to $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a $13.2 million decrease in our television spend that was partially offset by a $4.7 million net increase in our internet, direct mailing, and other advertising expenses. We continually assess the effectiveness of our advertising initiatives and adjust the timing, investment and advertising channels on an ongoing basis.\nDecember 31, 2014. The $6.3 million increase was primarily attributable to: (i) a $4.2 million increase in interest expense associated with our VIE securitized debt that resulted from an increase in the average outstanding balance between periods, partially offset by a decrease in the interest rate used to calculate interest expense and (ii) a $1.9 million increase in interest expense associated with our VIE long term debt that was principally due an increase in the average outstanding balance of our residual term debt and an increase and in the corresponding interest rate. In August 2015, we amended our residual term loan to increase the principal amount outstanding by $25.0 million to $133.0 million. In connection with the amendment, the interest rate increased from 7.00% to 7.25%.\nWe have intangible assets which have indefinite and finite lives, which are accounted for under ASC 350. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's carrying value may not be fully recoverable, and are tested at least annually. An impairment loss, calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset, is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset is less than the corresponding carrying value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of licenses and approvals.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nAdvertising expense, which consists of our marketing costs including television, internet, direct mail and other related expenses, decreased to $44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to a $10.0 million decrease in our television spend and a $5.1 million decrease in our internet, direct mailing, and other advertising expenses. These actions were part of our previously announced plan to turn around the Structured Settlements segment in part by overhauling our media spend. We continually assess the effectiveness of our advertising initiatives and adjust the timing, investment and advertising channels on an ongoing basis.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent in the classified statement of financial position. This ASU becomes effective for public entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and for all other entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nThe $0.1 million loss on interest rate swaps related to warehouse facilities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of the termination of interest rate swaps with a notional value of $61.1 million that were executed as part of our strategy to hedge interest rate risk. The $0.6 million loss on interest rate swaps related to warehouse facilities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was the result of the termination of interest rate swaps with a notional value of $46.5 million that were executed as part of our strategy to hedge interest rate risk.\nThe Company had a Residual Term Facility that was secured by the cash flows from our residual interests in 28 securitizations and was structured with a $133.0 million A1 Note that was due in May 2021. The interest rate on the Residual Term Facility was 7.25%. The Residual Term Facility did not require minimum annual principal payments.\nLoan origination fee income earned during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $9.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively, which represents revenue earned from originating mortgage loans and generally represents flat, per loan fee amounts.\nStructured Settlements Segment\nComparison of Structured Settlements Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\n(1) Includes activity since the acquisition of Home Lending on July 31, 2015.\n (d) Long-term debt does not include $5.4 million of debt associated with our Long-Term Pre-Settlement Facility which has no stated maturity date. \nfacilities or obtain new financing facilities.\nOther Financing\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nLotteries\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, based on review of our projections for our Structures Settlements segment based on lower than anticipated results, a significant decline in the stock price of our Class A common stock, and a re-assessment of the reporting unit's brand strategy, we recorded impairment charges of $121.6 million comprised of the following: (i) an $85.0 million write-down of goodwill, (ii) a $35.5 million write-down of the indefinite-lived trade name, and (iii) a $1.1 million write-down of other intangible assets.\nLife Contingent Structured Settlements and Life Contingent Annuities\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $215.4 million, a decrease of $54.2 million, or 20.1%, from $269.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $62.8 million unfavorable change in realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives, partially offset by an $8.7 million increase in realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities, net.\n\nWe maintain a $10.0 million line of credit with a financial institution that is generally renewed annually for a period of 12 months and represents a secured lending facility with our MSRs serving as collateral. In August 2016, we increased the capacity of this line of credit to $10.0 million from $6.0 million and extended the maturity date through June 16, 2017. The Company may only draw on $4.0 million of the capacity until we receive regulatory approval.\n \u2022 Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date. \nThese warehouse facilities are used strictly to fund the guaranteed structured settlement and annuity payment stream purchases. Our ability to fund current operations depends upon our ability to secure these types of short-term financings on acceptable terms and to renew or replace the financings as they expire. While we historically have been able to regularly renew the warehouse facilities in the ordinary course of business, we cannot assure that we will be able to renew, replace or refinance our existing financing arrangements or enter into additional financing arrangements on terms that are commercially reasonable or at all. In addition, a negative ratings action by a rating agency, an adverse action by a regulatory authority or a general deterioration in the economy that constricts the availability of credit may increase our cost of funds and may impair our ability to renew existing\nTotal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $357.7 million, a decrease of $129.3 million, or 26.5%, from expenses of $487.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTotal realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables represent: (i) unrealized gains and losses on finance receivables acquired from customers prior to their securitization and (ii) realized gains and losses on finance receivables acquired from customers resulting from their inclusion in direct asset sale transactions.\nThese warehouse facilities are used strictly to fund the origination of mortgage loans. Our ability to fund current operations depends upon our ability to secure these types of short-term financings on acceptable terms and to renew or replace the financings as they expire. These warehouse facilities are uncommitted and, at any given time, we may not be able to obtain additional financing under them when we need it, exposing us to, among other things, liquidity risks of the types described in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. While we historically have been able to regularly renew the warehouse facilities in the ordinary course of business, we cannot assure that we will be able to renew, replace or refinance our existing financing arrangements or enter into additional financing arrangements on terms that are commercially reasonable or at all. In addition, a negative ratings action by a rating agency, an adverse action by a regulatory authority or a general deterioration in the economy that constricts the availability of credit may increase our cost of funds and may impair our ability to renew existing facilities or obtain new financing facilities.\nStructured Settlements and Annuities\n (c) On September 2, 2016, we permanently financed the residual asset cash flows and reserve cash associated with 36 of the Company's securitizations with outstanding principle balances. The debt is now classified as Long-term debt issued by securitizations and permanent financing trusts, whereas in the prior year, the debt was classified as Long-term debt. \nIn 2013, we began purchasing lottery payment streams and have structured one of our two remaining guaranteed structured settlement and annuity warehouse facilities to allow us to finance lottery payment streams. This allows us to aggregate a pool of such payment streams that we subsequently include with structured settlement and annuity payment streams in securitizations and direct asset sales. We intend to continue to include lottery payment streams in securitizations and direct asset sales in the future.\nResults of Operations\nTax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and evaluating tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties under U.S. GAAP. Management reviews its tax positions periodically and adjusts its tax balances as new information becomes available.\nThe $102.0 million decrease in our loss before income taxes was principally due to a $75.0 million decrease in our pre-tax loss from our Structured Settlements segment that was the result of: (i) $121.6 million in impairment charges recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $5.5 million in impairment charges recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 and (ii) a $15.1 million decrease in advertising expense as part of our previously announced cost-saving initiatives, partially offset by a $62.8 million unfavorable change in realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long term debt and derivatives driven by lower TRB purchases and a decrease in realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables. The decrease in Structured Settlements' pre-tax loss was coupled with an increase of $27.0 million in pre-tax income generated by our Home Lending segment that was driven by growth in interest rate lock volume of approximately $4.0 billion due in part to the low interest rate environment and as a result of only five months of Home Lending's results of operations being included in the Company's consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe $3.1 million loss on termination of interest rate swaps related to securitized debt during the year ended December 31, 2016 represents the loss on the termination of interest rate swaps related to the Peachtree Structured Settlements, LLC (\"PSS\") securitized debt that had a notional value of $13.8 million. There was no loss on the termination of interest rate swaps related to securitized debt during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe maintain other permanent financing arrangements that have been used in the past for longer term funding purposes. Each of these arrangements has assets pledged as collateral, the cash flows from which are used to satisfy the loan obligations. These other financing arrangements are more fully described in Notes 18 and 19 in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under \"Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data'\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nCompensation and benefits expense decreased to $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an $8.1 million decrease in salaries, commissions and payroll taxes that resulted from a combination of lower headcount and lower commissions due to lower TRB purchase volume in the current year compared to the prior year.\nThe debt issued by our securitization VIEs is reported on our consolidated balance sheets as VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts, at fair value (\"VIE securitization debt\"). The VIE securitization debt is recourse solely to the VIE finance receivables held by such SPEs and is non-recourse to us and our other consolidated subsidiaries. The VIEs will continue in operation until all securitization debt is paid and all residual cash flows are collected. As a result of the long lives of many finance receivables purchased and securitized by us, most consolidated VIEs have expected lives in excess of 20 years.\nWe regularly assess our warehouse facilities and adjust the nature and amount of our committed warehouse lines in light of market conditions. Based on current and projected financing needs, we terminated a $50.0 million and a $300.0 million warehouse facility in January 2016 and May 2016, respectively. Subsequent to these terminations, our total borrowing capacity under our warehouse facilities is $400.0 million. We intend to renew or replace the two remaining guaranteed structured settlement and annuity warehouse facilities prior to the end of their respective revolving periods to better reflect our financing needs in the future.\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nWe utilize a number of different funding sources to finance our segments and their associated business activities.\n\nProfessional and consulting costs decreased to $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $7.9 million decrease was primarily due to third-party fees incurred in connection with the 2015 acquisition of Home Lending and an overall decrease in the use of outside consultants as part of our cost-savings initiatives.\nThe $1.5 million loss on interest rate swaps related to warehouse facilities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was the result of the termination of interest rate swaps with a notional value of $75.2 million that were executed as part of our strategy to hedge interest rate risk. The $0.1 million loss on interest rate swaps related to warehouse facilities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of the termination of interest rate swaps with a notional value of $61.1 million that were executed as part of our strategy to hedge interest rate risk.\nThe amendments to ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing (\"ASC 860\"), eliminated the concept of a qualified special purpose entity, changed the requirements for derecognizing financial assets, and required additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions and continuing involvement with transferred financial assets.\n(1) Home Lending was acquired on July 31, 2015, and, therefore, the results for the year ended December 31, 2015 include only two months of Home Lending's operations.\nInterest income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was comprised of the following:\nThe $4.6 million increase in accretion income on finance receivables was primarily due to an increase in the average fair value discount rate used to calculate interest income on the associated securitized assets, partially offset by a decrease in our average outstanding securitized finance receivables balance during the periods. The $4.0 million decrease in interest income on pre-settlement funding transaction receivables was due to a reduction in the associated VIE and other finance receivables resulting from management's decision to curtail purchases of such assets in April 2015.\nWe intend, subject to market conditions, management discretion and other relevant factors, to undertake multiple securitizations or direct asset sales in the future. Although diversifying our financing strategy allows us to realize greater cost efficiencies in our capital market transactions and provides us with increased flexibility, we still believe the asset-backed securities market has been and continues to be the Company's principal market.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nIn establishing accounting policies within the framework of U.S. GAAP, management must make certain assessments, estimates, and choices that will result in the application of these principals in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies and estimates that we consider to be critical.\nWe finance our guaranteed structured settlement and annuity payment stream purchases with available cash and cash equivalents and/or through two separate warehouse facilities. As of December 31, 2016, these two warehouse facilities had $400.0 million of aggregate capacity which consisted of: (i) a $300.0 million syndicated warehouse facility with a revolving period that ends in July 2017 and (ii) a $100.0 million warehouse facility with a revolving period that ends in May 2018. Subsequent to the expiration or termination of their respective revolving lines of credit, our warehouse facilities have amortization periods of four months ($300.0 million facility) or 18 months ($100.0 million facility) before final maturity, allowing us time to exit or refinance the warehouse facility after the revolving period has ended. As of December 31, 2016, we had $343.6 million in total unused borrowing capacity across the two separate warehouse facilities used to finance our guaranteed structured settlement and annuity payment stream purchases.\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved with various entities that are considered to be VIEs. A VIE is an entity that has either a total investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest under the voting interest model of consolidation. We are required to consolidate any VIE if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has the power to direct those activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses from or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We review all significant interests in the VIEs we are involved with including consideration of the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance and whether we have control over those activities. As a result of adopting ASC 810, we determined we were the primary beneficiary of the VIEs used to securitize our finance receivables (\"VIE finance receivables\"). We elected the fair value option with respect to assets and liabilities in our securitization VIEs as part of their initial consolidation on January 1, 2010.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). This ASU was issued to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nComparison of Home Lending Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\n2016 Highlights\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 included the impact of a $66.2 million decrease in restricted cash during the year that primarily related to the net effect of: (i) the timing of 2014-3 securitization's initial close occurring in the fourth quarter of 2014 but the associated pre-funding occurring in the first quarter of 2015 and (ii) our 2015-3 securitization being structured with only an initial close and not having an associated pre-funding. The impact of the timing and structure of the 2014-3 and 2015-3 securitizations was a $71.8 million decrease in our restricted cash balance between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-04, Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products, which addresses the current and potential future diversity in practice related to the de-recognition of a prepaid stored-value product liability. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we re-evaluated our projections for our Structured Settlements segment based on lower than anticipated results, a significant decline in the stock price of our Class A common stock, and a re-assessment of the reporting unit's brand strategy. Accordingly, we determined these events constituted a triggering event requiring us to test the goodwill and finite and indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the 2011 acquisition of OAC for potential impairment. As a result of this analysis, we determined in the third quarter that the trade name within the reporting unit was impaired and recorded a $29.9 million impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRealized and unrealized (losses) gains on marketable securities, net, was a $4.6 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, an unfavorable change from the $0.9 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to lower investment returns on marketable securities. The decrease was primarily offset by a corresponding decrease in installment obligations (income) expense, net. These amounts relate to the marketable securities and installment obligations payable on our consolidated balance sheets. The marketable securities are owned by us but are held to fully offset our installment obligations liability. Therefore, increases or decreases in gains on marketable securities do not impact our net income.\n\nThe change in our net (loss) income before income taxes was principally due to a $335.1 million decline in pre-tax income from our Structured Settlements segment that was the result of: (i) a $221.1 million decrease in realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long term debt and derivatives driven by: (a) an unfavorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows, (b) lower TRB purchases, and (c) a decrease in the current year's discount rate applied to TRB purchases, and (ii) the current year's impairment charges totaling $121.6 million to reduce the segment's goodwill and intangible assets to their respective fair values. Our Home Lending segment, which we acquired on July 31, 2015, generated pre-tax income of $2.0 million in 2015.\nWe currently operate our business through two business segments: (i) Structured Settlements and (ii) Home Lending. Our Structured Settlements segment provides liquidity to customers by purchasing structured settlements, annuities and lottery winnings. Structured Settlements also includes corporate activities, payment solutions, pre-settlements and providing (i) access to providers of personal lending and (ii) access to providers of funding for pre-settled legal claims. Our Home Lending segment specializes in originating, selling and servicing residential mortgage loans.\nWe decided, beginning in April 2015, to curtail our purchases of pre-settlement transactions. We have, however, and will continue to broker leads for such transactions to third parties in exchange for broker or referral fees, and, in the normal course of our business, will evaluate our existing pool of pre-settlement assets for retention or sale. Ceasing purchases of pre-settlement transactions has not had a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.\n(1) Includes activity since the acquisition of Home Lending on July 31, 2015.\nmortgage loans held for sale, net of direct costs, in our consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated $82.2 million in gross revenue from the sale of mortgage loans and netted against it $7.1 million in direct costs, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, when we generated $20.5 million in gross revenue from the sale of mortgage loans and netted against it $1.9 million in direct costs.\n \u2022 Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable, reflecting the entity's own assumptions about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the assets or owes the liabilities rather than an entity specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities at the measurement date. We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We also evaluate various factors to determine whether certain transactions are orderly and may make adjustments to transactions or quoted prices when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have decreased significantly.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe $0.6 million gain on extinguishment of securitized debt during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from the early repayment of the 2004-A securitization debt issued by Structured Receivables Finance #1, LLC. The associated finance receivables subsequently were included in the 2015-1 securitization. There was no gain on extinguishment of securitized debt during the year ended December 31, 2016.\n \u2022 Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices in markets that are not active or quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. \nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This ASU was issued to provide more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and changes the loss impairment methodology. This ASU is effective for all entities for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 using a modified retrospective adoption method. A prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nComparison of Consolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nOverview\nIncome Taxes\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which requires an entity to re-evaluate its consolidation for limited partnerships or similar entities. This ASU requires an entity to apply this amendment using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period of adoption. This ASU changes the criteria that an entity uses to identify a variable interest entity, how it characterizes the VIE for a limited partnership or similar entity and how it determines the primary beneficiary. For public entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and for nonpublic entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control, which further clarified ASU No. 2015-02. This update amends the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a VIE should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. Entities that have not yet adopted the amendments in ASU No. 2015-02 are required to adopt the amendments in ASU 2016-17 at the same time they adopt the amendments in ASU No. 2015-02 and should apply the same transition method elected for the application of ASU No. 2015-02. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and whether we will apply either the retrospective or modified-retrospective approach upon adoption.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $125.7 million and $399.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The cash used in operating activities does not reflect the financing of our purchased receivables which is an integral part of our Structured Settlements segment and is reflected in net cash provided by financing activities. The $274.1 million decrease in the net cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to: (i) a $155.1 million decrease related to changes in restricted cash and investments primarily due to the timing and structure of securitizations in the fourth quarters of 2015, 2014 and 2013, (ii) a $54.1 million decrease in purchases of finance receivables, (iii) a $27.0 increase in collections on finance receivables, (iv) a $24.6 million decrease resulting from the Home Lending segment's proceeds from the sale and principal payments on mortgage loans held for sale (net of originations and purchases of mortgages\nThe decrease in debt issuance costs from the prior year was due to a $1.9 million reduction in underwriting fees resulting from the lower volume of securitized debt issued in the current year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued approximately $475.9 million in securitized debt, a decrease of $193.1 million from the approximately $669.0 million in securitized debt issued in 2014. Underwriting fees associated with our securitizations are calculated as a percentage of the principal amount of debt issued.\nCredit Facility\nin tax positions exist, a reserve will be established. We will recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our consolidated statements of operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the \"Risk Factors\" and the \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nNewly acquired finance receivable assets are accounted for at fair value until they are securitized or disposed of pursuant to a direct asset sale. Subsequent to acquisition but prior to securitization or sale, the Company generally borrows against purchased finance receivables pursuant to one of its revolving credit facilities. When the Company borrows against its finance receivables, it transfers the encumbered assets into a VIE. If the finance receivables are securitized, immediately prior to securitization, the securitized assets are adjusted to their current fair value and the resulting change in fair value is included in gains/(losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one. If the finance receivables are included in a direct asset sale, the previously recognized unrealized gains/(losses) are reversed and the difference between the purchase price and sales price is recorded as a realized gain and included in gains/(losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one. The difference between the price paid to acquire finance receivables and their fair value at the end of the month acquired is referred to as \"day one gains\". Changes in fair value of finance receivables acquired in prior months are referred to as \"gains (losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one\".\nMortgage Loans Held For Sale\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nComparison of Consolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test. The results of the analysis indicated an additional impairment of the trade name as well as an impairment of the goodwill within the reporting unit. Consequently, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $91.7 million in the fourth quarter comprised of the following: (i) an $85.0 million write-down of goodwill, (ii) an additional $5.6 million write-down of the indefinite-lived trade name, and (iii) a $1.1 million write-down of other intangible assets. While we believe our assumptions used in the determination of the asset's fair value are reasonable, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Less than anticipated revenues generated by the remaining intangible assets, an increase in discount rates, and/or a decrease in our projected growth rates used in the discounted cash flow model could result in future impairment charges.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of the two reportable Segments' Net Loss to Net Loss Attributable to The J.G. Wentworth Company for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nWe finance our purchases of life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams through a committed permanent financing facility with a capacity of $100.0 million that can be increased at the lender's by $50.0 million. This facility allows us to purchase life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams without assuming any mortality risk. This facility is structured as a permanent facility, whereby the life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams we purchase are financed for their entire life and remain within the facility until maturity. The payment streams purchased are funded at a fixed advance rate of 94%, while the discount rate used to value the payment streams is variable, depending on the characteristics of the payment streams. The life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams that we purchase are discounted at a higher rate than the discount rates applied to those payment streams under the committed permanent financing facility, with the result that the funds available to be drawn under the facility exceed the purchase price for the payment streams we purchase. This positive cash flow is used to support our business and cover a portion of our operating expenses. As of December 31, 2016, our permanent financing facility had $17.0 million of unused capacity for our life contingent annuity and structured settlement businesses.\nFunding Sources\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $42.5 million and $(125.7) million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash provided by (used in) operating activities does not reflect the financing of our purchased receivables, which is an integral part of our Structured Settlements segment and is reflected in net cash (used in) provided by financing activities. In 2016, based on market conditions, we completed one securitization and two direct asset sales resulting in five monetization events. The $168.2 million increase in the net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to: (i) a $249.4 million increase in net proceeds from the sale of finance receivables due to management's decision to complete more direct assets sales in 2016 as compared to 2015, (ii) a $122.7 million decrease in purchases of finance receivables reflecting lower TRB purchase volume in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, (iii) a $125.0 million change in restricted cash and investments due to the timing and structure of monetization events in the fourth quarters of 2016, 2015 and 2014, (iv) a $58.5 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities resulting from the Home Lending segment's originations and purchases of mortgages held for sale (net of proceeds from the sale of and principal payments on mortgage loans held for sale), and (v) a $22.7 million decrease in the collections on finance receivables.\nTotal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $487.0 million, an increase of $110.4 million, or 29.3%, from expenses of $376.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDecember 31, 2015. The $11.4 million increase was primarily attributable to a $11.3 million increase in interest expense associated with our VIE securitized debt that resulted from an increase in the average outstanding balance between periods, coupled with an increase in the interest rate used to calculate interest expense.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we re-evaluated our projections for our Structured Settlements segment based on lower than anticipated results that were included in the prior year's annual impairment test and a continued decline in the stock price of our Class A common stock. Accordingly, we determined these events constituted a triggering event requiring the Company to test the indefinite-lived trade name and finite-lived customer-relationships intangible assets acquired in connection with the 2011 acquisition of OAC for potential impairment. As a result of this analysis, we determined the trade name and the customer-relationships intangible assets within the Structured Settlements reporting unit were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $5.5 million in our consolidated statements of operations. The $5.5 million impairment charge was comprised of the following: (i) a $2.8 million write-down of the trade name and (ii) a $2.7 million write-down of the finite-lived customer relationships. We also determined that the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets within the Structured Settlements reporting unit were less than previously assigned and consequently revised them to their currently estimated useful lives of approximately three years. We also determined in connection with this analysis that the trade name is a finite-lived asset.\nConsolidated Liquidity Needs\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $269.6 million, a decrease of $224.7 million, or 45.5%, from revenues of $494.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $221.1 million decrease in realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives and a $5.5 million increase in realized and unrealized losses on marketable securities.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nUnder ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure (\"ASC 820\"), fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurement establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value. These three levels of fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 included the impact of an $88.9 million increase in restricted cash that primarily related to the net effect of the following: (a) both 2013-3 securitization's initial close and pre-funding occurring in the fourth quarter of 2013 and (b) our 2014-3 securitization's initial close occurring in the fourth quarter of 2014 but the associated pre-funding occurring in the first quarter of 2015. As a result of the timing of the 2013-3 and 2014-3 pre-fundings, restricted cash increased $71.8 million between December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.\n\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $(11.0) million and $191.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $202.9 million change was primarily attributable to: (i) a $177.0 million decrease in proceeds received from the issuance of VIE long-term debt resulting from our decision to complete two direct asset sales and one securitization in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to three securitization transactions and one direct asset sale in the year ended December 31, 2015, and includes the impact of the issuance of $207.5 million of notes payable collateralized by the residual asset cash flows and reserve cash related to 36 of our securitizations, and (ii) a $133.5 million increase in repayments of long-term debt and derivatives primarily related to the $131.4 million repayment in September 2016 of our previous $133.0 million residual term facility (\"Residual Term Facility\"), partially offset by (i) a $93.6 million increase in proceeds (net of repayments) from our revolving credit facilities and (ii) a $14.5 million reduction in purchases of treasury stock.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments (excluding interest rate swaps which are discussed in \"Derivatives and Other Hedging Instruments\") as of December 31, 2016, and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. The table also reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding debt based on scheduled and/or expected repayment dates and the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2016. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as referenced in the table:\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe acquire receivables associated with structured settlement payments from individuals in exchange for cash, and these receivables are carried at fair value in VIE finance receivables, at fair value, and Other finance receivables, at fair value, on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Unearned income is calculated as the amount the fair value exceeds the cost basis of the receivables. Unearned income on VIE and other finance receivables is recognized as interest income using the effective interest method over the life of the related structured settlement. Changes in fair value are recorded in realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long- term debt and derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations.\n (a) Included in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereof. \n\nRealized and unrealized gains on marketable securities, net, was a $4.1 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2016, a favorable change from the $4.6 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to higher investment returns on marketable securities. The increase was primarily offset by a corresponding increase in installment obligations expense (income), net. These amounts relate to the marketable securities and installment obligations payable on our consolidated balance sheets. The marketable securities are owned by us but are held to fully offset our installment obligations liability. Therefore, increases or decreases in gains on marketable securities do not impact our net income.\n\nThe net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interests represents the portion of (loss) earnings attributable to the economic interests in JGW LLC held by the non-controlling Common Interestholders. The $101.8 million net loss attributable to non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2015 represents the non-controlling interests' 48.3% weighted average economic interest in JGW LLC's net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $65.4 million net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2014 represents the non-controlling interests' 55.7% weighted average economic interest in JGW LLC's net income for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense, which includes interest on our securitization and other VIE long-term debt, warehouse facilities and our term loan, increased by 5.5% to $218.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $207.1 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016 compared to an overall effective rate of 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the overall effective tax rate was due primarily to the impact of the $121.6 million impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets recorded in 2015 and the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $11.9 million in 2016 due to the uncertainty that it will fully benefit from the losses incurred during the current and prior years. The Company is recording certain deferred tax liabilities as it is now required to file tax returns in jurisdictions where it has no offsetting loss carryforwards.\nThe $2.1 million decrease in realized gains on notes receivable, at fair value resulted from the repayment of a note receivable during the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nTotal realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $55.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease of $263.5 million, or 27.0%, in guaranteed and life contingent structured settlement, annuity and lottery TRB purchases, from $976.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $713.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe $1.8 million increase in unrealized losses on securitized finance receivables, debt and derivatives was primarily the result of: (i) a $9.4 million unfavorable change in the unrealized gain (loss) on the securitized finance receivables, debt and derivatives associated with the Peachtree Structured Settlements LLC permanent financing facility primarily due to an early amortization event that occurred during the first quarter of 2016 which resulted in future excess cash flows being applied to the prepayment of the outstanding debt and derivatives and (ii) a $9.1 million unfavorable change in the unrealized gain (loss) on other securitized finance receivables (other than the associated residual interests), securitized debt and derivatives resulting principally from movements in the fair value discount rates used to value these items, partially offset by a $16.7 million favorable change in the unrealized loss on our residual interests as a result of movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.\nCash Flows\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This ASU clarifies the definition of a business, which consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs. This ASU provides a framework to evaluate when an input and a substantive process are present and narrows the definition of the term outputs to be consistent with how it is described in Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. When substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset, the assets acquired would not represent a business. This ASU introduces an initial required screen that, if met, eliminates the need for further assessment. This ASU is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods and for all other entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nTotal realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables represent: (i) unrealized gains and losses on finance receivables acquired from customers prior to their securitization and (ii) realized gains and losses on finance receivables acquired from customers resulting from their inclusion in direct asset sale transactions.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 320): Restricted Cash. This ASU clarifies the presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows as it will be included with cash and cash equivalents, which eliminates diversity in practice. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years and for all other entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe $160.8 million change in unrealized (losses) gains on securitized finance receivables, debt and derivatives was primarily the result of: (i) an unfavorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a favorable movement in the associated fair value interest rate during the year ended December 31, 2014. Specifically, the discount rate used to fair value our residual interests increased from 5.97% as of December 31, 2014 to 8.30% as of December 31, 2015 as result of the widening of spreads in the asset-backed securities market during 2015. In comparison, the discount rate used to fair value our residual interests decreased from 7.85% as of December 31, 2013 to 5.97% at December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of both the decrease in spreads in the asset-backed securities market and in long term interest rates in general during 2014, both of which are used in the calculation of the fair value discount rate used to estimate the fair value of our residual interest cash flows.\nThe Company generates cash by purchasing payment streams which we subsequently securitize, sell or otherwise finance in transactions that are structured to generate cash proceeds to us that exceed the purchase price we paid for those payment streams. For Structured Settlements these payment streams are generally structured settlements, annuities and lottery winnings. For Home Lending we purchase mortgage loans and sell these loans with servicing retained or released.\nWe have historically undertaken non-recourse term securitizations or direct asset sales once we have aggregated in our warehouse facilities a sufficient amount of structured settlement and annuity payment streams to undertake a securitization. At the close of each such transaction, the outstanding amount under each of the warehouse facilities is repaid. The amount of net proceeds we receive from securitizations or direct asset sales is typically in excess of the amount of funds required to repay the warehouse facilities, resulting in a positive cash flow at the time of securitization. In 2016, we completed five monetization events that consisted of two direct asset sales (each consisting of an initial close and prefunding transaction) and the initial close of a securitization. The first direct asset sale consisted of $161.3 million in discounted TRB purchases based on a deal discount rate of 5.02% and was comprised of two asset pools. The first pool, which closed on February 18, 2016, consisted of $91.3 million in discounted TRB purchases and generated net proceeds to us of $27.0 million. The second pool, which closed on April 21, 2016, consisted of $70.0 million in discounted TRB purchases and generated net proceeds to us of $21.6 million. The second direct asset sale in 2016 consisted of $110.8 million in discounted TRB purchases and was also comprised of two asset pools. The first pool, which closed on June 17, 2016, consisted of $50.8 million in discounted TRB purchases based on a deal discount rate of 4.85% and generated net proceeds to us of $18.2 million. The second pool, which closed on August 19, 2016, consisted of $59.2 million in discounted TRB purchases and generated net proceeds to us of $20.1 million. On October 26, 2016, we completed the initial close associated with our 2016-1 securitization with an aggregate note issuance amount of $117.3 million and a deal discount rate of 3.89% which generated net proceeds to us of $16.5 million. On January 20, 2017, we completed the pre-funding associated with the 2016-1 securitization which generated net proceeds to us of $15.9 million. On March 22, 2017, we completed the initial close associated with our 2017-1 securitization with an aggregate note issuance amount of $131.8 million and a deal discount rate of 4.35% which generated net proceeds to us of $15.1 million.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe above conditions could cause certain assets and liabilities to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 3 or reclassified from Level 2 to Level 3. The inputs or methodology used for valuing the assets or liabilities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with the assets and liabilities.\nQuarterly Financial Data\nInterest expense, which includes interest on our securitization and other VIE long-term debt, warehouse facilities and our term loan, increased by 3.1% to $207.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $200.8 million for the year ended\n\nIn the first half of 2016, we focused on improving performance of our Structured Settlements business, maintaining adequate liquidity through funding source optimization and rigorous expense controls while continuing to grow our Home Lending business. Within our Structured Settlements business, we completed our turnaround strategy in our marketing and operations functions which enabled us to reduce costs while achieving higher conversion rates. During the second half of 2016, we concentrated on continuing to grow our market share in the Home Lending business through operational scale while focusing on capital market execution and anticipating changes in the interest rate environment. Our Home Lending business achieved record closed loan volume originations of $3.4 billion as a result of our strong affinity relationships that leveraged the strength of our brand name. We continued to access the capital markets through the execution of a securitization of our structured settlements assets and completed direct asset sales to extract what we believe was the maximum profitability based on current market conditions and underlying economics. During 2016, we completed the initial close and subsequent pre-funding transactions associated with two direct asset sales generating an aggregate of $87.0 million in net cash proceeds and the initial close associated with a securitization transaction which generated $17.6 million in net cash proceeds. In addition, we issued $207.5 million in notes collateralized by the residual asset cash flows and reserve cash associated with 36 of the Company's previously executed securitizations, which generated $65.9 million in net cash proceeds. Our payment solutions group also expanded its channels and offerings to include solutions for the lottery and gaming industries. As of December 31, 2016, our payment solutions group was still in the early stage of development and had not generated significant revenues.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in the business combination, and is accounted for under ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC 350\"). Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment at the reporting-unit level on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates. We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for impairment is necessary. The initial qualitative approach assesses whether the existence of events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, the two step quantitative impairment test is performed. A step 1 analysis involves calculating the fair value of the associated reporting unit and comparing it to the reporting unit's carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill and the carrying value of the reporting unit is positive, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, step 2 of the impairment test must be performed. Step 2 involves calculating and comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value. Impairment is recognized if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its net book value. Such loss is calculated as the difference between the estimated implied fair value of goodwill and its carrying amount.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $191.9 million and $396.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The $204.7 million decrease was primarily attributable to a $280.7 million decrease in proceeds received from the issuance of securitization and other VIE long-term debt combined with a $10.0 million increase in purchases of treasury stock, partially offset by: (i) a $45.2 million increase in proceeds (net of repayments) from our revolving credit facilities, and (ii) a $38.1 million reduction in the repayment of securitization and other VIE long-term debt and derivatives.\nRevenues\nReconciliation of our Segments' Net Loss (Income) to Net (Loss) Income Attributable to The J.G. Wentworth Company\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test and modifies the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. An entity no longer will determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. An entity should apply the amendments in this update on a prospective basis. This ASU is effective for public business entities for their annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, for public business entities that are not SEC filers for their annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and for all other entities for their annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nProfessional and consulting costs increased to $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to $3.8 million in third-party fees incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of Home Lending and the reorganization of our structured settlement purchasing organization, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in legal expense.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments, which relates to how and when the acquiring entity recognizes adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period. This ASU eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for these adjustments to their respective provisional amount with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2015 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nGain on extinguishment of debt, net, was $0.6 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2015 gain resulted from the early repayment of the 2004-A securitization debt. The associated finance receivables were included in the 2015-1 securitization. In 2014, we repaid approximately $6.1 million of long-term debt issued by the 2002-A securitization and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of $0.3 million.\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE or whether we have acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. The reassessment also considers whether we have acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be significant to the VIE. As a result of this assessment, the consolidation status of the legal entities with which we are involved may change.\nOur Home Lending segment typically holds its mortgage loan inventory for 30 to 45 days with these warehouse facilities until the loans are sold to take-out investors or securitized directly with Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, at which time the amount outstanding with the warehouse facilities are repaid.\nRevenues\nThe securitization or sales of the purchased assets in Structured Settlements are normally structured with an \"initial close\" in which we issue the principal amount of securitized debt and receive: (i) cash in exchange for assets delivered and (ii) restricted cash in exchange for assets to be delivered 60 to 90 days in the future (referred to as the \"pre-funding\" date). On the pre-funding date, additional assets are delivered to the lenders in return for the lifting of restrictions on the restricted cash. As a result of structuring the securitizations in this fashion, our restricted cash balances have fluctuated significantly depending on the timing of the transactions' initial close and their associated pre-funding dates. We refer to each of these transactions as a monetization event. Historically, securitizations or direct asset sales have generally had two monetization events. For our 2015-3 securitization and our single 2015 direct asset sale, we opted not to have a pre-funding date, but instead had only a single monetization event: the initial close. In 2014, we completed five monetization events that were comprised of: (i) two securitizations which each had two monetization events during the calendar year and (ii) one securitization for which the initial close occurred in 2014 and the pre-funding occurred in 2015. In 2015, we completed seven monetization events which were comprised of: (i) the pre-funding from the securitization which completed the initial close in 2014, (ii) two direct assets sales which each had two monetization events in the calendar year, (iii) one direct asset sale which completed a single monetization event, and (iv) one securitization which also completed only a single monetization event. In 2016, we completed five monetization events which were comprised of: (i) two direct assets sales which each had two monetization events and (ii) one securitization for which the initial close was completed in 2016 and the pre-funding in 2017.\nNet cash provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the impact of $58.7 million increase in restricted cash that primarily related to the net effect of the following: (i) our 2015-3 securitization being structured with only an initial close and not having a pre-funding component and (ii) our 2016-1 securitization's initial close occurring in the fourth quarter of 2016 but the associated pre-funding occurring in the first quarter of 2017. As a result of the timing and the structure of the 2015-3 and 2016-1 securitizations, restricted cash increased by $58.8 million between December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016.\nIn conjunction with the implementation of the credit risk retention rules mandated by Dodd-Frank, we expect the total net cash proceeds to be received by the Company for each securitization in the Structured Settlement segment to be less than would have been received absent the application of such rules.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the liability method of accounting in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of the differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThese credit facilities are generally renewed annually for a period of 12 months and represent secured lending facilities with our originated mortgage loans serving as collateral. In addition, our lenders require pledge fund deposits of approximately one percent of the facility's capacity be maintained with the lender. Without these facilities we would not be able to meet our short-term liquidity requirements to operate our Home Lending segment.\nWe analyze our tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state and local tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, we determine that uncertainties\nCompensation and benefits expense decreased to $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to (i) a $3.5 million decrease in incentive compensation expense and (ii) a $1.1 million reduction in share-based compensation expense, which was partially offset by (a) a $1.0 million increase in severance expense related to the departure of several senior executives during the year ended 2015, including our former President and Chief Operating Officer, and (b) higher labor costs necessary to execute on our strategy of entering new lines of business and improving our information, data and analytic capabilities.\nOur Home Lending segment's results for the year ended December 31, 2016 are not directly comparable to the same period in the prior year since we acquired Home Lending on July 31, 2015. As a result, only five months of Home Lending's results of operations were included in the prior year's reporting period.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-entity transfers of Assets Other than Inventory. This ASU removes the current exception in U.S. GAAP prohibiting entities from recognizing current and deferred income tax expenses or benefits related to transfer of assets, other than inventory, within the consolidated entity. The current exception to defer the recognition of any tax impact on the transfer of inventory within the consolidated entity until it is sold to a third party remains unaffected. This ASU is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and for all other entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim reporting periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted and should be in the first interim period if an entity issues interim financial statements. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nSecuritization and Permanent Financing Debt, at Fair Value\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, at the commencement date of each lease. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. This ASU is effective for all entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments of this update should be applied using a modified retrospective approach, which requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nThe provision for losses represents estimates of losses to be incurred on the repurchase or indemnification of purchasers of mortgage loans. Certain sales contract and GSE standards require us to repurchase a loan or indemnify the purchaser or insurer for losses if a borrower fails to make initial loan payments or if the accompanying mortgage loan fails to meet certain customary representations and warranties, such as the nature and extent of underwriting standards. In the event of a breach of the representations and warranties, we may be required to either repurchase the loan or indemnify the purchaser for losses it sustains on the loan. We record a provision for estimated repurchases and loss indemnification on loans sold, which is charged to the provision for losses. In addition, the provision for losses also includes a reserve for potential losses related to impaired loans within our servicing portfolio, which include various factors such historical loss experience, actual write-offs during the period, known delinquent loans and GSE guidelines.\nDebt issuance costs decreased to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $5.1 million of debt issuance costs incurred in the year ended December 31, 2016 related to: (i) $0.5 million in fees to amend certain provisions of our previously issued securitization debt, (ii) $2.6 million in fees paid in connection with the issuance of $207.5 million of notes payable that are collateralized by the residual asset cash flows and reserve cash related to 36 of our securitizations, and (iii) $2.0 million in fees paid related to the 2016-1 securitization transaction that closed in October 2016. The $6.7 million of debt issuance costs incurred in the year ended December 31, 2015 related to fees incurred in connection with three securitization transactions that closed during 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued $117.3 million in securitized debt, a decrease of $358.6 million from the $475.9 million in securitized debt issued in 2015, due primarily to the Company electing to complete two direct asset sales in the first nine months of 2016 which do not result in the issuance of securitized debt. Underwriting fees associated with our securitizations are calculated as a percentage of the principal amount of debt issued.\nInterest income principally relates to our mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, which is recognized in income prior to the loan being sold, and is based on the principal amount outstanding and contractual interest rates.\nWe recorded a consolidated income tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2015 of $18.2 million compared to a provision for income taxes of $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our overall effective tax rate was 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to an overall effective rate of 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The reduction in the overall effective tax rate was due primarily to the impact of the permanent differences between book and taxable income (loss), including the $121.6 million impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets recorded in 2015.\n\nheld for sale), and (v) a $21.9 million increase in net proceeds from the sale of finance receivables.\nHome Lending's general and administrative expense primarily represents the cost to lease and operate the segment's headquarters in Woodbridge, Virginia and the various retail and direct lending call center offices across the country.\nNewly acquired finance receivable assets are accounted for at fair value until they are securitized or disposed of pursuant to a direct asset sale. Subsequent to acquisition but prior to securitization or sale, the Company generally borrows against purchased finance receivables pursuant to one of its revolving credit facilities. When the Company borrows against its finance receivables, it transfers the encumbered assets into a VIE. If the finance receivables are securitized, immediately prior to securitization, the securitized assets are adjusted to their current fair value and the resulting change in fair value is included in gains/(losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one. If the finance receivables are included in a direct asset sale, the previously recognized unrealized gains/(losses) are reversed and the difference between the purchase price and sales price is recorded as a realized gain and included in gains/(losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one. The difference between the price paid to acquire finance receivables and their fair value at the end of the month acquired is referred to as \"day one gains\". Changes in fair value of finance receivables acquired in prior months are referred to as \"gains (losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one\".\nNet cash used in investing activities was $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $56.3 million change was primarily due to: (i) $47.4 million of net cash used to acquire our Home Lending segment in 2015 and (ii) the collection of a $6.1 million note receivable in 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $80.2 million. Our primary source of funds for the Structured Settlements and Home Lending segments include secured borrowings in the form of warehouse lines of credit and revolving credit facilities with financial institutions. These credit facilities are generally renewed for a period of 12 to 18 months. In the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our financing needs and adjust our aggregate borrowing capacity in light of current and projected business needs and market conditions. Although we have historically been able to renew or replace these facilities in advance of their maturity to ensure our ongoing liquidity and access to capital, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. Further, it is likely that GNMA will place restrictions on the cash generated by Home Lending such that it can only be used for Home Lending's operations and cannot be used for corporate-level purposes. Due to the risk retention rules from Dodd-Frank, in the future we will need to retain an additional portion of the credit risk of the assets which will result in less cash available at each securitization. Despite this restriction, we believe our cash on hand and cash generated from the purchase and subsequent securitization or direct asset sale of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams will allow us to meet our current and future liquidity needs over the next 12 months. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to securitize or sell our payment streams or mortgage loans at favorable rates. We may also consider selling our pre-settlement assets or financing these or other uncollateralized assets.\nOn September 2, 2016, the Company repaid the $131.4 million outstanding balance on the Residual Term Facility through the issuance of $207.5 million of notes payable collateralized by the residual asset cash flows and reserve cash related to 36 of our securitizations. The Company incurred $0.4 million in debt termination costs and expensed $3.3 million of unamortized debt issuance costs during the three months ended September 30, 2016 in connection with the termination of this facility, which were included in interest expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\nWe elected fair value treatment under Accounting Standards Codification 810, Financial Instruments (\"ASC 810\"), to measure the VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts and related VIE finance receivables. We have determined that measurement of the VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts at fair value better correlates with the fair value of the VIE finance receivables held by special purpose entities (\"SPEs\"), which are held to provide the cash flow for the note obligations. The debt issued by our VIE securitization and permanent financing trusts is recourse only to the respective entities that issued the debt and is non-recourse to the Company and its other subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries continue to receive fees for servicing the securitized assets which are eliminated in consolidation. In addition, the risk to our non-SPE subsidiaries from SPE losses is limited to cash reserves, residual interest amounts and repurchases of structured settlement payment streams that are subsequently determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the securitization or permanent financing trusts.", "item_7_text": "In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-03, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (Topic 250) and Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the September 22, 2016 and November 17, 2016 EITF Meetings. This ASU is intended to provide clarity in relation to the disclosure of the impact that ASU Nos. 2014-09, 2016-02 and 2016-13 will have on our financial statements when adopted. The effective date for this guidance is the same as the effective dates for ASU Nos. 2014-09, 2016-02 and 2016-13. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $8.7 million and $50.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $41.8 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to (i) the Company making the final $7.6 million purchase price payment to the former owners of the Home Lending segment during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the $47.4 million of net cash used to acquire Home Lending during the year ended December 31, 2015 and (ii) a $2.0 million decrease in purchases of premises and equipment, net of sales proceeds.\nThe counterparties to the structured settlement and annuity payment streams we purchase have mostly investment grade credit ratings. Approximately 75.5% of the counterparties to structured settlement payment streams that we purchased in 2016 were rated \"A3\" or better by Moody's. This reduced credit risk, together with the long weighted average life and low pre-payment risk, results in a desirable asset class that can be securitized and sold in the asset-backed security market or through outright-sale transactions.\nRealized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt, and derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was comprised of the following:\nFinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of databases, customer relationships, trade names and affinity relationships. Our databases are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. Customer relationships are amortized over their useful lives of 3 years to 15 years. Amortizable trade names are amortized over their useful life of 3 years. Affinity relationships are amortized over their useful life of 10 years.\nOur most significant need for liquidity beyond the next 12 months is the repayment of the principal and interest amounts of our outstanding senior secured term loan. We anticipate utilizing cash on hand, cash flow generated through our securitization and direct-asset sale program and bank borrowings for our long-term liquidity needs. If available, we may also utilize debt refinancings and new debt and equity offerings for our long-term liquidity needs. We have engaged a consultant to assist us in evaluating our capital structure and refinancing our outstanding indebtedness. However, there can be no assurances that we will have sufficient cash reserves, or that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or that future borrowings or refinancings will be available in an amount sufficient to be able to fund our liquidity needs on a long-term basis.\n\nU.S. GAAP requires that MSRs initially be recorded at fair value at the time the underlying mortgage loans are sold with servicing rights retained. MSRs are subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting period. The increase (decrease) in the fair value of our MSRs portfolio resulting from: (i) loans sold with servicing rights retained; (ii) the runoff of our MSRs portfolio including payoffs; and (iii) changes in fair valuation inputs and assumptions is included in changes in MSRs, net, in our consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the value of our MSRs increased by $12.4 million due to the $1.1 billion net increase in the unpaid principal balance of our MSRs portfolio, coupled with a $2.8 million increase in the fair value of MSRs resulting from the increase in mortgage interest rates during the year. From the date of acquisition through December 31, 2015, the fair value of our MSRs increased by $1.6 million primarily due to the $212.4 million net increase in the unpaid principal balance of our MSRs portfolio.\nWe previously financed our pre-settlement funding transactions through a revolving credit facility. The $35.0 million facility was structured with a revolving period that ended on December 31, 2015. The principal amount outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2015 was converted into a \"term advance\" facility requiring minimum principal payments over the subsequent 24 month amortization period with interest payable monthly and calculated in the same manner as the original credit facility. In August 2016, the Company made principal payments to fully repay this term advance facility and then terminated the facility. The Company incurred less than $0.1 million in fees related to the termination.\nResidual Financing\n\n\nPre-Settlement Funding\nTotal realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $60.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of the following: (i) approximately $45.2 million was due to a change in the discount rate applied to TRB purchases, or purchase yield, as compared to the prior year coupled with an unfavorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value these assets during the respective periods, and (ii) approximately $15.2 million was due to a $73.8 million decrease, or 7.0%, in guaranteed structured settlements, annuities and lotteries and life contingent structured settlements and annuities TRB purchases, from $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $976.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which relates to how an entity recognizes the revenue it expects to be entitled to for the transfer of promised goods and services to customers. In the first six months of 2016, the FASB issued amendments to this standard (ASU Nos. 2016-8, 2016-10, 2016-11, 2016-12 and 2016-20), which provide further clarification regarding this standard. ASU 2014-09 will replace certain existing revenue recognition guidance when it becomes effective. The original effective date of the guidance was deferred in August 2015 by the issuance of ASU No. 2015-14 and is effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period and for all other entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Management has commenced its implementation activities and determined that the following revenue streams are not impacted by or are excluded from the scope of this ASU: a) interest income, b) realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives, c) realized and unrealized gains on sale of mortgage loans held for sale, net of direct costs d) changes in mortgage servicing rights, net, e) loan servicing fees, and f) realized and unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities, net. Management is continuing to evaluate the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was comprised of the following:\nOur warehouse facilities are structured with advance rates that range from 92.5% to 95.5% and discount rates that range from 8.0% to 9.2%. The discount rate is either fixed over the term of the facility or is based on a fixed spread over a floating swap rate, which we then fix through interest rate swaps at the time of the borrowing. The discount rate is used to discount the payment streams we have purchased, and these discounted payment streams are then multiplied by the advance rate to determine the amount of funds that are available to us under the warehouse facilities.\nAdvertising expense consists of our marketing costs including television, internet, direct mail and other related expenses. Advertising expense for the five months ended December 31, 2015 included $0.7 million in costs associated with the re-branding of WestStar Mortgage Inc. as J.G. Wentworth Home Lending, Inc. (and ultimately J. G. Wentworth Home Lending, LLC) and the production costs for new television commercials that began to air in the third quarter of 2015.\nWe are focused on providing direct-to-consumer access to financing solutions through a variety of avenues, including: mortgage lending, structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment purchasing, prepaid cards, and access to providers of personal loans. Our direct-to-consumer businesses use digital channels, television, direct mail, and other channels to offer access to financing solutions. We warehouse, securitize, sell or otherwise finance the financial assets that we purchase in transactions that are structured to ultimately generate cash proceeds to us that exceed the purchase price we paid for those assets.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The J.G. Wentworth Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest, and those variable interest entities where our wholly-owned subsidiaries are the primary beneficiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 included the impact of $66.2 million decrease in restricted cash during the year that primarily related to the net effect of: (a) the timing of our 2014-3 securitization's pre-funding discussed previously and (b) our 2015-3 securitization being structured with only an initial close and not having an associated pre-funding component. The impact of the timing and structure of the 2014-3 and 2015-3 securitizations was a $71.8 million of a decrease to our restricted cash balance between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015.\nThe net loss attributable to non-controlling interests represents the portion of loss attributable to the economic interests in JGW LLC held by the non-controlling Common Interestholders. The $51.2 million net loss attributable to the non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2016 represents the non-controlling interests' 45.5% weighted average economic interest in JGW LLC's net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $101.8 million net loss attributable to the non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2015 represents the non-controlling interests' 48.3% weighted average economic interest in JGW LLC's net income for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe, through our subsidiaries, sell finance receivables to SPEs. An SPE issues notes secured by undivided interests in the receivables. Payments due on these notes generally correspond to receipts from the receivables in terms of the timing of payments due. We retain an interest in the SPEs and are deemed to have control over these SPEs due to our servicing or subservicing role and therefore consolidate these SPEs.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity's accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. This ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017 and for all other entities beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\naggregate borrowing capacity were reduced to $295.0 million. In July 2016, we modified the terms of our $50.0 million warehouse facility and extended its maturity through January 2017. Under the terms of the revised facility agreement, the committed amount decreases by $5.0 million each month through maturity, starting in August 2016. In January 2017, we extended the renewal date of this facility from January 6, 2017 to February 5, 2017, at which time the line expired and was not renewed. In October 2016, we increased the capacity of our $50.0 million warehouse line of credit to $70.0 million and in January 2017, the capacity reverted to $50.0 million. In January 2017, we increased the capacity of our $75.0 million warehouse line of credit to $100.0 million and we extended the renewal date of our $95.0 million warehouse line of credit from February 10, 2017 to February 9, 2018. In March 2017, we canceled the $100.0 million warehouse line of credit that was scheduled to mature in September 2017. Also, in March 2017, we received a commitment of $50.0 million from a new lender for a warehouse line of credit on competitive terms. As of March 29, 2017, our borrowing facilities have an aggregate borrowing capacity of $295.0 million. We regularly assess our warehouse facilities and adjust the amount and the terms of our committed warehouse lines in light of market conditions.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Credit Facility requires us, to the extent that as of the last day of any fiscal quarter there are outstanding balances on the revolving commitment that exceed specific thresholds (generally 15% of the $20.0 million borrowing capacity, or $3.0 million), to comply with a maximum total leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving commitment, and, as a result, the maximum total leverage ratio requirement was not applicable. Had the leverage ratio requirement been applicable as of December 31, 2016, we would not have satisfied the maximum total leverage ratio requirement and would have been required to repay the outstanding borrowings on the revolver in excess of the specified threshold.\nExpenses\nServicing, broker and other fees represent revenue recognized for servicing mortgage loans for various investors that are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance. The primary driver of our servicing revenue is our MSRs portfolio. The outstanding unpaid principal balance of serviced mortgages was $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.1 billion from the prior year unpaid principal balance of serviced mortgages of $3.0 billion.\nHome Lending\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when the following conditions have been satisfied: (1) the transferred assets have been isolated from the Company, beyond the reach of the Company and its creditors; (2) the transferee obtains the right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets; and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity, or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets or through an agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them. Transfers that do not meet the criteria to be accounted for as sales are accounted for as secured borrowings.\nJGW LLC and the majority of its subsidiaries operate in the U.S. as non-tax paying entities, and are treated as disregarded entities for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes and generally as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, certain of JGW LLC's wholly-owned subsidiaries are operating as corporations within the U.S. and subject to U.S. federal and state tax. As non-tax paying entities, the majority of JGW LLC's net income or loss is attributable to its members and included in their tax returns. The current and deferred income tax provision (benefit) relates to both the income (loss) attributable to the Corporation from JGW LLC and to the tax-paying subsidiaries of JGW LLC.\nRealized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt, and derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was comprised of the following:\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06, Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments, which addresses diversity in practice in assessing embedded contingent call or put options in debt instruments. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. This ASU should be applied using a modified retrospective approach to existing debt instruments as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which this ASU is effective. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nWe finance our mortgage loan origination activities primarily through five separate warehouse facilities that had an aggregate capacity of $365.0 million as of December 31, 2016. Subsequent to year-end, our borrowing facilities and the current\nOperating Line of Credit\nCompensation and benefits includes salaries for Home Lending employees, commissions paid to loan officers, applicable taxes and the cost of providing employee benefits. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Home Lending recorded severance charges of $0.5 million related primarily to the departure of two former owners of the acquired entity.\nInterest expense represents interest on Home Lending's: (i) five warehouse credit facilities with various financial institutions used to originate mortgage loans held for sale that had a combined maximum borrowing capacity of $365.0 million as of December 31, 2016; and (ii) a single operating line of credit, which is collateralized by our MSRs, with a maximum borrowing capacity of $10.0 million as of December 31, 2016.\nIn evaluating performance, we net the gains on mortgage loans sold, unrealized gains on mortgage loans held for sale, interest rate lock commitments (\"IRLCs\"), and associated derivative instruments (i.e., forward sale commitments to deliver mortgage loans and forward sales of MBS) resulting from fair value mark-to-market adjustments, with direct costs such as fees paid to third parties to originate and sell the associated mortgage loans, and present it as realized and unrealized gains on sale of\nConsolidation\nOn September 2, 2016, the Company issued $207.5 million in notes collateralized by the residual asset cash flows and reserve cash interests related to 36 VIE securitization entities, which generated $65.9 million in net cash proceeds. The Company incurred $2.6 million of debt issuance costs which were included in debt issuance expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The Company acts as the servicer and/or the subservicer and principal and interest are paid monthly from the cash flows from these collateralized residual interests.\nThe $4.9 million increase in accretion income on finance receivables was primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding securitized finance receivables balance partially offset by a decrease in the average fair value discount rates used to calculate interest income on the associated securitized assets during the periods. The $1.3 million decrease in interest income on pre-settlement funding transaction receivables was due to a reduction in the associated VIE and other finance receivables resulting from management's decision to curtail purchases of such assets in April 2015.\nHome Lending Segment\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\n\nAs a consequence of the initial sales and any future exchanges of Common Interests for shares of our Class A common stock or Class C common stock, we may increase our share of the tax basis of the assets then owned by JGW LLC. Any such increase in tax basis is anticipated to allow us the ability to reduce the amount of future tax payments to the extent that we have future taxable income. We are obligated, pursuant to our tax receivable agreement with all Common Interestholders who held in excess of approximately 1% of the Common Interests as of immediately prior to our IPO, to pay to such Common Interestholders 85% of the amount of income tax we save for each tax period as a result of the tax benefits generated from the initial sales and any subsequent exchange of Common Interests for our Class A common stock or Class C common stock and from the use of certain tax attributes. We expect to fund these long-term requirements under the tax receivable agreement with tax distributions received from JGW LLC and, if necessary, loans from JGW LLC.\n (b) Certain of our contractual obligations and commitments are funded through cash flows from certain VIE finance receivables included on our consolidated balance sheets. \nExpenses\nWe recorded a consolidated income tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2016 of $15.3 million compared to a benefit of $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our overall effective tax rate was 13.5% for the year ended\nWe qualify as an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and do, rely on exemptions from certain financial disclosure requirements under U.S. GAAP that are not applicable to other companies that are not emerging growth companies. In particular, we can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards which allows us to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We took advantage of the extended transition period as permitted under JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nComparison of Structured Settlements Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nWe have (i) a widely syndicated senior secured term loan with a principal balance of $449.5 million as of December 31, 2016 which matures in February 2019, and (ii) a $20.0 million revolving commitment that matures in August 2017. At each interest reset date, we have the option to elect that the senior secured term loan be either a Eurodollar loan or a Base Rate loan. If a Eurodollar loan, interest accrues at either Libor or 1.0% (whichever is greater) plus a spread of 6.0%. If a Base Rate loan, interest accrues at prime or 2.0% (whichever is greater) plus a spread of 5.0%. The revolving commitment has the same interest rate terms as the senior secured term loan. There are no principal payments due on the senior secured term loan until its maturity in February 2019.\nAdvertising expense, which consists of our marketing costs including television, internet, direct mail and other related expenses, decreased to $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a $13.2 million decrease in our television spend that was partially offset by a $4.7 million net increase in our internet, direct mailing, and other advertising expenses. We continually assess the effectiveness of our advertising initiatives and adjust the timing, investment and advertising channels on an ongoing basis.\nDecember 31, 2014. The $6.3 million increase was primarily attributable to: (i) a $4.2 million increase in interest expense associated with our VIE securitized debt that resulted from an increase in the average outstanding balance between periods, partially offset by a decrease in the interest rate used to calculate interest expense and (ii) a $1.9 million increase in interest expense associated with our VIE long term debt that was principally due an increase in the average outstanding balance of our residual term debt and an increase and in the corresponding interest rate. In August 2015, we amended our residual term loan to increase the principal amount outstanding by $25.0 million to $133.0 million. In connection with the amendment, the interest rate increased from 7.00% to 7.25%.\nWe have intangible assets which have indefinite and finite lives, which are accounted for under ASC 350. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's carrying value may not be fully recoverable, and are tested at least annually. An impairment loss, calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset, is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset is less than the corresponding carrying value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of licenses and approvals.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nAdvertising expense, which consists of our marketing costs including television, internet, direct mail and other related expenses, decreased to $44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to a $10.0 million decrease in our television spend and a $5.1 million decrease in our internet, direct mailing, and other advertising expenses. These actions were part of our previously announced plan to turn around the Structured Settlements segment in part by overhauling our media spend. We continually assess the effectiveness of our advertising initiatives and adjust the timing, investment and advertising channels on an ongoing basis.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent in the classified statement of financial position. This ASU becomes effective for public entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and for all other entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nThe $0.1 million loss on interest rate swaps related to warehouse facilities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of the termination of interest rate swaps with a notional value of $61.1 million that were executed as part of our strategy to hedge interest rate risk. The $0.6 million loss on interest rate swaps related to warehouse facilities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was the result of the termination of interest rate swaps with a notional value of $46.5 million that were executed as part of our strategy to hedge interest rate risk.\nThe Company had a Residual Term Facility that was secured by the cash flows from our residual interests in 28 securitizations and was structured with a $133.0 million A1 Note that was due in May 2021. The interest rate on the Residual Term Facility was 7.25%. The Residual Term Facility did not require minimum annual principal payments.\nLoan origination fee income earned during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $9.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively, which represents revenue earned from originating mortgage loans and generally represents flat, per loan fee amounts.\nStructured Settlements Segment\nComparison of Structured Settlements Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\n(1) Includes activity since the acquisition of Home Lending on July 31, 2015.\n (d) Long-term debt does not include $5.4 million of debt associated with our Long-Term Pre-Settlement Facility which has no stated maturity date. \nfacilities or obtain new financing facilities.\nOther Financing\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nLotteries\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, based on review of our projections for our Structures Settlements segment based on lower than anticipated results, a significant decline in the stock price of our Class A common stock, and a re-assessment of the reporting unit's brand strategy, we recorded impairment charges of $121.6 million comprised of the following: (i) an $85.0 million write-down of goodwill, (ii) a $35.5 million write-down of the indefinite-lived trade name, and (iii) a $1.1 million write-down of other intangible assets.\nLife Contingent Structured Settlements and Life Contingent Annuities\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $215.4 million, a decrease of $54.2 million, or 20.1%, from $269.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $62.8 million unfavorable change in realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives, partially offset by an $8.7 million increase in realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities, net.\n\nWe maintain a $10.0 million line of credit with a financial institution that is generally renewed annually for a period of 12 months and represents a secured lending facility with our MSRs serving as collateral. In August 2016, we increased the capacity of this line of credit to $10.0 million from $6.0 million and extended the maturity date through June 16, 2017. The Company may only draw on $4.0 million of the capacity until we receive regulatory approval.\n \u2022 Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date. \nThese warehouse facilities are used strictly to fund the guaranteed structured settlement and annuity payment stream purchases. Our ability to fund current operations depends upon our ability to secure these types of short-term financings on acceptable terms and to renew or replace the financings as they expire. While we historically have been able to regularly renew the warehouse facilities in the ordinary course of business, we cannot assure that we will be able to renew, replace or refinance our existing financing arrangements or enter into additional financing arrangements on terms that are commercially reasonable or at all. In addition, a negative ratings action by a rating agency, an adverse action by a regulatory authority or a general deterioration in the economy that constricts the availability of credit may increase our cost of funds and may impair our ability to renew existing\nTotal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $357.7 million, a decrease of $129.3 million, or 26.5%, from expenses of $487.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nTotal realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables represent: (i) unrealized gains and losses on finance receivables acquired from customers prior to their securitization and (ii) realized gains and losses on finance receivables acquired from customers resulting from their inclusion in direct asset sale transactions.\nThese warehouse facilities are used strictly to fund the origination of mortgage loans. Our ability to fund current operations depends upon our ability to secure these types of short-term financings on acceptable terms and to renew or replace the financings as they expire. These warehouse facilities are uncommitted and, at any given time, we may not be able to obtain additional financing under them when we need it, exposing us to, among other things, liquidity risks of the types described in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. While we historically have been able to regularly renew the warehouse facilities in the ordinary course of business, we cannot assure that we will be able to renew, replace or refinance our existing financing arrangements or enter into additional financing arrangements on terms that are commercially reasonable or at all. In addition, a negative ratings action by a rating agency, an adverse action by a regulatory authority or a general deterioration in the economy that constricts the availability of credit may increase our cost of funds and may impair our ability to renew existing facilities or obtain new financing facilities.\nStructured Settlements and Annuities\n (c) On September 2, 2016, we permanently financed the residual asset cash flows and reserve cash associated with 36 of the Company's securitizations with outstanding principle balances. The debt is now classified as Long-term debt issued by securitizations and permanent financing trusts, whereas in the prior year, the debt was classified as Long-term debt. \nIn 2013, we began purchasing lottery payment streams and have structured one of our two remaining guaranteed structured settlement and annuity warehouse facilities to allow us to finance lottery payment streams. This allows us to aggregate a pool of such payment streams that we subsequently include with structured settlement and annuity payment streams in securitizations and direct asset sales. We intend to continue to include lottery payment streams in securitizations and direct asset sales in the future.\nResults of Operations\nTax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and evaluating tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties under U.S. GAAP. Management reviews its tax positions periodically and adjusts its tax balances as new information becomes available.\nThe $102.0 million decrease in our loss before income taxes was principally due to a $75.0 million decrease in our pre-tax loss from our Structured Settlements segment that was the result of: (i) $121.6 million in impairment charges recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $5.5 million in impairment charges recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 and (ii) a $15.1 million decrease in advertising expense as part of our previously announced cost-saving initiatives, partially offset by a $62.8 million unfavorable change in realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long term debt and derivatives driven by lower TRB purchases and a decrease in realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables. The decrease in Structured Settlements' pre-tax loss was coupled with an increase of $27.0 million in pre-tax income generated by our Home Lending segment that was driven by growth in interest rate lock volume of approximately $4.0 billion due in part to the low interest rate environment and as a result of only five months of Home Lending's results of operations being included in the Company's consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe $3.1 million loss on termination of interest rate swaps related to securitized debt during the year ended December 31, 2016 represents the loss on the termination of interest rate swaps related to the Peachtree Structured Settlements, LLC (\"PSS\") securitized debt that had a notional value of $13.8 million. There was no loss on the termination of interest rate swaps related to securitized debt during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe maintain other permanent financing arrangements that have been used in the past for longer term funding purposes. Each of these arrangements has assets pledged as collateral, the cash flows from which are used to satisfy the loan obligations. These other financing arrangements are more fully described in Notes 18 and 19 in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under \"Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data'\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nCompensation and benefits expense decreased to $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an $8.1 million decrease in salaries, commissions and payroll taxes that resulted from a combination of lower headcount and lower commissions due to lower TRB purchase volume in the current year compared to the prior year.\nThe debt issued by our securitization VIEs is reported on our consolidated balance sheets as VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts, at fair value (\"VIE securitization debt\"). The VIE securitization debt is recourse solely to the VIE finance receivables held by such SPEs and is non-recourse to us and our other consolidated subsidiaries. The VIEs will continue in operation until all securitization debt is paid and all residual cash flows are collected. As a result of the long lives of many finance receivables purchased and securitized by us, most consolidated VIEs have expected lives in excess of 20 years.\nWe regularly assess our warehouse facilities and adjust the nature and amount of our committed warehouse lines in light of market conditions. Based on current and projected financing needs, we terminated a $50.0 million and a $300.0 million warehouse facility in January 2016 and May 2016, respectively. Subsequent to these terminations, our total borrowing capacity under our warehouse facilities is $400.0 million. We intend to renew or replace the two remaining guaranteed structured settlement and annuity warehouse facilities prior to the end of their respective revolving periods to better reflect our financing needs in the future.\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nWe utilize a number of different funding sources to finance our segments and their associated business activities.\n\nProfessional and consulting costs decreased to $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $7.9 million decrease was primarily due to third-party fees incurred in connection with the 2015 acquisition of Home Lending and an overall decrease in the use of outside consultants as part of our cost-savings initiatives.\nThe $1.5 million loss on interest rate swaps related to warehouse facilities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was the result of the termination of interest rate swaps with a notional value of $75.2 million that were executed as part of our strategy to hedge interest rate risk. The $0.1 million loss on interest rate swaps related to warehouse facilities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of the termination of interest rate swaps with a notional value of $61.1 million that were executed as part of our strategy to hedge interest rate risk.\nThe amendments to ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing (\"ASC 860\"), eliminated the concept of a qualified special purpose entity, changed the requirements for derecognizing financial assets, and required additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions and continuing involvement with transferred financial assets.\n(1) Home Lending was acquired on July 31, 2015, and, therefore, the results for the year ended December 31, 2015 include only two months of Home Lending's operations.\nInterest income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was comprised of the following:\nThe $4.6 million increase in accretion income on finance receivables was primarily due to an increase in the average fair value discount rate used to calculate interest income on the associated securitized assets, partially offset by a decrease in our average outstanding securitized finance receivables balance during the periods. The $4.0 million decrease in interest income on pre-settlement funding transaction receivables was due to a reduction in the associated VIE and other finance receivables resulting from management's decision to curtail purchases of such assets in April 2015.\nWe intend, subject to market conditions, management discretion and other relevant factors, to undertake multiple securitizations or direct asset sales in the future. Although diversifying our financing strategy allows us to realize greater cost efficiencies in our capital market transactions and provides us with increased flexibility, we still believe the asset-backed securities market has been and continues to be the Company's principal market.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nIn establishing accounting policies within the framework of U.S. GAAP, management must make certain assessments, estimates, and choices that will result in the application of these principals in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies and estimates that we consider to be critical.\nWe finance our guaranteed structured settlement and annuity payment stream purchases with available cash and cash equivalents and/or through two separate warehouse facilities. As of December 31, 2016, these two warehouse facilities had $400.0 million of aggregate capacity which consisted of: (i) a $300.0 million syndicated warehouse facility with a revolving period that ends in July 2017 and (ii) a $100.0 million warehouse facility with a revolving period that ends in May 2018. Subsequent to the expiration or termination of their respective revolving lines of credit, our warehouse facilities have amortization periods of four months ($300.0 million facility) or 18 months ($100.0 million facility) before final maturity, allowing us time to exit or refinance the warehouse facility after the revolving period has ended. As of December 31, 2016, we had $343.6 million in total unused borrowing capacity across the two separate warehouse facilities used to finance our guaranteed structured settlement and annuity payment stream purchases.\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved with various entities that are considered to be VIEs. A VIE is an entity that has either a total investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest under the voting interest model of consolidation. We are required to consolidate any VIE if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has the power to direct those activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses from or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We review all significant interests in the VIEs we are involved with including consideration of the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance and whether we have control over those activities. As a result of adopting ASC 810, we determined we were the primary beneficiary of the VIEs used to securitize our finance receivables (\"VIE finance receivables\"). We elected the fair value option with respect to assets and liabilities in our securitization VIEs as part of their initial consolidation on January 1, 2010.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). This ASU was issued to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nComparison of Home Lending Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\n2016 Highlights\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 included the impact of a $66.2 million decrease in restricted cash during the year that primarily related to the net effect of: (i) the timing of 2014-3 securitization's initial close occurring in the fourth quarter of 2014 but the associated pre-funding occurring in the first quarter of 2015 and (ii) our 2015-3 securitization being structured with only an initial close and not having an associated pre-funding. The impact of the timing and structure of the 2014-3 and 2015-3 securitizations was a $71.8 million decrease in our restricted cash balance between December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-04, Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products, which addresses the current and potential future diversity in practice related to the de-recognition of a prepaid stored-value product liability. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we re-evaluated our projections for our Structured Settlements segment based on lower than anticipated results, a significant decline in the stock price of our Class A common stock, and a re-assessment of the reporting unit's brand strategy. Accordingly, we determined these events constituted a triggering event requiring us to test the goodwill and finite and indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the 2011 acquisition of OAC for potential impairment. As a result of this analysis, we determined in the third quarter that the trade name within the reporting unit was impaired and recorded a $29.9 million impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRealized and unrealized (losses) gains on marketable securities, net, was a $4.6 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, an unfavorable change from the $0.9 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to lower investment returns on marketable securities. The decrease was primarily offset by a corresponding decrease in installment obligations (income) expense, net. These amounts relate to the marketable securities and installment obligations payable on our consolidated balance sheets. The marketable securities are owned by us but are held to fully offset our installment obligations liability. Therefore, increases or decreases in gains on marketable securities do not impact our net income.\n\nThe change in our net (loss) income before income taxes was principally due to a $335.1 million decline in pre-tax income from our Structured Settlements segment that was the result of: (i) a $221.1 million decrease in realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long term debt and derivatives driven by: (a) an unfavorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows, (b) lower TRB purchases, and (c) a decrease in the current year's discount rate applied to TRB purchases, and (ii) the current year's impairment charges totaling $121.6 million to reduce the segment's goodwill and intangible assets to their respective fair values. Our Home Lending segment, which we acquired on July 31, 2015, generated pre-tax income of $2.0 million in 2015.\nWe currently operate our business through two business segments: (i) Structured Settlements and (ii) Home Lending. Our Structured Settlements segment provides liquidity to customers by purchasing structured settlements, annuities and lottery winnings. Structured Settlements also includes corporate activities, payment solutions, pre-settlements and providing (i) access to providers of personal lending and (ii) access to providers of funding for pre-settled legal claims. Our Home Lending segment specializes in originating, selling and servicing residential mortgage loans.\nWe decided, beginning in April 2015, to curtail our purchases of pre-settlement transactions. We have, however, and will continue to broker leads for such transactions to third parties in exchange for broker or referral fees, and, in the normal course of our business, will evaluate our existing pool of pre-settlement assets for retention or sale. Ceasing purchases of pre-settlement transactions has not had a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.\n(1) Includes activity since the acquisition of Home Lending on July 31, 2015.\nmortgage loans held for sale, net of direct costs, in our consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated $82.2 million in gross revenue from the sale of mortgage loans and netted against it $7.1 million in direct costs, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, when we generated $20.5 million in gross revenue from the sale of mortgage loans and netted against it $1.9 million in direct costs.\n \u2022 Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable, reflecting the entity's own assumptions about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the assets or owes the liabilities rather than an entity specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities at the measurement date. We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We also evaluate various factors to determine whether certain transactions are orderly and may make adjustments to transactions or quoted prices when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have decreased significantly.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe $0.6 million gain on extinguishment of securitized debt during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from the early repayment of the 2004-A securitization debt issued by Structured Receivables Finance #1, LLC. The associated finance receivables subsequently were included in the 2015-1 securitization. There was no gain on extinguishment of securitized debt during the year ended December 31, 2016.\n \u2022 Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices in markets that are not active or quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. \nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This ASU was issued to provide more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and changes the loss impairment methodology. This ASU is effective for all entities for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 using a modified retrospective adoption method. A prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nComparison of Consolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nOverview\nIncome Taxes\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which requires an entity to re-evaluate its consolidation for limited partnerships or similar entities. This ASU requires an entity to apply this amendment using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period of adoption. This ASU changes the criteria that an entity uses to identify a variable interest entity, how it characterizes the VIE for a limited partnership or similar entity and how it determines the primary beneficiary. For public entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and for nonpublic entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control, which further clarified ASU No. 2015-02. This update amends the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a VIE should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. Entities that have not yet adopted the amendments in ASU No. 2015-02 are required to adopt the amendments in ASU 2016-17 at the same time they adopt the amendments in ASU No. 2015-02 and should apply the same transition method elected for the application of ASU No. 2015-02. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and whether we will apply either the retrospective or modified-retrospective approach upon adoption.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $125.7 million and $399.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The cash used in operating activities does not reflect the financing of our purchased receivables which is an integral part of our Structured Settlements segment and is reflected in net cash provided by financing activities. The $274.1 million decrease in the net cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to: (i) a $155.1 million decrease related to changes in restricted cash and investments primarily due to the timing and structure of securitizations in the fourth quarters of 2015, 2014 and 2013, (ii) a $54.1 million decrease in purchases of finance receivables, (iii) a $27.0 increase in collections on finance receivables, (iv) a $24.6 million decrease resulting from the Home Lending segment's proceeds from the sale and principal payments on mortgage loans held for sale (net of originations and purchases of mortgages\nThe decrease in debt issuance costs from the prior year was due to a $1.9 million reduction in underwriting fees resulting from the lower volume of securitized debt issued in the current year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued approximately $475.9 million in securitized debt, a decrease of $193.1 million from the approximately $669.0 million in securitized debt issued in 2014. Underwriting fees associated with our securitizations are calculated as a percentage of the principal amount of debt issued.\nCredit Facility\nin tax positions exist, a reserve will be established. We will recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our consolidated statements of operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the \"Risk Factors\" and the \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nNewly acquired finance receivable assets are accounted for at fair value until they are securitized or disposed of pursuant to a direct asset sale. Subsequent to acquisition but prior to securitization or sale, the Company generally borrows against purchased finance receivables pursuant to one of its revolving credit facilities. When the Company borrows against its finance receivables, it transfers the encumbered assets into a VIE. If the finance receivables are securitized, immediately prior to securitization, the securitized assets are adjusted to their current fair value and the resulting change in fair value is included in gains/(losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one. If the finance receivables are included in a direct asset sale, the previously recognized unrealized gains/(losses) are reversed and the difference between the purchase price and sales price is recorded as a realized gain and included in gains/(losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one. The difference between the price paid to acquire finance receivables and their fair value at the end of the month acquired is referred to as \"day one gains\". Changes in fair value of finance receivables acquired in prior months are referred to as \"gains (losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one\".\nMortgage Loans Held For Sale\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nComparison of Consolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test. The results of the analysis indicated an additional impairment of the trade name as well as an impairment of the goodwill within the reporting unit. Consequently, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $91.7 million in the fourth quarter comprised of the following: (i) an $85.0 million write-down of goodwill, (ii) an additional $5.6 million write-down of the indefinite-lived trade name, and (iii) a $1.1 million write-down of other intangible assets. While we believe our assumptions used in the determination of the asset's fair value are reasonable, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Less than anticipated revenues generated by the remaining intangible assets, an increase in discount rates, and/or a decrease in our projected growth rates used in the discounted cash flow model could result in future impairment charges.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of the two reportable Segments' Net Loss to Net Loss Attributable to The J.G. Wentworth Company for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nWe finance our purchases of life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams through a committed permanent financing facility with a capacity of $100.0 million that can be increased at the lender's by $50.0 million. This facility allows us to purchase life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams without assuming any mortality risk. This facility is structured as a permanent facility, whereby the life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams we purchase are financed for their entire life and remain within the facility until maturity. The payment streams purchased are funded at a fixed advance rate of 94%, while the discount rate used to value the payment streams is variable, depending on the characteristics of the payment streams. The life contingent structured settlement and life contingent annuity payment streams that we purchase are discounted at a higher rate than the discount rates applied to those payment streams under the committed permanent financing facility, with the result that the funds available to be drawn under the facility exceed the purchase price for the payment streams we purchase. This positive cash flow is used to support our business and cover a portion of our operating expenses. As of December 31, 2016, our permanent financing facility had $17.0 million of unused capacity for our life contingent annuity and structured settlement businesses.\nFunding Sources\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $42.5 million and $(125.7) million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash provided by (used in) operating activities does not reflect the financing of our purchased receivables, which is an integral part of our Structured Settlements segment and is reflected in net cash (used in) provided by financing activities. In 2016, based on market conditions, we completed one securitization and two direct asset sales resulting in five monetization events. The $168.2 million increase in the net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to: (i) a $249.4 million increase in net proceeds from the sale of finance receivables due to management's decision to complete more direct assets sales in 2016 as compared to 2015, (ii) a $122.7 million decrease in purchases of finance receivables reflecting lower TRB purchase volume in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, (iii) a $125.0 million change in restricted cash and investments due to the timing and structure of monetization events in the fourth quarters of 2016, 2015 and 2014, (iv) a $58.5 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities resulting from the Home Lending segment's originations and purchases of mortgages held for sale (net of proceeds from the sale of and principal payments on mortgage loans held for sale), and (v) a $22.7 million decrease in the collections on finance receivables.\nTotal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $487.0 million, an increase of $110.4 million, or 29.3%, from expenses of $376.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDecember 31, 2015. The $11.4 million increase was primarily attributable to a $11.3 million increase in interest expense associated with our VIE securitized debt that resulted from an increase in the average outstanding balance between periods, coupled with an increase in the interest rate used to calculate interest expense.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we re-evaluated our projections for our Structured Settlements segment based on lower than anticipated results that were included in the prior year's annual impairment test and a continued decline in the stock price of our Class A common stock. Accordingly, we determined these events constituted a triggering event requiring the Company to test the indefinite-lived trade name and finite-lived customer-relationships intangible assets acquired in connection with the 2011 acquisition of OAC for potential impairment. As a result of this analysis, we determined the trade name and the customer-relationships intangible assets within the Structured Settlements reporting unit were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $5.5 million in our consolidated statements of operations. The $5.5 million impairment charge was comprised of the following: (i) a $2.8 million write-down of the trade name and (ii) a $2.7 million write-down of the finite-lived customer relationships. We also determined that the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets within the Structured Settlements reporting unit were less than previously assigned and consequently revised them to their currently estimated useful lives of approximately three years. We also determined in connection with this analysis that the trade name is a finite-lived asset.\nConsolidated Liquidity Needs\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $269.6 million, a decrease of $224.7 million, or 45.5%, from revenues of $494.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $221.1 million decrease in realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long-term debt and derivatives and a $5.5 million increase in realized and unrealized losses on marketable securities.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nUnder ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure (\"ASC 820\"), fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurement establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value. These three levels of fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 included the impact of an $88.9 million increase in restricted cash that primarily related to the net effect of the following: (a) both 2013-3 securitization's initial close and pre-funding occurring in the fourth quarter of 2013 and (b) our 2014-3 securitization's initial close occurring in the fourth quarter of 2014 but the associated pre-funding occurring in the first quarter of 2015. As a result of the timing of the 2013-3 and 2014-3 pre-fundings, restricted cash increased $71.8 million between December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.\n\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $(11.0) million and $191.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $202.9 million change was primarily attributable to: (i) a $177.0 million decrease in proceeds received from the issuance of VIE long-term debt resulting from our decision to complete two direct asset sales and one securitization in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to three securitization transactions and one direct asset sale in the year ended December 31, 2015, and includes the impact of the issuance of $207.5 million of notes payable collateralized by the residual asset cash flows and reserve cash related to 36 of our securitizations, and (ii) a $133.5 million increase in repayments of long-term debt and derivatives primarily related to the $131.4 million repayment in September 2016 of our previous $133.0 million residual term facility (\"Residual Term Facility\"), partially offset by (i) a $93.6 million increase in proceeds (net of repayments) from our revolving credit facilities and (ii) a $14.5 million reduction in purchases of treasury stock.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments (excluding interest rate swaps which are discussed in \"Derivatives and Other Hedging Instruments\") as of December 31, 2016, and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. The table also reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding debt based on scheduled and/or expected repayment dates and the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2016. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as referenced in the table:\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe acquire receivables associated with structured settlement payments from individuals in exchange for cash, and these receivables are carried at fair value in VIE finance receivables, at fair value, and Other finance receivables, at fair value, on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Unearned income is calculated as the amount the fair value exceeds the cost basis of the receivables. Unearned income on VIE and other finance receivables is recognized as interest income using the effective interest method over the life of the related structured settlement. Changes in fair value are recorded in realized and unrealized gains on VIE and other finance receivables, long- term debt and derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations.\n (a) Included in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereof. \n\nRealized and unrealized gains on marketable securities, net, was a $4.1 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2016, a favorable change from the $4.6 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to higher investment returns on marketable securities. The increase was primarily offset by a corresponding increase in installment obligations expense (income), net. These amounts relate to the marketable securities and installment obligations payable on our consolidated balance sheets. The marketable securities are owned by us but are held to fully offset our installment obligations liability. Therefore, increases or decreases in gains on marketable securities do not impact our net income.\n\nThe net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interests represents the portion of (loss) earnings attributable to the economic interests in JGW LLC held by the non-controlling Common Interestholders. The $101.8 million net loss attributable to non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2015 represents the non-controlling interests' 48.3% weighted average economic interest in JGW LLC's net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $65.4 million net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2014 represents the non-controlling interests' 55.7% weighted average economic interest in JGW LLC's net income for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense, which includes interest on our securitization and other VIE long-term debt, warehouse facilities and our term loan, increased by 5.5% to $218.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $207.1 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016 compared to an overall effective rate of 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the overall effective tax rate was due primarily to the impact of the $121.6 million impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets recorded in 2015 and the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $11.9 million in 2016 due to the uncertainty that it will fully benefit from the losses incurred during the current and prior years. The Company is recording certain deferred tax liabilities as it is now required to file tax returns in jurisdictions where it has no offsetting loss carryforwards.\nThe $2.1 million decrease in realized gains on notes receivable, at fair value resulted from the repayment of a note receivable during the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nTotal realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $55.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease of $263.5 million, or 27.0%, in guaranteed and life contingent structured settlement, annuity and lottery TRB purchases, from $976.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $713.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe $1.8 million increase in unrealized losses on securitized finance receivables, debt and derivatives was primarily the result of: (i) a $9.4 million unfavorable change in the unrealized gain (loss) on the securitized finance receivables, debt and derivatives associated with the Peachtree Structured Settlements LLC permanent financing facility primarily due to an early amortization event that occurred during the first quarter of 2016 which resulted in future excess cash flows being applied to the prepayment of the outstanding debt and derivatives and (ii) a $9.1 million unfavorable change in the unrealized gain (loss) on other securitized finance receivables (other than the associated residual interests), securitized debt and derivatives resulting principally from movements in the fair value discount rates used to value these items, partially offset by a $16.7 million favorable change in the unrealized loss on our residual interests as a result of movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.\nCash Flows\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This ASU clarifies the definition of a business, which consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs. This ASU provides a framework to evaluate when an input and a substantive process are present and narrows the definition of the term outputs to be consistent with how it is described in Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. When substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset, the assets acquired would not represent a business. This ASU introduces an initial required screen that, if met, eliminates the need for further assessment. This ASU is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods and for all other entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nTotal realized and unrealized gains on unsecuritized finance receivables represent: (i) unrealized gains and losses on finance receivables acquired from customers prior to their securitization and (ii) realized gains and losses on finance receivables acquired from customers resulting from their inclusion in direct asset sale transactions.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 320): Restricted Cash. This ASU clarifies the presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows as it will be included with cash and cash equivalents, which eliminates diversity in practice. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years and for all other entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe $160.8 million change in unrealized (losses) gains on securitized finance receivables, debt and derivatives was primarily the result of: (i) an unfavorable movement in the fair value interest rate used to value our residual interest cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a favorable movement in the associated fair value interest rate during the year ended December 31, 2014. Specifically, the discount rate used to fair value our residual interests increased from 5.97% as of December 31, 2014 to 8.30% as of December 31, 2015 as result of the widening of spreads in the asset-backed securities market during 2015. In comparison, the discount rate used to fair value our residual interests decreased from 7.85% as of December 31, 2013 to 5.97% at December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of both the decrease in spreads in the asset-backed securities market and in long term interest rates in general during 2014, both of which are used in the calculation of the fair value discount rate used to estimate the fair value of our residual interest cash flows.\nThe Company generates cash by purchasing payment streams which we subsequently securitize, sell or otherwise finance in transactions that are structured to generate cash proceeds to us that exceed the purchase price we paid for those payment streams. For Structured Settlements these payment streams are generally structured settlements, annuities and lottery winnings. For Home Lending we purchase mortgage loans and sell these loans with servicing retained or released.\nWe have historically undertaken non-recourse term securitizations or direct asset sales once we have aggregated in our warehouse facilities a sufficient amount of structured settlement and annuity payment streams to undertake a securitization. At the close of each such transaction, the outstanding amount under each of the warehouse facilities is repaid. The amount of net proceeds we receive from securitizations or direct asset sales is typically in excess of the amount of funds required to repay the warehouse facilities, resulting in a positive cash flow at the time of securitization. In 2016, we completed five monetization events that consisted of two direct asset sales (each consisting of an initial close and prefunding transaction) and the initial close of a securitization. The first direct asset sale consisted of $161.3 million in discounted TRB purchases based on a deal discount rate of 5.02% and was comprised of two asset pools. The first pool, which closed on February 18, 2016, consisted of $91.3 million in discounted TRB purchases and generated net proceeds to us of $27.0 million. The second pool, which closed on April 21, 2016, consisted of $70.0 million in discounted TRB purchases and generated net proceeds to us of $21.6 million. The second direct asset sale in 2016 consisted of $110.8 million in discounted TRB purchases and was also comprised of two asset pools. The first pool, which closed on June 17, 2016, consisted of $50.8 million in discounted TRB purchases based on a deal discount rate of 4.85% and generated net proceeds to us of $18.2 million. The second pool, which closed on August 19, 2016, consisted of $59.2 million in discounted TRB purchases and generated net proceeds to us of $20.1 million. On October 26, 2016, we completed the initial close associated with our 2016-1 securitization with an aggregate note issuance amount of $117.3 million and a deal discount rate of 3.89% which generated net proceeds to us of $16.5 million. On January 20, 2017, we completed the pre-funding associated with the 2016-1 securitization which generated net proceeds to us of $15.9 million. On March 22, 2017, we completed the initial close associated with our 2017-1 securitization with an aggregate note issuance amount of $131.8 million and a deal discount rate of 4.35% which generated net proceeds to us of $15.1 million.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe above conditions could cause certain assets and liabilities to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 3 or reclassified from Level 2 to Level 3. The inputs or methodology used for valuing the assets or liabilities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with the assets and liabilities.\nQuarterly Financial Data\nInterest expense, which includes interest on our securitization and other VIE long-term debt, warehouse facilities and our term loan, increased by 3.1% to $207.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $200.8 million for the year ended\n\nIn the first half of 2016, we focused on improving performance of our Structured Settlements business, maintaining adequate liquidity through funding source optimization and rigorous expense controls while continuing to grow our Home Lending business. Within our Structured Settlements business, we completed our turnaround strategy in our marketing and operations functions which enabled us to reduce costs while achieving higher conversion rates. During the second half of 2016, we concentrated on continuing to grow our market share in the Home Lending business through operational scale while focusing on capital market execution and anticipating changes in the interest rate environment. Our Home Lending business achieved record closed loan volume originations of $3.4 billion as a result of our strong affinity relationships that leveraged the strength of our brand name. We continued to access the capital markets through the execution of a securitization of our structured settlements assets and completed direct asset sales to extract what we believe was the maximum profitability based on current market conditions and underlying economics. During 2016, we completed the initial close and subsequent pre-funding transactions associated with two direct asset sales generating an aggregate of $87.0 million in net cash proceeds and the initial close associated with a securitization transaction which generated $17.6 million in net cash proceeds. In addition, we issued $207.5 million in notes collateralized by the residual asset cash flows and reserve cash associated with 36 of the Company's previously executed securitizations, which generated $65.9 million in net cash proceeds. Our payment solutions group also expanded its channels and offerings to include solutions for the lottery and gaming industries. As of December 31, 2016, our payment solutions group was still in the early stage of development and had not generated significant revenues.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in the business combination, and is accounted for under ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC 350\"). Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment at the reporting-unit level on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates. We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for impairment is necessary. The initial qualitative approach assesses whether the existence of events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, the two step quantitative impairment test is performed. A step 1 analysis involves calculating the fair value of the associated reporting unit and comparing it to the reporting unit's carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill and the carrying value of the reporting unit is positive, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, step 2 of the impairment test must be performed. Step 2 involves calculating and comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value. Impairment is recognized if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its net book value. Such loss is calculated as the difference between the estimated implied fair value of goodwill and its carrying amount.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $191.9 million and $396.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The $204.7 million decrease was primarily attributable to a $280.7 million decrease in proceeds received from the issuance of securitization and other VIE long-term debt combined with a $10.0 million increase in purchases of treasury stock, partially offset by: (i) a $45.2 million increase in proceeds (net of repayments) from our revolving credit facilities, and (ii) a $38.1 million reduction in the repayment of securitization and other VIE long-term debt and derivatives.\nRevenues\nReconciliation of our Segments' Net Loss (Income) to Net (Loss) Income Attributable to The J.G. Wentworth Company\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test and modifies the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. An entity no longer will determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. An entity should apply the amendments in this update on a prospective basis. This ASU is effective for public business entities for their annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, for public business entities that are not SEC filers for their annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and for all other entities for their annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nProfessional and consulting costs increased to $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to $3.8 million in third-party fees incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of Home Lending and the reorganization of our structured settlement purchasing organization, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in legal expense.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments, which relates to how and when the acquiring entity recognizes adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period. This ASU eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for these adjustments to their respective provisional amount with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. This ASU becomes effective for public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2015 and for non-public entities in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nGain on extinguishment of debt, net, was $0.6 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2015 gain resulted from the early repayment of the 2004-A securitization debt. The associated finance receivables were included in the 2015-1 securitization. In 2014, we repaid approximately $6.1 million of long-term debt issued by the 2002-A securitization and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of $0.3 million.\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE or whether we have acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. The reassessment also considers whether we have acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be significant to the VIE. As a result of this assessment, the consolidation status of the legal entities with which we are involved may change.\nOur Home Lending segment typically holds its mortgage loan inventory for 30 to 45 days with these warehouse facilities until the loans are sold to take-out investors or securitized directly with Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, at which time the amount outstanding with the warehouse facilities are repaid.\nRevenues\nThe securitization or sales of the purchased assets in Structured Settlements are normally structured with an \"initial close\" in which we issue the principal amount of securitized debt and receive: (i) cash in exchange for assets delivered and (ii) restricted cash in exchange for assets to be delivered 60 to 90 days in the future (referred to as the \"pre-funding\" date). On the pre-funding date, additional assets are delivered to the lenders in return for the lifting of restrictions on the restricted cash. As a result of structuring the securitizations in this fashion, our restricted cash balances have fluctuated significantly depending on the timing of the transactions' initial close and their associated pre-funding dates. We refer to each of these transactions as a monetization event. Historically, securitizations or direct asset sales have generally had two monetization events. For our 2015-3 securitization and our single 2015 direct asset sale, we opted not to have a pre-funding date, but instead had only a single monetization event: the initial close. In 2014, we completed five monetization events that were comprised of: (i) two securitizations which each had two monetization events during the calendar year and (ii) one securitization for which the initial close occurred in 2014 and the pre-funding occurred in 2015. In 2015, we completed seven monetization events which were comprised of: (i) the pre-funding from the securitization which completed the initial close in 2014, (ii) two direct assets sales which each had two monetization events in the calendar year, (iii) one direct asset sale which completed a single monetization event, and (iv) one securitization which also completed only a single monetization event. In 2016, we completed five monetization events which were comprised of: (i) two direct assets sales which each had two monetization events and (ii) one securitization for which the initial close was completed in 2016 and the pre-funding in 2017.\nNet cash provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the impact of $58.7 million increase in restricted cash that primarily related to the net effect of the following: (i) our 2015-3 securitization being structured with only an initial close and not having a pre-funding component and (ii) our 2016-1 securitization's initial close occurring in the fourth quarter of 2016 but the associated pre-funding occurring in the first quarter of 2017. As a result of the timing and the structure of the 2015-3 and 2016-1 securitizations, restricted cash increased by $58.8 million between December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016.\nIn conjunction with the implementation of the credit risk retention rules mandated by Dodd-Frank, we expect the total net cash proceeds to be received by the Company for each securitization in the Structured Settlement segment to be less than would have been received absent the application of such rules.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the liability method of accounting in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of the differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThese credit facilities are generally renewed annually for a period of 12 months and represent secured lending facilities with our originated mortgage loans serving as collateral. In addition, our lenders require pledge fund deposits of approximately one percent of the facility's capacity be maintained with the lender. Without these facilities we would not be able to meet our short-term liquidity requirements to operate our Home Lending segment.\nWe analyze our tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state and local tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, we determine that uncertainties\nCompensation and benefits expense decreased to $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to (i) a $3.5 million decrease in incentive compensation expense and (ii) a $1.1 million reduction in share-based compensation expense, which was partially offset by (a) a $1.0 million increase in severance expense related to the departure of several senior executives during the year ended 2015, including our former President and Chief Operating Officer, and (b) higher labor costs necessary to execute on our strategy of entering new lines of business and improving our information, data and analytic capabilities.\nOur Home Lending segment's results for the year ended December 31, 2016 are not directly comparable to the same period in the prior year since we acquired Home Lending on July 31, 2015. As a result, only five months of Home Lending's results of operations were included in the prior year's reporting period.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-entity transfers of Assets Other than Inventory. This ASU removes the current exception in U.S. GAAP prohibiting entities from recognizing current and deferred income tax expenses or benefits related to transfer of assets, other than inventory, within the consolidated entity. The current exception to defer the recognition of any tax impact on the transfer of inventory within the consolidated entity until it is sold to a third party remains unaffected. This ASU is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and for all other entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim reporting periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted and should be in the first interim period if an entity issues interim financial statements. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nSecuritization and Permanent Financing Debt, at Fair Value\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, at the commencement date of each lease. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. This ASU is effective for all entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments of this update should be applied using a modified retrospective approach, which requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nThe provision for losses represents estimates of losses to be incurred on the repurchase or indemnification of purchasers of mortgage loans. Certain sales contract and GSE standards require us to repurchase a loan or indemnify the purchaser or insurer for losses if a borrower fails to make initial loan payments or if the accompanying mortgage loan fails to meet certain customary representations and warranties, such as the nature and extent of underwriting standards. In the event of a breach of the representations and warranties, we may be required to either repurchase the loan or indemnify the purchaser for losses it sustains on the loan. We record a provision for estimated repurchases and loss indemnification on loans sold, which is charged to the provision for losses. In addition, the provision for losses also includes a reserve for potential losses related to impaired loans within our servicing portfolio, which include various factors such historical loss experience, actual write-offs during the period, known delinquent loans and GSE guidelines.\nDebt issuance costs decreased to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $5.1 million of debt issuance costs incurred in the year ended December 31, 2016 related to: (i) $0.5 million in fees to amend certain provisions of our previously issued securitization debt, (ii) $2.6 million in fees paid in connection with the issuance of $207.5 million of notes payable that are collateralized by the residual asset cash flows and reserve cash related to 36 of our securitizations, and (iii) $2.0 million in fees paid related to the 2016-1 securitization transaction that closed in October 2016. The $6.7 million of debt issuance costs incurred in the year ended December 31, 2015 related to fees incurred in connection with three securitization transactions that closed during 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we issued $117.3 million in securitized debt, a decrease of $358.6 million from the $475.9 million in securitized debt issued in 2015, due primarily to the Company electing to complete two direct asset sales in the first nine months of 2016 which do not result in the issuance of securitized debt. Underwriting fees associated with our securitizations are calculated as a percentage of the principal amount of debt issued.\nInterest income principally relates to our mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, which is recognized in income prior to the loan being sold, and is based on the principal amount outstanding and contractual interest rates.\nWe recorded a consolidated income tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2015 of $18.2 million compared to a provision for income taxes of $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our overall effective tax rate was 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to an overall effective rate of 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The reduction in the overall effective tax rate was due primarily to the impact of the permanent differences between book and taxable income (loss), including the $121.6 million impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets recorded in 2015.\n\nheld for sale), and (v) a $21.9 million increase in net proceeds from the sale of finance receivables.\nHome Lending's general and administrative expense primarily represents the cost to lease and operate the segment's headquarters in Woodbridge, Virginia and the various retail and direct lending call center offices across the country.\nNewly acquired finance receivable assets are accounted for at fair value until they are securitized or disposed of pursuant to a direct asset sale. Subsequent to acquisition but prior to securitization or sale, the Company generally borrows against purchased finance receivables pursuant to one of its revolving credit facilities. When the Company borrows against its finance receivables, it transfers the encumbered assets into a VIE. If the finance receivables are securitized, immediately prior to securitization, the securitized assets are adjusted to their current fair value and the resulting change in fair value is included in gains/(losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one. If the finance receivables are included in a direct asset sale, the previously recognized unrealized gains/(losses) are reversed and the difference between the purchase price and sales price is recorded as a realized gain and included in gains/(losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one. The difference between the price paid to acquire finance receivables and their fair value at the end of the month acquired is referred to as \"day one gains\". Changes in fair value of finance receivables acquired in prior months are referred to as \"gains (losses) from changes in fair value subsequent to day one\".\nNet cash used in investing activities was $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $56.3 million change was primarily due to: (i) $47.4 million of net cash used to acquire our Home Lending segment in 2015 and (ii) the collection of a $6.1 million note receivable in 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $80.2 million. Our primary source of funds for the Structured Settlements and Home Lending segments include secured borrowings in the form of warehouse lines of credit and revolving credit facilities with financial institutions. These credit facilities are generally renewed for a period of 12 to 18 months. In the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our financing needs and adjust our aggregate borrowing capacity in light of current and projected business needs and market conditions. Although we have historically been able to renew or replace these facilities in advance of their maturity to ensure our ongoing liquidity and access to capital, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. Further, it is likely that GNMA will place restrictions on the cash generated by Home Lending such that it can only be used for Home Lending's operations and cannot be used for corporate-level purposes. Due to the risk retention rules from Dodd-Frank, in the future we will need to retain an additional portion of the credit risk of the assets which will result in less cash available at each securitization. Despite this restriction, we believe our cash on hand and cash generated from the purchase and subsequent securitization or direct asset sale of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams will allow us to meet our current and future liquidity needs over the next 12 months. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to securitize or sell our payment streams or mortgage loans at favorable rates. We may also consider selling our pre-settlement assets or financing these or other uncollateralized assets.\nOn September 2, 2016, the Company repaid the $131.4 million outstanding balance on the Residual Term Facility through the issuance of $207.5 million of notes payable collateralized by the residual asset cash flows and reserve cash related to 36 of our securitizations. The Company incurred $0.4 million in debt termination costs and expensed $3.3 million of unamortized debt issuance costs during the three months ended September 30, 2016 in connection with the termination of this facility, which were included in interest expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\nWe elected fair value treatment under Accounting Standards Codification 810, Financial Instruments (\"ASC 810\"), to measure the VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts and related VIE finance receivables. We have determined that measurement of the VIE long-term debt issued by securitization and permanent financing trusts at fair value better correlates with the fair value of the VIE finance receivables held by special purpose entities (\"SPEs\"), which are held to provide the cash flow for the note obligations. The debt issued by our VIE securitization and permanent financing trusts is recourse only to the respective entities that issued the debt and is non-recourse to the Company and its other subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries continue to receive fees for servicing the securitized assets which are eliminated in consolidation. In addition, the risk to our non-SPE subsidiaries from SPE losses is limited to cash reserves, residual interest amounts and repurchases of structured settlement payment streams that are subsequently determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the securitization or permanent financing trusts.", "item_7_tables": "Table 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
