MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d).\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are not statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events or our future financial or operating performance. Words such as anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d may,\u201d plan,\u201d seek\u201d and similar terms and phrases, or the negative thereof, may be used to identify forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on management's good-faith belief and reasonable judgment based on current information. The forward-looking statements are qualified by important factors, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including those described above in Item 1A Risk Factors and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date hereof or as of the date specified herein. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by any applicable laws or regulations.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are an insurance holding company that markets and services our product offerings through specialty commercial and specialty personal insurance business lines. Our growth has been significant since our founding in 2009. Currently, we are authorized to write insurance as an excess and surplus lines carrier in 44 states, we are licensed to write insurance in 40 states as an admitted carrier and we offer our insurance products in all 50 states.\nOur revenues are primarily derived from premiums earned from our insurance operations. We also generate other revenues through investment income and other income which mainly consists of: installment fees and policy issuance fees generally related to the policies we write and commission income from SIA's 50% owned agency (the \"Affiliate\"). The Affiliate places small commercial risks mainly for alarm and security guard markets.\nOur expenses consist primarily of losses and loss adjustment expenses, agents' commissions, and other underwriting and administrative expenses. We organize our operations in two insurance businesses: commercial insurance lines and personal insurance lines.\nThrough our commercial insurance lines, we offer coverage for both commercial property and commercial liability. We also offer coverage for commercial automobiles and workers' compensation. Our insurance policies are sold to targeted small and mid-sized businesses on a single or multiple-coverage basis.\nThrough our personal insurance lines, we offer homeowners insurance and dwelling fire insurance products to individuals in several states. Our specialty homeowners insurance line is primarily comprised of either wind-exposed homeowners insurance providing hurricane and wind coverage to underserved homeowners in Texas, Hawaii and Florida or low-value dwelling insurance tailored for owners of lower valued homes, which we have historically offered in Illinois and Indiana, and have now expanded to Louisiana and Texas (where we have an office in Waco). Due to recent Florida-based industry events, we have been de-emphasizing our Florida homeowners' business and reducing our exposures in that state. Otherwise, there has been little change in our approach to managing or evaluating these lines.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nWe identified the accounting estimates below as critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those estimates that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to exercise significant judgment. We use significant judgment concerning future results and developments in applying these critical accounting estimates and in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of material contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from the estimates and\nassumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates regularly using information that we believe to be relevant. See the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further details.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nOur recorded loss and loss adjustment expenses (\"LAE\") reserves represent management's best estimate of unpaid loss and LAE at each balance sheet date, based on information, facts and circumstances known at such time. Our loss and LAE reserves reflect our estimates at the balance sheet date of the following items:\n\u2022 Case reserves, which are unpaid loss and LAE amounts we expect to pay for losses that have been reported; and\n\u2022 Incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\") reserves, which are (1) unpaid loss and LAE amounts we expect to pay for losses that have been incurred but not yet reported; and (2) the expected development of losses and LAE on open reported cases.\nWe do not discount the loss and LAE reserves for the time value of money.\nCase reserves for reported losses and LAE are initially set by our claims personnel. When a claim is reported to us, our claims department completes a case-basis valuation and establishes a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment as soon as practicable and after it has sufficient information to form a judgment about the probable ultimate losses and LAE associated with that claim, with a goal of setting the case reserve at the ultimate expected loss and LAE amount. Our claims department updates their case-basis valuations upon receipt of additional information. The case reserve is based primarily upon an evaluation of the following factors:\n\u2022 The type of loss;\n\u2022 The severity of injury or damage;\n\u2022 Our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim;\n\u2022 The jurisdiction of the occurrence;\n\u2022 Policy provisions related to the claim;\n\u2022 Expenses intended to cover the ultimate cost of settling claims, including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting from such claims, costs of outside adjusters and experts, and all other expenses which are identified to the case; and\n\u2022 Any other information considered pertinent to estimating the indemnity and expense exposure presented by the claim.\nIBNR reserves are determined by subtracting case reserves from total estimated loss and LAE reserves, which are based on the ultimate expected losses and LAE less paid loss and LAE. Our actuarial department develops estimated ultimate loss and LAE on a quarterly basis. Our Reserve Review Committee (which includes our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, other members of executive management, and key actuarial, underwriting and claims personnel) meets each quarter to review our actuaries' estimated ultimate expected loss and LAE.\nThe carried reserves reflect management's best estimate of the outstanding loss and LAE liabilities. Management arrives at this estimate after reviewing an internal analysis prepared by the Company's certified actuary.\nWe use several generally accepted actuarial methods to develop estimated ultimate loss and LAE estimates by line of business and accident year. This process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends, is a reasonable basis for predicting future outcomes. These methods utilize various inputs, including but not limited to:\n\u2022 Written and earned premiums;\n\u2022 Paid and reported losses and LAE;\n\u2022 Expected initial loss and LAE ratio, which is the ratio of incurred losses and LAE to earned premiums; and\n\u2022 Expected claim reporting and payout patterns based on our own loss experience and supplemented with insurance industry data where applicable.\nThe principal standard actuarial methods used by our actuaries for their comprehensive reviews include:\n\u2022 Loss ratio method-This method uses loss and LAE ratios for prior accident years, adjusted for current trends, to determine an appropriate expected loss and LAE ratio for a given accident year;\n\u2022 Loss development methods-Loss development methods assume that the losses and LAE yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss and LAE amounts observed to-date. The paid loss development method uses losses and LAE paid to date, while the reported loss development method uses losses and LAE reported to date;\n\u2022 Bornheutter-Ferguson method-This method is a combination of the loss ratio and loss development methods, where the loss development factor is given more weight as an accident year matures; and\n\u2022 Frequency/severity method-This method projects claim counts and average cost per claim on a paid or reported basis for high frequency, low severity products.\nOur actuaries give different weights to each of these methods based upon the amount of historical experience data by line of business and by accident year, and based on judgment as to what method is believed to result in the most accurate estimate. The application of each method by line of business and by accident year may change in the future if it is determined that a different emphasis for each method would result in more accurate estimates.\nOur actuaries also analyze several diagnostic measures by line of business and accident year, including but not limited to: reported and closed frequency and severity, claim reporting and claim closing patterns, paid and incurred loss ratio development, and ratios of paid loss and LAE to incurred loss and LAE. After the actuarial methods and diagnostic measures have been performed and analyzed, our actuaries use their judgment and expertise to select an estimated ultimate loss and LAE by line of business and by accident year.\nOur actuaries estimate an IBNR reserve for our unallocated LAE not specifically identified to a particular claim, namely our internal claims department salaries and associated general overhead and administrative expenses associated with the adjustment and processing of claims. These estimates, which are referred to as unallocated loss adjustment expense (\"ULAE\") reserves, are based on internal cost studies and analyses reflecting the relationship of ULAE paid to actual paid and incurred losses. We select factors that are applied to case reserves and IBNR reserve estimates in order to estimate the amount of ULAE reserves applicable to estimated loss reserves at the balance sheet date.\nWe allocate the applicable portion of our estimated loss and LAE reserves to amounts recoverable from reinsurers under reinsurance contracts and report those amounts separately from our loss and LAE reserves as an asset on our balance sheet.\nThe estimation of ultimate liability for losses and LAE is a complex, imprecise and inherently uncertain process, and therefore involves a considerable degree of judgment and expertise. Our loss and LAE reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability, but are estimates based upon various factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022 Actuarial projections of what we, at a given time, expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims reflecting facts and circumstances then known;\n\u2022 Estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency;\n\u2022 Assessment of asserted theories of liability; and\n\u2022 Analysis of other factors, such as variables in claims handling procedures, economic factors, and judicial and legislative trends and actions.\nMost or all of these factors are not directly or precisely quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis, and are subject to a significant degree of variability over time. In addition, the establishment of loss and LAE reserves makes no provision for the broadening of coverage by legislative action or judicial interpretation or for the extraordinary future emergence of new types of losses not sufficiently represented in our historical experience or which cannot yet be quantified. As a result, an integral component of our loss and LAE reserving process is the use of informed subjective estimates and judgments about our ultimate exposure to losses and LAE. Accordingly, the ultimate liability may be more or less than the current estimate. The effects of change in the estimated loss and LAE reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimate is revised.\nOur reserves consist entirely of reserves for property and liability losses, consistent with the coverages provided for in the insurance policies directly written or assumed by us under reinsurance contracts. Occasionally, several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of the loss. The level of IBNR reserves in relation to total reserves depends upon the characteristics of the specific line of business, particularly related to the speed with which claims are reported and outstanding claims are paid. Lines of business for which claims are reported slowly will have a higher percentage of IBNR reserves than lines of business that report and settle claims more quickly.\nThe following table shows the ratio of IBNR reserves to total reserves net of reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of Business\n</td> <td>Case\nReserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IBNR\nReserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nReserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ratio of\nIBNR to\nTotal\nReserves\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Lines\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal Lines\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Lines\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough we believe that our reserve estimates are reasonable, it is possible that our actual loss and LAE experience may not conform to our assumptions and may, in fact, vary significantly from our assumptions. Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses and the related LAE may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements. We continually review our estimates and adjust them as we believe appropriate as our experience develops or new information becomes known to us. Such adjustments are included in current operations.\nOur loss and LAE reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability, but are estimates. The most significant assumptions affecting our IBNR reserve estimates are the loss development factors applied to paid losses and case reserves to develop IBNR by line of business and accident year. Although historical loss development provides us with an indication of future loss development, it typically varies from year to year. Thus, for each accident year within each line of business we select one loss development factor out of a range of historical factors.\nWe generated a sensitivity analysis of our net reserves which represents reasonably likely levels of variability in our selected loss development factors. We believe the most meaningful approach to the sensitivity analysis is to vary the loss development factors that drive the ultimate loss and LAE estimates. We applied this approach on an accident year basis, reflecting the reasonably likely differences in variability by level of maturity of the underlying loss experience for each accident year. Generally, the most recent accident years are characterized by more unreported losses and less information available for settling claims, and have more inherent uncertainty than the reserve estimates for more mature accident years. Therefore, we used variability factors of plus or minus 10% for the most recent accident year, 5% for the preceding accident year, and 2.5% for the second preceding accident year. There is minimal expected variability for accident years at four or more years' maturity.\nThe following table displays ultimate net loss and LAE and net loss and LAE reserves by accident year for the year ended December 31, 2016. We applied the sensitivity factors to each accident year amount and have calculated the amount of potential net loss and LAE reserve change and the impact on 2016 reported pre-tax income and on net income and shareholders' equity at December 31, 2016. We believe it is not appropriate to sum the illustrated amounts as it is not reasonably likely that each accident year's reserve estimate assumptions will vary simultaneously in the same direction to the full extent of the sensitivity factor. We also believe that such changes to our reserve balance would not have a material impact on our operating results, financial position, or liquidity. The net income and shareholders' equity amounts include an income tax rate assumption of 34%. The dollar amounts in the table are in thousands.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Ultimate\nLoss and LAE\nSensitivity\nFactor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\nUltimate\nLoss and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\nLoss and LAE\nReserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Potential\nImpact on\n2016 Pre-\nTax Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Potential\nImpact on 2016\nNet Income and\nDecember 31, 2016\nShareholders'\nEquity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increased Ultimate Losses & LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident Year 2016\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident Year 2015\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident Year 2014\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>712\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Prior Accident Years\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decreased Ultimate Losses & LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident Year 2016\n</td> <td>(10.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,836\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,192\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident Year 2015\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,150\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,419\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident Year 2014\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,079\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(712\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Prior Accident Years\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Valuation and Impairment\nWe carry fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available-for-sale at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses on such securities, net of any deferred taxes, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not have any securities classified as trading or held-to-maturity.\nWe evaluate our available-for-sale investments regularly to determine whether there have been declines in value that are other-than-temporary. Our outside investment managers assist us in this evaluation. When we determine that a security has experienced an other-than-temporary impairment, the impairment loss is recognized as a realized investment loss.\nWe consider a number of factors in assessing whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including (1) the amount and percentage that current fair value is below cost or amortized cost, (2) the length of time that the fair value has been below cost or amortized cost and (3) recent corporate developments or other factors that may impact an issuer's near term prospects. In addition, for fixed maturity securities, we also consider the credit quality ratings for the securities, with a special emphasis on securities downgraded to below investment grade. We also consider our intent to sell available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position, and if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before a recovery in fair value to their cost or amortized cost basis. For equity securities, we evaluate the near-term prospect of these investments in relation to the severity and duration of the impairment, and we consider our ability and intent to hold these investments until they recover their fair value.\nFair values are measured in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. The guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value and a three-level hierarchy based upon the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: (1) Level 1: inputs are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (2) Level 2: inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability and (3) Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. The unobservable inputs represent the Company's best assumption of how market participants would price the assets or liabilities.\nThe fair values of fixed maturity securities and equity securities have been determined using fair value prices provided by our investment managers, who utilize internationally recognized independent pricing services. The prices provided by the independent pricing services are generally based on observable market data in active markets (e.g., broker quotes and prices observed for comparable securities).\nThe values for publicly-traded equity securities are generally based on Level 1 inputs which use the market approach valuation technique. The values for fixed maturity securities generally incorporate significant Level 2 inputs. The carrying value of cash and short-term investments approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturity.\nWe review fair value prices provided by our outside investment managers for reasonableness by comparing the fair values provided by the managers to those provided by our investment custodian. We also review and monitor changes in unrealized gains and losses. We obtain an understanding of the methods, models and inputs used by our investment managers and independent pricing services, and controls are in place to validate that prices provided represent fair values. Our control process includes initial and ongoing evaluation of the methodologies used, a review of specific securities and an assessment for proper classification within the fair value hierarchy.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous state jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income or loss.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have federal and state income tax net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards of $22.8 million and $8.7 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates from 2019 through 2036. Of the federal NOL amount, $15.1 million are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. These net NOL carryforwards are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized. At this time we do not expect that any of the remaining NOL carryforwards will expire before utilized.\nThe carrying value of our gross deferred tax asset for the NOL carryforwards is equal to the total NOL carryforward amount times the applicable federal and state tax rates, and was $8.0 million and $6.1 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total gross deferred tax assets were $13.0 million and $9.8 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. A valuation allowance of $8.4 million and $5.2 million has been recorded against the gross deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as the Company has recognized a three year cumulative loss as of December 31, 2016 which is significant negative evidence to support the lack of recoverability of those deferred tax assets in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. The net deferred tax liability was $179 thousand and $325 thousand as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIf, in the future, we determine we can support the recoverability of a portion or all of the deferred tax assets under the guidance, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense and result in an increase in equity. Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Income Per Share\nAdjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are non-GAAP measures that represent net income allocable to common shareholders excluding net realized investment and other gains (losses), net of tax, and the tax effect of changes in unrealized gains to the extent included in net income. The most directly comparable financial GAAP measures to adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are net income and net income per share, respectively. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are intended as supplemental information and are not meant to replace net income or net income per share. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. Our definition of adjusted operating income may be different from that used by other companies. The following is a reconciliation of net income to adjusted operating income (dollars in thousands), as well as net income per share to adjusted operating income per share:\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) allocable to common shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,437\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(476\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,200\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized investment gains and other gains (losses)\n</td> <td>1,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating (loss) allocable to common shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,549\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(865\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,617\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares, diluted\n</td> <td>7,618,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,369,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,672,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted (loss) per common share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) per share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.09\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.69\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized investment gains and other gains (losses) per share\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating (loss) per share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.85\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe use adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share, in conjunction with other financial measures, to assess our performance and to evaluate the results of our business. We believe these measures provide investors with valuable information relating to our ongoing performance that may be obscured by the effect of investment gains and losses as a result of our market risk sensitive instruments, which primarily relate to fixed income securities that are available for sale and not held for trading purposes. Realized investment gains and losses may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by external economic developments, such as capital market conditions. Accordingly, adjusted operating income excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from our ongoing business operations and the underlying loss or profitability of our business. We believe that it is useful for investors to evaluate adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share, along with net income and net income per share, when reviewing and evaluating our performance.\nExecutive Overview\nThe Company reported a net loss of $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $17,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net loss allocable to common shareholders was $8.4 million or $1.11 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $476,000 or $0.09 per share for the same period in 2015.\nAdjusted operating loss, a non-GAAP measure, allocable to common shareholders was $9.5 million or $1.26 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to an adjusted operating loss allocable to common shareholders of $865,000 or $0.16 per share for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOur combined ratio increased 10.1 percentage points for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 112.2%, compared to 102.1% for the same period in 2015.\nThe increase was largely attributable to an 8.2 percentage point increase in the loss ratio in 2016, compared to 2015 attributable to higher than expected losses in Florida homeowners, commercial auto, commercial liability products and the personal auto run-off. Our expense ratio increased by 1.9 percentage points for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in the expense ratio was primarily due to increased policy acquisition costs as ceding commissions from a quota share agreement reduced commission expense in the first seven months of 2015. This increase was partially offset by improved operating expense ratios as we gained efficiencies from an improved earned premium base.\nOur results for the year ended December 31, 2016 also reflect the continued expansion of our commercial lines and repositioning of our personal lines. Our commercial lines gross written premiums grew by 29.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. Gross written premiums in our personal lines grew by 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.\nResults of Operations - 2016 Compared to 2015\nThe following table

policy. All commercial lines and homeowners products have annual policies, under which premiums are earned evenly over one year. Almost all personal automobile policies are six month term policies under which premiums are earned evenly over a six-month period. The resulting net earned premiums are impacted by the gross and ceded written premiums, earned ratably over time.\nOur premiums are presented below for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):\nSummary of Premium Revenue Table 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross written premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial lines\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal lines\n</td> <td>26,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net written premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial lines\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal lines\n</td> <td>21,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Earned premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial lines\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal lines\n</td> <td>20,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross written premiums increased $21.2 million, or 22.6%, to $114.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $93.8 million for the same period in 2015. The increase was driven by continued growth in our commercial lines. These results reflect our continued execution of our growth initiatives in the niche commercial insurance markets and our strategic change in the mix of business of our personal lines.\nCommercial lines gross written premiums increased $20.0 million, or 29.4%, to $88.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily driven by expansion in the hospitality and security services product lines.\nPersonal lines gross written premiums increased $1.1 million, or 4.4%, to $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $25.6 million for the same period in 2015. This was largely driven by favorable growth of 38% in the Company's low-value dwelling product line, partially offset by reduction in gross written premiums in the Florida homeowners business as well as the personal automobile business which is in runoff.\nNet written premiums increased $20.3 million, or 25.4%, to $99.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $79.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This result is consistent with the 22.6% increase in gross written premiums.\nOther Income\nOther income consists primarily of fees charged to policyholders by the Company for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billings or policy issuance costs. Commission income is also received by the Company's insurance agencies for writing policies for third party insurance companies. Other income for the year December 31, 2016 decreased $549,000, or 32.9%, to $1.1 million as compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the deconsolidation of the Affiliate at September 30, 2015. Prior to the deconsolidation their income was recorded as other income, since then their net profit or loss has been recorded as equity earnings.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe tables below detail our losses and LAE and loss ratios for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands).\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>Commercial\nLines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Personal\nLines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident year net losses and LAE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (favorable) adverse development\n</td> <td>6,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calendar year net loss and LAE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident year loss ratio\n</td> <td>51.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (favorable) adverse development\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calendar year loss ratio\n</td> <td>61.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>Commercial\nLines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Personal\nLines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident year net losses and LAE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (favorable) adverse development\n</td> <td>365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calendar year net loss and LAE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident year loss ratio\n</td> <td>51.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (favorable) adverse development\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calendar year loss ratio\n</td> <td>51.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet losses and LAE increased by $20.1 million, or 51.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a 34.2% increase in net earned premiums and $10.2 million of unfavorable reserve development from prior years. The calendar year loss ratios were 65.0% and 56.8% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 8.2 percentage point increase in our loss ratio was primarily attributable to the reserve strengthening in our Florida homeowners, commercial automobile and commercial liability lines of business.\nOverall reserve development on prior accident years for the year ended December 31, 2016 was unfavorable by $10.2 million, or 11.3 percentage points of the loss ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2016, this was made up of $2.7 million of adverse development in both the wind-exposed homeowners and commercial auto lines of business as well as $2.6 million and $760,000 of adverse development in the hospitality line of business and personal auto lines of business, respectively.\nTotal reserve development on prior accident years for the year ended December 31, 2015 was unfavorable by $1.5 million, or 2.1 percentage points of the loss ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2015, there was $1.2 million and $835,000 of unfavorable reserve development in the personal automobile and commercial automobile lines, respectively. This unfavorable development was partially offset by $320,000, $189,000, and $101,000 of favorable reserve development in the workers' compensation line, the low-value dwelling lines and the other liability line, respectively.\nExpense Ratio\nOur expense ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and operating expenses by the sum of net earned premiums and other income. We use the expense ratio to evaluate the operating efficiency of our consolidated operations and each segment. Costs that are not readily identifiable as a direct cost of a segment or product line remain in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes.\nThe table below provides the expense ratio by major component:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>26.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>36.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>31.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>45.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>27.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>19.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>47.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur expense ratio increased by 1.9 percentage points for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in the ratio was primarily due to increased policy acquisition costs as ceding commissions from a quota share agreement reduced commission expense in the first seven months of 2015. This increase was partially offset by improved operating expense ratios as we gained efficiencies from an improved earned premium base.\nPolicy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets direct commissions with ceded commissions from reinsurers. The percentage of policy acquisition costs to net earned premiums and other income increased to 27.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 23.7% in 2015, primarily due to the termination of a quota share reinsurance agreement in August 2015, which had previously reduced commission expense from ceding commission received from the reinsurer. The Company's direct commission expense rate was consistent between 2015 and 2016.\nOperating expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, information technology and occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. Operating expenses as a percent of net earned premiums and other income was 19.4% and 21.6% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Earned premium growth on a more fixed operating expense structure has helped to reduce the operating expense ratio, which is expected to continue to decline as our earned premium grows.\nUnderwriting Results\nWe measure the performance of our consolidated results, in part, based on our underwriting gain or loss.

This increase was the result of growth of the investment portfolio and a change in the mix of investments. Average invested assets as of December 31, 2016 were $123.1 million as compared to $111.5 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $11.6 million, or 10.4%. As of December 31, 2016, the average invested asset balance was comprised of 89.4% fixed maturities, 3.6% equity securities and 7.0% short-term investments, compared to the December 31, 2015 mix of 85.8% fixed maturities, 3.8% equity securities and 10.4% short term investments.\nThe portfolio's average quality was AA at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The portfolio produced a tax equivalent book yield of 2.2% and 2.1% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was 3.2 years and 3.1 years at December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $647,000 and $769,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the decrease in outstanding borrowings in 2016 until the fourth quarter when the company drew $4.0 million on the Revolver. Prior to fourth quarter the borrowings were lower because the previously outstanding borrowings under the Revolver were repaid from the proceeds received from the Company's IPO, in August 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had $0 of current federal income tax expense due to current year losses, which can provide no benefit, and $70,000 of state income tax expense. The Company also had a deferred tax benefit of $147,000 related to a $400,000 write-off of intangible assets resulting from the merger of ACIC into WPIC in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had $0 of federal income tax expense and $48,000 of state income tax expense.\nThe Company has established an $8.4 million valuation allowance against 100% of the net deferred tax assets for 2016, which would increase book value per share by $1.10 if reversed in the future, based on current income tax rates. The valuation allowance was $5.2 million for 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $22.8 million, which expire in tax years 2019 through 2036. Of this amount, $15.1 million are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $8.7 million, which expire in tax years 2030 through 2036.\nResults of Operations - 2015 Compared to 2014\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nSummary Operating Results\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross written premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net written premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earned premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>1,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(142\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.8\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses and loss adjustment expenses, net\n</td> <td>38,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,848\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>16,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>14,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting gain (loss)\n</td> <td>(1,439\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,228\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>1,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized investment gains\n</td> <td>285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(132\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.7\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other gains\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,220\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(281\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity earnings (losses) in affiliates, net of tax\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,939\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting Ratios:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss ratio\n</td> <td>56.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expense ratio\n</td> <td>45.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>102.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Percentage change is not meaningful\nPremiums\nEarned premiums are earned ratably over the term of the policy, whereas written premiums are reflected on the effective date of the policy. All commercial lines and homeowners products have annual policies, under which premiums are earned evenly over one year. Almost all personal automobile policies are six month term policies under which premiums are earned evenly over a six-month period. The resulting net earned premiums are impacted by the gross and ceded written premiums, earned ratably over time.\nOur premiums are presented below for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nSummary of Premium Revenue\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross written premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial lines\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal lines\n</td> <td>25,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,238\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.2\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net written premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial lines\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal lines\n</td> <td>21,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,824\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Earned premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial lines\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal lines\n</td> <td>18,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,600\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.5\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross written premiums increased $9.9 million, or 11.8%, to $93.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $83.8 million for the same period in 2014. The increase was driven by continued growth in our commercial lines, offset by the run-off personal automobile line. These results reflect our continued execution of our growth initiatives in the niche commercial insurance markets and our strategic change in the mix of business of our personal lines.\nCommercial lines gross written premiums increased $13.1 million, or 23.9%, to $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $55.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily driven by the commercial multi-peril and other liability lines, which together grew by 22.1% year over year, largely due to expansion in the hospitality and security services product lines.\nPersonal lines gross written premiums decreased $3.2 million, or 11.2%, to $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $28.8 million for the same period in 2014. The premium decline was driven by the run-off of our personal automobile line in 2015, which saw a $7.3 million decline in premiums, year over year, for 2015. Partially offsetting the lower personal automobile premiums was a $4.1 million increase in premiums for our homeowners line of business. Homeowner premiums grew as a result of strategic underwriting and marketing changes to these lines implemented in late 2014. These changes favorably impacted our personal lines mix of business and drove a 40% increase in premiums in our more profitable wind-exposed business.\nNet written premiums increased $13.4 million, or 20.2%, to $79.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $66.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Of this increase, $7.3 million is due to the termination of a quota share reinsurance agreement which occurred on August 1, 2015. The quota share arrangement was terminated as management determined the Company no longer needed the leverage support of this reinsurance arrangement due to the added capital raised from the IPO. Excluding the impact of the quota share reinsurance agreement, the net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $6.1 million compared to the same period in 2014.\nOther Income\nOther income consists primarily of fees charged to policyholders by the Company for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billings or policy issuance costs. Commission income is also received by the Company's insurance agencies for writing policies for third party insurance companies. Other income for the year December 31, 2015 decreased $142,000, or 7.8%, to $1.7 million as compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe tables below detail our losses and LAE and loss ratios for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands).\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>Commercial\nLines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Personal\nLines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident year net losses and LAE\n</td> <td>25,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (favorable) adverse development\n</td> <td>364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calendar year net loss and LAE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident year loss ratio\n</td> <td>51.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (favorable) adverse development\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calendar year loss ratio\n</td> <td>51.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>Commercial\nLines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Personal\nLines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident year net losses and LAE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (favorable) adverse development\n</td> <td>(1,182\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,193\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calendar year net loss and LAE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident year loss ratio\n</td> <td>59.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (favorable) adverse development\n</td> <td>(3.3\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Calendar year loss ratio\n</td> <td>56.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet losses and LAE decreased by $1.8 million, or 4.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease in our net losses and LAE was attributable to a number of factors, including a significant reduction in weather-related property losses which were historically high in 2014, a decrease in losses in low-value dwelling resulting from our underwriting changes in late 2014, and an increase in ceded losses under the quota share reinsurance agreement. Partially offsetting these items were increases to net losses and LAE due to increases in the overall growth of our business as well as the strengthening of our commercial automobile reserves and losses in our run-off personal automobile line of business.\nThe calendar year loss ratios were 56.8% and 68.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 11.8 percentage point decrease in the loss ratio was mainly the result of lower losses in the low-value dwelling and commercial multi-peril lines. Both lines experienced losses that were historically higher in 2014 due to weather-related property damage. In addition, the mix of business continues to evolve as our lines of business with historically lower overall loss ratios grow (such as wind-exposed homeowners, and commercial liability lines), and the historically higher loss ratio businesses decline (such as low-value dwelling in the Midwest and nonstandard automobile).\nOverall reserve development on prior accident years for the year ended December 31, 2015 was unfavorable by $1.5 million, or 2.1 percentage points of the loss ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2015, there was $1.2 million and $835,000 of unfavorable reserve development in the personal automobile and commercial automobile lines, respectively. This unfavorable development was partially offset by $320,000, $189,000, and $101,000 of favorable reserve development in the workers' compensation line, the low-value dwelling lines and the other liability line, respectively.\nTotal reserve development on prior accident years for the year ended December 31, 2014 was favorable by $1.2 million, or 2.1 percentage points of the loss ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2014, there was $702,000 and $509,000 of favorable reserve development in the commercial multi-peril and other liability lines, respectively.\nExpense Ratio\nOur expense ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and operating expenses by the sum of net earned premiums and other income. We use the expense ratio to evaluate the operating efficiency of our consolidated operations and each segment. Costs that are not readily identifiable as a direct cost of a segment or product line remain in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes.\nThe table below provides the expense ratio by major component:\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>24.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>34.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>22.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>17.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>40.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy acquisition costs\n</td> <td>23.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>21.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>45.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur expense ratio remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014. The expense ratio remained consistent with the prior year as we saw an increase in our expenses, and our earned premium base has not yet grown sufficiently to show a reduction in the expense ratio.\nPolicy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets direct commissions with ceded commissions from reinsurers. The percentage of policy acquisition costs to net earned premiums and other income decreased slightly to 23.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 24.8% in 2014.\nOperating expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, information technology and occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. Operating expenses as a percent of net earned premiums and other income was 21.6% and 20.4% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 1.2 percentage point increase was due to the expansion of our underwriting operations, more specifically, the addition of our security guard team in late 2014 that began contributing premium at the beginning of 2015; the low-value dwelling team, located in the southwest United States, which was formed in early 2015 and began writing business in May 2015; and the hospitality team that joined the Company in the fourth quarter of 2015 and did not start binding policies until January 2016. For the year, expenses also increased as we added corporate staff to support the new underwriting teams and manage responsibilities associated with our recent status as a public company. The increase in the operating expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums and other income was also due to underwriting and administrative expenses related to our run-off personal automobile line (that had very little earned premium in 2015). The expenses related to the run-off business are expected to significantly decline in 2016.\nUnderwriting Results\nWe measure the performance of our consolidated results, in part, based on our underwriting gain or loss. The following table provides the underwriting gain or loss for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nUnderwriting Gain (Loss)\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Lines\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personal Lines\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,035\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,366\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>(6,439\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,133\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,306\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,439\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,228\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Percentage change is not meaningful\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Investment Income\nNet investment income increased by $727,000, or 61.9%, to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was the result of growth of the investment portfolio and a change in the mix of investments. Average invested assets as of December 31, 2015 were $111.5 million as compared to $81.2 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $30.3 million, or 37.3%. As of December 31, 2015, the average invested asset balance was comprised of 85.8% fixed maturities, 3.8% equity securities and 10.4% short-term investments, compared to the December 31, 2014 mix of 79.2% fixed maturities, 4.8% equity securities and 16.0% short term investments.\nThe portfolio's average quality was AA at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The portfolio produced a tax equivalent book yield of 2.1% and 1.9% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was 3.1 years at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $769,000 and $584,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest expense increased primarily due to the additional outstanding borrowings under the Revolver and 2014 Term Note. The outstanding borrowings under the Revolver were repaid from the proceeds received from the Company's IPO, in August 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had $0 of federal income tax expense due to a valuation allowance that offset any use of prior period net operating loss carryforwards and $48,000 of state income tax expense. The income tax benefit of $281,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 relates to the impact of changes to net unrealized gains during the year. This tax effect was included in the change in other comprehensive income and the corresponding change to the valuation allowance was reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a deferred tax benefit.\nThe Company has established a $5.2 million valuation allowance against 100% of the net deferred tax assets for 2015 and a $6.9 million valuation allowance for 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $17.4 million, which expire in tax years 2019 through 2035. Of this amount, $15.2 million are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $7.8 million, which expire in tax years 2029 through 2035.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Funds\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $23.3 million in cash and short-term investments. Our principal sources of funds, excluding capital raises, are insurance premiums, investment income, proceeds from maturity and sale of invested assets and installment fees. These funds are primarily used to pay claims, commissions, employee compensation, taxes and other operating expenses, and service debt.\nWe believe that our existing cash, short-term investments and investment securities balances and the $7.0 million available under our revolving credit line, will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity needs and the needs of our subsidiaries on a short-term and long-term basis.\nWe conduct our business operations primarily through our Insurance Company Subsidiaries. Our ability to service debt, and pay administrative expenses is primarily reliant upon our intercompany service fees paid by the Insurance Company Subsidiaries to the holding company for management, administrative, and information technology services provided to the Insurance Company Subsidiaries by the holding company. Secondarily, the holding company may receive dividends from the Insurance Company Subsidiaries; however, this is not the primary means in which the holding company supports its funding as state insurance laws restrict the ability of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries to declare dividends to the holding company under certain circumstances. Generally, the limitations are based on the greater of statutory net income for the preceding year or 10% of statutory surplus at the end of the preceding year. There were $5.5 million, $3.1 million and $500,000 of dividends paid from our Insurance Company Subsidiaries to the holding company during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe contributed $2.1 million to our Insurance Company Subsidiaries in 2016 to increase their statutory surplus levels. We believe that the current statutory surplus levels and the funds available at the holding company level will provide the necessary statutory capital to support our premium volume growth over the next two years.\nOn August 18, 2015, the Company completed its IPO in which it issued and sold 3,300,000 shares of common stock at an IPO of $10.50 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $30.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $2.4 million and other offering expenses of $1.8 million.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $6.2 million as compared to cash used in operating activities of $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash provided by operations was attributable to the overall growth of the business.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $3.1 million as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $6.3 million for December 31, 2014. $7.3 million of the change in cash from operating activities in 2015 from 2014 was primarily attributable to the change in the ceded unearned premium related to the quota share arrangement which was adopted December 31, 2014 and dissolved August 1, 2015.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $10.8 million as compared to $15.3 million for the same period in 2015. The fluctuation in the funds used in routine investing activities was due to the timing of standard purchases and sales to fund our insurance operations.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $15.3 million and was primarily attributable to net investments into fixed maturity securities of $23.9 million, offset by the sale of short term investments of $10.3 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $47.7 million and was primarily attributable to net investments into fixed maturity securities of $38.3 million and short term investments of $7.5 million.\nFinancing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $4.4 million as compared to $12.6 million for the same period in 2015. The higher cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was from the proceeds of the initial public offering, partially offset by the repayment of the line of credit.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we received net funds of $30.4 million from our IPO, received proceeds of $3.1 million for common stock issued to former holders of preferred stock. In addition, we used $6.3 million of the proceeds to repurchase outstanding shares of preferred stock and pay accrued preferred , used $17.0 million to pay off our revolving line of credit, received proceeds from our revolving line of credit of $4.4 million, and used $1.8 million for our routine payments on our term loans.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the $48.6 million of cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to $28.5 million of cash raised through the issuance of common stock, $6.1 million from the issuance of preferred stock and $14.5 million of additional net senior debt borrowings.\nOutstanding Debt\nWe are party to a $30.0 million senior credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\") with Comerica Bank which currently consists of the 2014 Term Note of $7.5 million, the Term Note of $5.0 million and the Revolver with an available $17.5 million. The Revolver was renewed on November 30, 2016 and the maturity date extended to August 1, 2018. Our total outstanding senior debt at December 31, 2016, was $17.8 million. Our minimum principal and interest payments on our senior debt for future years is $3.3 million for 2017, and $15.7 million for 2018-2019.\nThe Credit Facility contains various restrictive covenants that relate to the Company's shareholders' equity, premiums-to-capital and surplus ratios, fixed-charge coverage ratio, risk-based capital ratios, and A.M. Best ratings of its Insurance Company Subsidiaries. At December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of its Credit Facility covenants except for a minimum tangible net worth (as defined by the agreement) requirement to remain above $65.0 million. The Company's tangible net worth was $64.1 million at December 31, 2016. The Company received a waiver on March 13, 2017 for this covenant breach as of December 31, 2016, and the agreement was amended to reduce the minimum requirement to $62.0 million from March 31, 2017 to December 30, 2017 and $64.0 million from December 31, 2017 and thereafter, which management expects the Company will exceed in future periods.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than one year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One to three years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three to five years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than five years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolver\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Note\n</td> <td>1,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014 Term Note\n</td> <td>5,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Debt\n</td> <td>17,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Revolver\n</td> <td>870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Term Note\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on 2014 Term Note\n</td> <td>329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Interest Payable\n</td> <td>1,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td>5,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and loss adjustment expense (1)\n</td> <td>54,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations (2)\n</td> <td>1,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The estimated unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense payments were made using estimates based on historical payment patterns, however, future payments may be different than historical payment patterns.\n(2) Includes estimated future payments under the software license agreement relating to our policy issuance system. This agreement requires minimum monthly payments of $30,000, and is variable with premium volume. The future payment assumptions are based on the minimum monthly payments. The software license agreement expires on September 30, 2022.\nRegulatory and Rating Issues\nThe NAIC has a RBC formula to be applied to all property and casualty insurance companies. The formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company's products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital of regulated companies. The RBC formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action. In general, an insurance company must submit a calculation of its RBC formula to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year. These laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company's RBC declines.\nAt December 31, 2016, both of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries were in excess of any minimum threshold at which corrective action would be required.\nInsurance operations are subject to various leverage tests (e.g., premium-to-statutory surplus ratios), which are evaluated by regulators and rating agencies. As of December 31, 2016, on a trailing twelve-month statutory combined basis, the gross written and net written premium leverage ratios were 1.9 to 1.0 and 1.6 to 1.0, respectively.\nThe NAIC's Insurance Regulatory Information System ( IRIS\u201d) was developed to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values\u201d for each ratio. State insurance regulators review the IRIS ratio results to determine if an insurer is in need of further regulatory scrutiny or action. While the ratios, individually and collectively, are useful tools for identifying companies that may be experiencing financial difficulty, they are only a guide for regulators and should not be considered an absolute indicator of a Company's financial condition. While inquiries from regulators are not uncommon, our Insurance Company Subsidiaries have not experienced any regulatory actions due to their IRIS ratio results or otherwise.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 ~ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Guidance of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information.", "item_7_truncated": "Summary of Premium Revenue\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than one year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>One to three years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three to five years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than five years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolver\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Note\n</td> <td>1,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014 Term Note\n</td> <td>5,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Debt\n</td> <td>17,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Revolver\n</td> <td>870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Term Note\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on 2014 Term Note\n</td> <td>329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Interest Payable\n</td> <td>1,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td>5,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and loss adjustment expense (1)\n</td> <td>54,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations (2)\n</td> <td>1,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair values are measured in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. The guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value and a three-level hierarchy based upon the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: (1) Level 1: inputs are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (2) Level 2: inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability and (3) Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. The unobservable inputs represent the Company's best assumption of how market participants would price the assets or liabilities.\nThrough our personal insurance lines, we offer homeowners insurance and dwelling fire insurance products to individuals in several states. Our specialty homeowners insurance line is primarily comprised of either wind-exposed homeowners insurance providing hurricane and wind coverage to underserved homeowners in Texas, Hawaii and Florida or low-value dwelling insurance tailored for owners of lower valued homes, which we have historically offered in Illinois and Indiana, and have now expanded to Louisiana and Texas (where we have an office in Waco). Due to recent Florida-based industry events, we have been de-emphasizing our Florida homeowners' business and reducing our exposures in that state. Otherwise, there has been little change in our approach to managing or evaluating these lines.\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) allocable to common shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,437\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(476\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,200\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized investment gains and other gains (losses)\n</td> <td>1,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating (loss) allocable to common shareholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,549\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(865\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,617\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares, diluted\n</td> <td>7,618,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,369,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,672,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted (loss) per common share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) per share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.09\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.69\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized investment gains and other gains (losses) per share\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted operating (loss) per share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.85\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nIf, in the future, we determine we can support the recoverability of a portion or all of the deferred tax assets under the guidance, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense and result in an increase in equity.

Occasionally, several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of the loss. The level of IBNR reserves in relation to total reserves depends upon the characteristics of the specific line of business, particularly related to the speed with which claims are reported and outstanding claims are paid. Lines of business for which claims are reported slowly will have a higher percentage of IBNR reserves than lines of business that report and settle claims more quickly.\nWe use several generally accepted actuarial methods to develop estimated ultimate loss and LAE estimates by line of business and accident year. This process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends, is a reasonable basis for predicting future outcomes. These methods utilize various inputs, including but not limited to:\nGross written premiums increased $21.2 million, or 22.6%, to $114.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $93.8 million for the same period in 2015. The increase was driven by continued growth in our commercial lines. These results reflect our continued execution of our growth initiatives in the niche commercial insurance markets and our strategic change in the mix of business of our personal lines.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Ultimate\nLoss and LAE\nSensitivity\nFactor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\nUltimate\nLoss and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\nLoss and LAE\nReserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Potential\nImpact on\n2016 Pre-\nTax Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Potential\nImpact on 2016\nNet Income and\nDecember 31, 2016\nShareholders'\nEquity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increased Ultimate Losses & LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident Year 2016\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident Year 2015\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident Year 2014\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>712\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Prior Accident Years\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decreased Ultimate Losses & LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident Year 2016\n</td> <td>(10.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,836\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,192\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident Year 2015\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,150\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,419\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accident Year 2014\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,079\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(712\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Prior Accident Years\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThrough our commercial insurance lines, we offer coverage for both commercial property and commercial liability.

In addition, for fixed maturity securities, we also consider the credit quality ratings for the securities, with a special emphasis on securities downgraded to below investment grade. We also consider our intent to sell available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position, and if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before a recovery in fair value to their cost or amortized cost basis. For equity securities, we evaluate the near-term prospect of these investments in relation to the severity and duration of the impairment, and we consider our ability and intent to hold these investments until they recover their fair value.\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

considerable degree of judgment and expertise.

The premium decline was driven by the run-off of our personal automobile line in 2015, which saw a $7.3 million decline in premiums, year over year, for 2015. Partially offsetting the lower personal automobile premiums was a $4.1 million increase in premiums for our homeowners line of business. Homeowner premiums grew as a result of strategic underwriting and marketing changes to these lines implemented in late 2014. These changes favorably impacted our personal lines mix of business and drove a 40% increase in premiums in our more profitable wind-exposed business.\nInterest Expense\nTable 107: <table><tr><td>

primarily attributable to $28.5 million of cash raised through the issuance of common stock, $6.1 million from the issuance of preferred stock and $14.5 million of additional net senior debt borrowings.\nOperating expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, information technology and occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. Operating expenses as a percent of net earned premiums and other income was 21.6% and 20.4% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 1.2 percentage point increase was due to the expansion of our underwriting operations, more specifically, the addition of our security guard team in late 2014 that began contributing premium at the beginning of 2015; the low-value dwelling team, located in the southwest United States, which was formed in early 2015 and began writing business in May 2015; and the hospitality team that joined the Company in the fourth quarter of 2015 and did not start binding policies until January 2016. For the year, expenses also increased as we added corporate staff to support the new underwriting teams and manage responsibilities associated with our recent status as a public company. The increase in the operating expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums and other income was also due to underwriting and administrative expenses related to our run-off personal automobile line (that had very little earned premium in 2015). The expenses related to the run-off business are expected to significantly decline in 2016.\nOur premiums are presented below for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following table displays ultimate net loss and LAE and net loss and LAE reserves by accident year for the year ended December 31, 2016. We applied the sensitivity factors to each accident year amount and have calculated the amount of potential net loss and LAE reserve change and the impact on 2016 reported pre-tax income and on net income and shareholders' equity at December 31, 2016. We believe it is not appropriate to sum the illustrated amounts as it is not reasonably likely that each accident year's reserve estimate assumptions will vary simultaneously in the same direction to the full extent of the sensitivity factor. We also believe that such changes to our reserve balance would not have a material impact on our operating results, financial position, or liquidity. The net income and shareholders' equity amounts include an income tax rate assumption of 34%. The dollar amounts in the table are in thousands.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFinancing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $4.4 million as compared to $12.6 million for the same period in 2015. The higher cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was from the proceeds of the initial public offering, partially offset by the repayment of the line of credit.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAdjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Income Per Share\n\nWe review fair value prices provided by our outside investment managers for reasonableness by comparing the fair values provided by the managers to those provided by our investment custodian. We also review and monitor changes in unrealized gains and losses. We obtain an understanding of the methods, models and inputs used by our investment managers and independent pricing services, and controls are in place to validate that prices provided represent fair values. Our control process includes initial and ongoing evaluation of the methodologies used, a review of specific securities and an assessment for proper classification within the fair value hierarchy.\nWe evaluate our available-for-sale investments regularly to determine whether there have been declines in value that are other-than-temporary. Our outside investment managers assist us in this evaluation. When we determine that a security has experienced an other-than-temporary impairment, the impairment loss is recognized as a realized investment loss.\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nNet losses and LAE increased by $20.1 million, or 51.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a 34.2% increase in net earned premiums and $10.2 million of unfavorable reserve development from prior years. The calendar year loss ratios were 65.0% and 56.8% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 8.2 percentage point increase in our loss ratio was primarily attributable to the reserve strengthening in our Florida homeowners, commercial automobile and commercial liability lines of business.\nUnderwriting Gain (Loss)\nThe tables below detail our losses and LAE and loss ratios for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands).\nOn August 18, 2015, the Company completed its IPO in which it issued and sold 3,300,000 shares of common stock at an IPO of $10.50 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $30.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $2.4 million and other offering expenses of $1.8 million.\nOur premiums are presented below for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):\n\u2022 Our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim;\nTotal reserve development on prior accident years for the year ended December 31, 2015 was unfavorable by $1.5 million, or 2.1 percentage points of the loss ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2015, there was $1.2 million and $835,000 of unfavorable reserve development in the personal automobile and commercial automobile lines, respectively. This unfavorable development was partially offset by $320,000, $189,000, and $101,000 of favorable reserve development in the workers' compensation line, the low-value dwelling lines and the other liability line, respectively.\nWe measure the performance of our consolidated results, in part, based on our underwriting gain or loss. The following table provides the underwriting gain or loss for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):\nIBNR reserves are determined by subtracting case reserves from total estimated loss and LAE reserves, which are based on the ultimate expected losses and LAE less paid loss and LAE. Our actuarial department develops estimated ultimate loss and LAE on a quarterly basis. Our Reserve Review Committee (which includes our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, other members of executive management, and key actuarial, underwriting and claims personnel) meets each quarter to review our actuaries' estimated ultimate expected loss and LAE.\n\u2022 Expected claim reporting and payout patterns based on our own loss experience and supplemented with insurance industry data where applicable.\n\u2022 Policy provisions related to the claim;\nTotal reserve development on prior accident years for the year ended December 31, 2014 was favorable by $1.2 million, or 2.1 percentage points of the loss ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2014, there was $702,000 and $509,000 of favorable reserve development in the commercial multi-peril and other liability lines, respectively.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $10.8 million as compared to $15.3 million for the same period in 2015. The fluctuation in the funds used in routine investing activities was due to the timing of standard purchases and sales to fund our insurance operations.\nOur expense ratio remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014. The expense ratio remained consistent with the prior year as we saw an increase in our expenses, and our earned premium base has not yet grown sufficiently to show a reduction in the expense ratio.\nCommercial lines gross written premiums increased $20.0 million, or 29.4%, to $88.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily driven by expansion in the hospitality and security services product lines.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe portfolio's average quality was AA at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The portfolio produced a tax equivalent book yield of 2.2% and 2.1% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was 3.2 years and 3.1 years at December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nBusiness Overview\nPolicy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets direct commissions with ceded commissions from reinsurers. The percentage of policy acquisition costs to net earned premiums and other income decreased slightly to 23.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 24.8% in 2014.\n\n\nWe carry fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available-for-sale at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses on such securities, net of any deferred taxes, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not have any securities classified as trading or held-to-maturity.\n\nThe Company has established an $8.4 million valuation allowance against 100% of the net deferred tax assets for 2016, which would increase book value per share by $1.10 if reversed in the future, based on current income tax rates. The valuation allowance was $5.2 million for 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $22.8 million, which expire in tax years 2019 through 2036. Of this amount, $15.1 million are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $8.7 million, which expire in tax years 2030 through 2036.\nThe Credit Facility contains various restrictive covenants that relate to the Company's shareholders' equity, premiums-to-capital and surplus ratios, fixed-charge coverage ratio, risk-based capital ratios, and A.M. Best ratings of its Insurance Company Subsidiaries. At December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of its Credit Facility covenants except for a minimum tangible net worth (as defined by the agreement) requirement to remain above $65.0 million. The Company's tangible net worth was $64.1 million at December 31, 2016. The Company received a waiver on March 13, 2017 for this covenant breach as of December 31, 2016, and the agreement was amended to reduce the minimum requirement to $62.0 million from March 31, 2017 to December 30, 2017 and $64.0 million from December 31, 2017 and thereafter, which management expects the Company will exceed in future periods.\n\nUnderwriting Gain (Loss)\nWe are party to a $30.0 million senior credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\") with Comerica Bank which currently consists of the 2014 Term Note of $7.5 million, the Term Note of $5.0 million and the Revolver with an available $17.5 million. The Revolver was renewed on November 30, 2016 and the maturity date extended to August 1, 2018. Our total outstanding senior debt at December 31, 2016, was $17.8 million. Our minimum principal and interest payments on our senior debt for future years is $3.3 million for 2017, and $15.7 million for 2018-2019.\n\u2022 Actuarial projections of what we, at a given time, expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims reflecting facts and circumstances then known;\nOur loss and LAE reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability, but are estimates. The most significant assumptions affecting our IBNR reserve estimates are the loss development factors applied to paid losses and case reserves to develop IBNR by line of business and accident year. Although historical loss development provides us with an indication of future loss development, it typically varies from year to year. Thus, for each accident year within each line of business we select one loss development factor out of a range of historical factors.\nOur revenues are primarily derived from premiums earned from our insurance operations. We also generate other revenues through investment income and other income which mainly consists of: installment fees and policy issuance fees generally related to the policies we write and commission income from SIA's 50% owned agency (the \"Affiliate\"). The Affiliate places small commercial risks mainly for alarm and security guard markets.\nSummary Operating Results\nOverall reserve development on prior accident years for the year ended December 31, 2016 was unfavorable by $10.2 million, or 11.3 percentage points of the loss ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2016, this was made up of $2.7 million of adverse development in both the wind-exposed homeowners and commercial auto lines of business as well as $2.6 million and $760,000 of adverse development in the hospitality line of business and personal auto lines of business, respectively.\nOther income consists primarily of fees charged to policyholders by the Company for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billings or policy issuance costs. Commission income is also received by the Company's insurance agencies for writing policies for third party insurance companies. Other income for the year December 31, 2015 decreased $142,000, or 7.8%, to $1.7 million as compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe carried reserves reflect management's best estimate of the outstanding loss and LAE liabilities. Management arrives at this estimate after reviewing an internal analysis prepared by the Company's certified actuary.\nExecutive Overview\n\n\u2022 Case reserves, which are unpaid loss and LAE amounts we expect to pay for losses that have been reported; and\nOutstanding Debt\n\n\nInvestment Valuation and Impairment\nInterest expense was $769,000 and $584,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest expense increased primarily due to the additional outstanding borrowings under the Revolver and 2014 Term Note. The outstanding borrowings under the Revolver were repaid from the proceeds received from the Company's IPO, in August 2015.\nWe believe that our existing cash, short-term investments and investment securities balances and the $7.0 million available under our revolving credit line, will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity needs and the needs of our subsidiaries on a short-term and long-term basis.\nCertain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are not statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events or our future financial or operating performance. Words such as anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d may,\u201d plan,\u201d seek\u201d and similar terms and phrases, or the negative thereof, may be used to identify forward-looking statements.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe carrying value of our gross deferred tax asset for the NOL carryforwards is equal to the total NOL carryforward amount times the applicable federal and state tax rates, and was $8.0 million and $6.1 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total gross deferred tax assets were $13.0 million and $9.8 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. A valuation allowance of $8.4 million and $5.2 million has been recorded against the gross deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as the Company has recognized a three year cumulative loss as of December 31, 2016 which is significant negative evidence to support the lack of recoverability of those deferred tax assets in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. The net deferred tax liability was $179 thousand and $325 thousand as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOther Income\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income or loss.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d).\nOur results for the year ended December 31, 2016 also reflect the continued expansion of our commercial lines and repositioning of our personal lines. Our commercial lines gross written premiums grew by 29.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. Gross written premiums in our personal lines grew by 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.\n\u2022 Estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency;\nEarned premiums are earned ratably over the term of the policy, whereas written premiums are reflected on the effective date of the policy. All commercial lines and homeowners products have annual policies, under which premiums are earned evenly over one year. Almost all personal automobile policies are six month term policies under which premiums are earned evenly over a six-month period. The resulting net earned premiums are impacted by the gross and ceded written premiums, earned ratably over time.\nPremiums\n\u2022 The type of loss;\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $3.1 million as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $6.3 million for December 31, 2014. $7.3 million of the change in cash from operating activities in 2015 from 2014 was primarily attributable to the change in the ceded unearned premium related to the quota share arrangement which was adopted December 31, 2014 and dissolved August 1, 2015.\n\u2022 Expenses intended to cover the ultimate cost of settling claims, including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting from such claims, costs of outside adjusters and experts, and all other expenses which are identified to the case; and\nOther Income\nOur recorded loss and loss adjustment expenses (\"LAE\") reserves represent management's best estimate of unpaid loss and LAE at each balance sheet date, based on information, facts and circumstances known at such time. Our loss and LAE reserves reflect our estimates at the balance sheet date of the following items:\nThe principal standard actuarial methods used by our actuaries for their comprehensive reviews include:\nNet investment income increased by $271,000, or 14.2%, to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was the result of growth of the investment portfolio and a change in the mix of investments. Average invested assets as of December 31, 2016 were $123.1 million as compared to $111.5 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $11.6 million, or 10.4%. As of December 31, 2016, the average invested asset balance was comprised of 89.4% fixed maturities, 3.6% equity securities and 7.0% short-term investments, compared to the December 31, 2015 mix of 85.8% fixed maturities, 3.8% equity securities and 10.4% short term investments.\nThe calendar year loss ratios were 56.8% and 68.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 11.8 percentage point decrease in the loss ratio was mainly the result of lower losses in the low-value dwelling and commercial multi-peril lines. Both lines experienced losses that were historically higher in 2014 due to weather-related property damage. In addition, the mix of business continues to evolve as our lines of business with historically lower overall loss ratios grow (such as wind-exposed homeowners, and commercial liability lines), and the historically higher loss ratio businesses decline (such as low-value dwelling in the Midwest and nonstandard automobile).\nWe contributed $2.1 million to our Insurance Company Subsidiaries in 2016 to increase their statutory surplus levels. We believe that the current statutory surplus levels and the funds available at the holding company level will provide the necessary statutory capital to support our premium volume growth over the next two years.\nRegulatory and Rating Issues\nThe values for publicly-traded equity securities are generally based on Level 1 inputs which use the market approach valuation technique. The values for fixed maturity securities generally incorporate significant Level 2 inputs. The carrying value of cash and short-term investments approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturity.\nPolicy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets direct commissions with ceded commissions from reinsurers. The percentage of policy acquisition costs to net earned premiums and other income increased to 27.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 23.7% in 2015, primarily due to the termination of a quota share reinsurance agreement in August 2015, which had previously reduced commission expense from ceding commission received from the reinsurer. The Company's direct commission expense rate was consistent between 2015 and 2016.\n\u2022 Paid and reported losses and LAE;\n\u2022 Expected initial loss and LAE ratio, which is the ratio of incurred losses and LAE to earned premiums; and\nMost or all of these factors are not directly or precisely quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis, and are subject to a significant degree of variability over time. In addition, the establishment of loss and LAE reserves makes no provision for the broadening of coverage by legislative action or judicial interpretation or for the extraordinary future emergence of new types of losses not sufficiently represented in our historical experience or which cannot yet be quantified. As a result, an integral component of our loss and LAE reserving process is the use of informed subjective estimates and judgments about our ultimate exposure to losses and LAE. Accordingly, the ultimate liability may be more or less than the current estimate. The effects of change in the estimated loss and LAE reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimate is revised.\nExpense Ratio\nWe use adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share, in conjunction with other financial measures, to assess our performance and to evaluate the results of our business. We believe these measures provide investors with valuable information relating to our ongoing performance that may be obscured by the effect of investment gains and losses as a result of our market risk sensitive instruments, which primarily relate to fixed income securities that are available for sale and not held for trading purposes. Realized investment gains and losses may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by external economic developments, such as capital market conditions. Accordingly, adjusted operating income excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from our ongoing business operations and the underlying loss or profitability of our business. We believe that it is useful for investors to evaluate adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share, along with net income and net income per share, when reviewing and evaluating our performance.\nThe Company reported a net loss of $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $17,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net loss allocable to common shareholders was $8.4 million or $1.11 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $476,000 or $0.09 per share for the same period in 2015.\n\u2022 The severity of injury or damage;\nOur actuaries give different weights to each of these methods based upon the amount of historical experience data by line of business and by accident year, and based on judgment as to what method is believed to result in the most accurate estimate. The application of each method by line of business and by accident year may change in the future if it is determined that a different emphasis for each method would result in more accurate estimates.\nWe are an insurance holding company that markets and services our product offerings through specialty commercial and specialty personal insurance business lines. Our growth has been significant since our founding in 2009. Currently, we are authorized to write insurance as an excess and surplus lines carrier in 44 states, we are licensed to write insurance in 40 states as an admitted carrier and we offer our insurance products in all 50 states.\nOur expenses consist primarily of losses and loss adjustment expenses, agents' commissions, and other underwriting and administrative expenses. We organize our operations in two insurance businesses: commercial insurance lines and personal insurance lines.\n(1) The estimated unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense payments were made using estimates based on historical payment patterns, however, future payments may be different than historical payment patterns.\nThe increase was largely attributable to an 8.2 percentage point increase in the loss ratio in 2016, compared to 2015 attributable to higher than expected losses in Florida homeowners, commercial auto, commercial liability products and the personal auto run-off. Our expense ratio increased by 1.9 percentage points for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in the expense ratio was primarily due to increased policy acquisition costs as ceding commissions from a quota share agreement reduced commission expense in the first seven months of 2015. This increase was partially offset by improved operating expense ratios as we gained efficiencies from an improved earned premium base.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\n\nInvestment Income\n\u2022 Loss development methods-Loss development methods assume that the losses and LAE yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss and LAE amounts observed to-date. The paid loss development method uses losses and LAE paid to date, while the reported loss development method uses losses and LAE reported to date;\nEarned premiums are earned ratably over the term of the policy, whereas written premiums are reflected on the effective date of the policy. All commercial lines and homeowners products have annual policies, under which premiums are earned evenly over one year. Almost all personal automobile policies are six month term policies under which premiums are earned evenly over a six-month period. The resulting net earned premiums are impacted by the gross and ceded written premiums, earned ratably over time.\nInterest Expense\n* Percentage change is not meaningful\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nWe measure the performance of our consolidated results, in part, based on our underwriting gain or loss. The following table provides the underwriting gain or loss for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\n * Percentage change is not meaningful  Investment Income\nRefer to Note 1 ~ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Guidance of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information.\n\u2022 Frequency/severity method-This method projects claim counts and average cost per claim on a paid or reported basis for high frequency, low severity products.\nThe fair values of fixed maturity securities and equity securities have been determined using fair value prices provided by our investment managers, who utilize internationally recognized independent pricing services. The prices provided by the independent pricing services are generally based on observable market data in active markets (e.g., broker quotes and prices observed for comparable securities).\nThe NAIC's Insurance Regulatory Information System ( IRIS\u201d) was developed to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values\u201d for each ratio. State insurance regulators review the IRIS ratio results to determine if an insurer is in need of further regulatory scrutiny or action. While the ratios, individually and collectively, are useful tools for identifying companies that may be experiencing financial difficulty, they are only a guide for regulators and should not be considered an absolute indicator of a Company's financial condition. While inquiries from regulators are not uncommon, our Insurance Company Subsidiaries have not experienced any regulatory actions due to their IRIS ratio results or otherwise.\nThe following table is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\n* Percentage change is not meaningful\nForward-Looking Statements\nWe allocate the applicable portion of our estimated loss and LAE reserves to amounts recoverable from reinsurers under reinsurance contracts and report those amounts separately from our loss and LAE reserves as an asset on our balance sheet.\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $6.2 million as compared to cash used in operating activities of $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash provided by operations was attributable to the overall growth of the business.\nNet investment income increased by $727,000, or 61.9%, to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was the result of growth of the investment portfolio and a change in the mix of investments. Average invested assets as of December 31, 2015 were $111.5 million as compared to $81.2 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $30.3 million, or 37.3%. As of December 31, 2015, the average invested asset balance was comprised of 85.8% fixed maturities, 3.8% equity securities and 10.4% short-term investments, compared to the December 31, 2014 mix of 79.2% fixed maturities, 4.8% equity securities and 16.0% short term investments.\nWe identified the accounting estimates below as critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those estimates that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to exercise significant judgment. We use significant judgment concerning future results and developments in applying these critical accounting estimates and in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of material contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from the estimates and\nOther income consists primarily of fees charged to policyholders by the Company for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billings or policy issuance costs. Commission income is also received by the Company's insurance agencies for writing policies for third party insurance companies. Other income for the year December 31, 2016 decreased $549,000, or 32.9%, to $1.1 million as compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the deconsolidation of the Affiliate at September 30, 2015. Prior to the deconsolidation their income was recorded as other income, since then their net profit or loss has been recorded as equity earnings.\nThe portfolio's average quality was AA at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The portfolio produced a tax equivalent book yield of 2.1% and 1.9% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was 3.1 years at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nWe generated a sensitivity analysis of our net reserves which represents reasonably likely levels of variability in our selected loss development factors. We believe the most meaningful approach to the sensitivity analysis is to vary the loss development factors that drive the ultimate loss and LAE estimates. We applied this approach on an accident year basis, reflecting the reasonably likely differences in variability by level of maturity of the underlying loss experience for each accident year. Generally, the most recent accident years are characterized by more unreported losses and less information available for settling claims, and have more inherent uncertainty than the reserve estimates for more mature accident years. Therefore, we used variability factors of plus or minus 10% for the most recent accident year, 5% for the preceding accident year, and 2.5% for the second preceding accident year. There is minimal expected variability for accident years at four or more years' maturity.\nOur combined ratio increased 10.1 percentage points for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 112.2%, compared to 102.1% for the same period in 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $47.7 million and was primarily attributable to net investments into fixed maturity securities of $38.3 million and short term investments of $7.5 million.\nGeneral\nResults of Operations - 2015 Compared to 2014\n\nOverall reserve development on prior accident years for the year ended December 31, 2015 was unfavorable by $1.5 million, or 2.1 percentage points of the loss ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2015, there was $1.2 million and $835,000 of unfavorable reserve development in the personal automobile and commercial automobile lines, respectively. This unfavorable development was partially offset by $320,000, $189,000, and $101,000 of favorable reserve development in the workers' compensation line, the low-value dwelling lines and the other liability line, respectively.\nWe conduct our business operations primarily through our Insurance Company Subsidiaries. Our ability to service debt, and pay administrative expenses is primarily reliant upon our intercompany service fees paid by the Insurance Company Subsidiaries to the holding company for management, administrative, and information technology services provided to the Insurance Company Subsidiaries by the holding company. Secondarily, the holding company may receive dividends from the Insurance Company Subsidiaries; however, this is not the primary means in which the holding company supports its funding as state insurance laws restrict the ability of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries to declare dividends to the holding company under certain circumstances. Generally, the limitations are based on the greater of statutory net income for the preceding year or 10% of statutory surplus at the end of the preceding year. There were $5.5 million, $3.1 million and $500,000 of dividends paid from our Insurance Company Subsidiaries to the holding company during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nResults of Operations - 2016 Compared to 2015\nCash Flows\nassumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates regularly using information that we believe to be relevant. See the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further details.\n* Percentage change is not meaningful\nCommercial lines gross written premiums increased $13.1 million, or 23.9%, to $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $55.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily driven by the commercial multi-peril and other liability lines, which together grew by 22.1% year over year, largely due to expansion in the hospitality and security services product lines.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have federal and state income tax net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards of $22.8 million and $8.7 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates from 2019 through 2036. Of the federal NOL amount, $15.1 million are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. These net NOL carryforwards are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized. At this time we do not expect that any of the remaining NOL carryforwards will expire before utilized.\nAlthough we believe that our reserve estimates are reasonable, it is possible that our actual loss and LAE experience may not conform to our assumptions and may, in fact, vary significantly from our assumptions. Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses and the related LAE may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements. We continually review our estimates and adjust them as we believe appropriate as our experience develops or new information becomes known to us. Such adjustments are included in current operations.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on management's good-faith belief and reasonable judgment based on current information. The forward-looking statements are qualified by important factors, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including those described above in Item 1A Risk Factors and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date hereof or as of the date specified herein. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by any applicable laws or regulations.\n\n\u2022 Incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\") reserves, which are (1) unpaid loss and LAE amounts we expect to pay for losses that have been incurred but not yet reported; and (2) the expected development of losses and LAE on open reported cases.\nThe following table shows the ratio of IBNR reserves to total reserves net of reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\n\u2022 The jurisdiction of the occurrence;\nAdjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are non-GAAP measures that represent net income allocable to common shareholders excluding net realized investment and other gains (losses), net of tax, and the tax effect of changes in unrealized gains to the extent included in net income. The most directly comparable financial GAAP measures to adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are net income and net income per share, respectively. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are intended as supplemental information and are not meant to replace net income or net income per share. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. Our definition of adjusted operating income may be different from that used by other companies. The following is a reconciliation of net income to adjusted operating income (dollars in thousands), as well as net income per share to adjusted operating income per share:\n\u2022 Bornheutter-Ferguson method-This method is a combination of the loss ratio and loss development methods, where the loss development factor is given more weight as an accident year matures; and\nInterest expense was $647,000 and $769,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the decrease in outstanding borrowings in 2016 until the fourth quarter when the company drew $4.0 million on the Revolver. Prior to fourth quarter the borrowings were lower because the previously outstanding borrowings under the Revolver were repaid from the proceeds received from the Company's IPO, in August 2015.\nCase reserves for reported losses and LAE are initially set by our claims personnel. When a claim is reported to us, our claims department completes a case-basis valuation and establishes a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment as soon as practicable and after it has sufficient information to form a judgment about the probable ultimate losses and LAE associated with that claim, with a goal of setting the case reserve at the ultimate expected loss and LAE amount. Our claims department updates their case-basis valuations upon receipt of additional information. The case reserve is based primarily upon an evaluation of the following factors:\nAt December 31, 2016, both of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries were in excess of any minimum threshold at which corrective action would be required.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had $0 of federal income tax expense due to a valuation allowance that offset any use of prior period net operating loss carryforwards and $48,000 of state income tax expense. The income tax benefit of $281,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 relates to the impact of changes to net unrealized gains during the year. This tax effect was included in the change in other comprehensive income and the corresponding change to the valuation allowance was reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a deferred tax benefit.\nThe NAIC has a RBC formula to be applied to all property and casualty insurance companies. The formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company's products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital of regulated companies. The RBC formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action. In general, an insurance company must submit a calculation of its RBC formula to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year. These laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company's RBC declines.\nNet losses and LAE decreased by $1.8 million, or 4.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease in our net losses and LAE was attributable to a number of factors, including a significant reduction in weather-related property losses which were historically high in 2014, a decrease in losses in low-value dwelling resulting from our underwriting changes in late 2014, and an increase in ceded losses under the quota share reinsurance agreement. Partially offsetting these items were increases to net losses and LAE due to increases in the overall growth of our business as well as the strengthening of our commercial automobile reserves and losses in our run-off personal automobile line of business.\nOur expense ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and operating expenses by the sum of net earned premiums and other income. We use the expense ratio to evaluate the operating efficiency of our consolidated operations and each segment. Costs that are not readily identifiable as a direct cost of a segment or product line remain in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes.\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous state jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we received net funds of $30.4 million from our IPO, received proceeds of $3.1 million for common stock issued to former holders of preferred stock. In addition, we used $6.3 million of the proceeds to repurchase outstanding shares of preferred stock and pay accrued preferred, used $17.0 million to pay off our revolving line of credit, received proceeds from our revolving line of credit of $4.4 million, and used $1.8 million for our routine payments on our term loans.\nWe do not discount the loss and LAE reserves for the time value of money.\nNet written premiums increased $20.3 million, or 25.4%, to $99.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $79.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This result is consistent with the 22.6% increase in gross written premiums.\nAdjusted operating loss, a non-GAAP measure, allocable to common shareholders was $9.5 million or $1.26 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to an adjusted operating loss allocable to common shareholders of $865,000 or $0.16 per share for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\u2022 Analysis of other factors, such as variables in claims handling procedures, economic factors, and judicial and legislative trends and actions.\n\u2022 Written and earned premiums;\nOperating expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, information technology and occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. Operating expenses as a percent of net earned premiums and other income was 19.4% and 21.6% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Earned premium growth on a more fixed operating expense structure has helped to reduce the operating expense ratio, which is expected to continue to decline as our earned premium grows.\n\nOur actuaries also analyze several diagnostic measures by line of business and accident year, including but not limited to: reported and closed frequency and severity, claim reporting and claim closing patterns, paid and incurred loss ratio development, and ratios of paid loss and LAE to incurred loss and LAE. After the actuarial methods and diagnostic measures have been performed and analyzed, our actuaries use their judgment and expertise to select an estimated ultimate loss and LAE by line of business and by accident year.\nOur actuaries estimate an IBNR reserve for our unallocated LAE not specifically identified to a particular claim, namely our internal claims department salaries and associated general overhead and administrative expenses associated with the adjustment and processing of claims. These estimates, which are referred to as unallocated loss adjustment expense (\"ULAE\") reserves, are based on internal cost studies and analyses reflecting the relationship of ULAE paid to actual paid and incurred losses. We select factors that are applied to case reserves and IBNR reserve estimates in order to estimate the amount of ULAE reserves applicable to estimated loss reserves at the balance sheet date.\n(2) Includes estimated future payments under the software license agreement relating to our policy issuance system. This agreement requires minimum monthly payments of $30,000, and is variable with premium volume. The future payment assumptions are based on the minimum monthly payments. The software license agreement expires on September 30, 2022.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $15.3 million and was primarily attributable to net investments into fixed maturity securities of $23.9 million, offset by the sale of short term investments of $10.3 million.\nGross written premiums increased $9.9 million, or 11.8%, to $93.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $83.8 million for the same period in 2014. The increase was driven by continued growth in our commercial lines, offset by the run-off personal automobile line. These results reflect our continued execution of our growth initiatives in the niche commercial insurance markets and our strategic change in the mix of business of our personal lines.\nOur expense ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and operating expenses by the sum of net earned premiums and other income. We use the expense ratio to evaluate the operating efficiency of our consolidated operations and each segment. Costs that are not readily identifiable as a direct cost of a segment or product line remain in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes.\nPremiums\nUnderwriting Results\nNet written premiums increased $13.4 million, or 20.2%, to $79.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $66.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Of this increase, $7.3 million is due to the termination of a quota share reinsurance agreement which occurred on August 1, 2015. The quota share arrangement was terminated as management determined the Company no longer needed the leverage support of this reinsurance arrangement due to the added capital raised from the IPO. Excluding the impact of the quota share reinsurance agreement, the net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $6.1 million compared to the same period in 2014.\nExpense Ratio\n\nOur expense ratio increased by 1.9 percentage points for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in the ratio was primarily due to increased policy acquisition costs as ceding commissions from a quota share agreement reduced commission expense in the first seven months of 2015. This increase was partially offset by improved operating expense ratios as we gained efficiencies from an improved earned premium base.\n\u2022 Any other information considered pertinent to estimating the indemnity and expense exposure presented by the claim.\nInsurance operations are subject to various leverage tests (e.g., premium-to-statutory surplus ratios), which are evaluated by regulators and rating agencies. As of December 31, 2016, on a trailing twelve-month statutory combined basis, the gross written and net written premium leverage ratios were 1.9 to 1.0 and 1.6 to 1.0, respectively.", "item_7_text": "Summary of Premium Revenue\nFair values are measured in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. The guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value and a three-level hierarchy based upon the quality of inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: (1) Level 1: inputs are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, (2) Level 2: inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability and (3) Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. The unobservable inputs represent the Company's best assumption of how market participants would price the assets or liabilities.\nThrough our personal insurance lines, we offer homeowners insurance and dwelling fire insurance products to individuals in several states. Our specialty homeowners insurance line is primarily comprised of either wind-exposed homeowners insurance providing hurricane and wind coverage to underserved homeowners in Texas, Hawaii and Florida or low-value dwelling insurance tailored for owners of lower valued homes, which we have historically offered in Illinois and Indiana, and have now expanded to Louisiana and Texas (where we have an office in Waco). Due to recent Florida-based industry events, we have been de-emphasizing our Florida homeowners' business and reducing our exposures in that state. Otherwise, there has been little change in our approach to managing or evaluating these lines.\nIncome Taxes\nIf, in the future, we determine we can support the recoverability of a portion or all of the deferred tax assets under the guidance, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense and result in an increase in equity. Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future.\nSummary Operating Results\nOur reserves consist entirely of reserves for property and liability losses, consistent with the coverages provided for in the insurance policies directly written or assumed by us under reinsurance contracts. Occasionally, several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of the loss. The level of IBNR reserves in relation to total reserves depends upon the characteristics of the specific line of business, particularly related to the speed with which claims are reported and outstanding claims are paid. Lines of business for which claims are reported slowly will have a higher percentage of IBNR reserves than lines of business that report and settle claims more quickly.\nWe use several generally accepted actuarial methods to develop estimated ultimate loss and LAE estimates by line of business and accident year. This process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends, is a reasonable basis for predicting future outcomes. These methods utilize various inputs, including but not limited to:\nGross written premiums increased $21.2 million, or 22.6%, to $114.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $93.8 million for the same period in 2015. The increase was driven by continued growth in our commercial lines. These results reflect our continued execution of our growth initiatives in the niche commercial insurance markets and our strategic change in the mix of business of our personal lines.\nThrough our commercial insurance lines, we offer coverage for both commercial property and commercial liability. We also offer coverage for commercial automobiles and workers' compensation. Our insurance policies are sold to targeted small and mid-sized businesses on a single or multiple-coverage basis.\n\nPersonal lines gross written premiums increased $1.1 million, or 4.4%, to $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $25.6 million for the same period in 2015. This was largely driven by favorable growth of 38% in the Company's low-value dwelling product line, partially offset by reduction in gross written premiums in the Florida homeowners business as well as the personal automobile business which is in runoff.\nSummary of Premium Revenue \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe tables below detail our losses and LAE and loss ratios for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe table below provides the expense ratio by major component:\nThe Company has established a $5.2 million valuation allowance against 100% of the net deferred tax assets for 2015 and a $6.9 million valuation allowance for 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $17.4 million, which expire in tax years 2019 through 2035. Of this amount, $15.2 million are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $7.8 million, which expire in tax years 2029 through 2035.\n\u2022 Assessment of asserted theories of liability; and\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had $0 of current federal income tax expense due to current year losses, which can provide no benefit, and $70,000 of state income tax expense. The Company also had a deferred tax benefit of $147,000 related to a $400,000 write-off of intangible assets resulting from the merger of ACIC into WPIC in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had $0 of federal income tax expense and $48,000 of state income tax expense.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $23.3 million in cash and short-term investments. Our principal sources of funds, excluding capital raises, are insurance premiums, investment income, proceeds from maturity and sale of invested assets and installment fees. These funds are primarily used to pay claims, commissions, employee compensation, taxes and other operating expenses, and service debt.\nSources and Uses of Funds\nThe table below provides the expense ratio by major component:\nWe consider a number of factors in assessing whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, including (1) the amount and percentage that current fair value is below cost or amortized cost, (2) the length of time that the fair value has been below cost or amortized cost and (3) recent corporate developments or other factors that may impact an issuer's near term prospects. In addition, for fixed maturity securities, we also consider the credit quality ratings for the securities, with a special emphasis on securities downgraded to below investment grade. We also consider our intent to sell available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position, and if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before a recovery in fair value to their cost or amortized cost basis. For equity securities, we evaluate the near-term prospect of these investments in relation to the severity and duration of the impairment, and we consider our ability and intent to hold these investments until they recover their fair value.\nUnderwriting Results\n\nThe estimation of ultimate liability for losses and LAE is a complex, imprecise and inherently uncertain process, and therefore involves a considerable degree of judgment and expertise. Our loss and LAE reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability, but are estimates based upon various factors, including but not limited to:\nPersonal lines gross written premiums decreased $3.2 million, or 11.2%, to $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $28.8 million for the same period in 2014. The premium decline was driven by the run-off of our personal automobile line in 2015, which saw a $7.3 million decline in premiums, year over year, for 2015. Partially offsetting the lower personal automobile premiums was a $4.1 million increase in premiums for our homeowners line of business. Homeowner premiums grew as a result of strategic underwriting and marketing changes to these lines implemented in late 2014. These changes favorably impacted our personal lines mix of business and drove a 40% increase in premiums in our more profitable wind-exposed business.\nInterest Expense\n\u2022 Loss ratio method-This method uses loss and LAE ratios for prior accident years, adjusted for current trends, to determine an appropriate expected loss and LAE ratio for a given accident year;\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the $48.6 million of cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to $28.5 million of cash raised through the issuance of common stock, $6.1 million from the issuance of preferred stock and $14.5 million of additional net senior debt borrowings.\nOperating expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, information technology and occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. Operating expenses as a percent of net earned premiums and other income was 21.6% and 20.4% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 1.2 percentage point increase was due to the expansion of our underwriting operations, more specifically, the addition of our security guard team in late 2014 that began contributing premium at the beginning of 2015; the low-value dwelling team, located in the southwest United States, which was formed in early 2015 and began writing business in May 2015; and the hospitality team that joined the Company in the fourth quarter of 2015 and did not start binding policies until January 2016. For the year, expenses also increased as we added corporate staff to support the new underwriting teams and manage responsibilities associated with our recent status as a public company. The increase in the operating expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums and other income was also due to underwriting and administrative expenses related to our run-off personal automobile line (that had very little earned premium in 2015). The expenses related to the run-off business are expected to significantly decline in 2016.\nOur premiums are presented below for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following table displays ultimate net loss and LAE and net loss and LAE reserves by accident year for the year ended December 31, 2016. We applied the sensitivity factors to each accident year amount and have calculated the amount of potential net loss and LAE reserve change and the impact on 2016 reported pre-tax income and on net income and shareholders' equity at December 31, 2016. We believe it is not appropriate to sum the illustrated amounts as it is not reasonably likely that each accident year's reserve estimate assumptions will vary simultaneously in the same direction to the full extent of the sensitivity factor. We also believe that such changes to our reserve balance would not have a material impact on our operating results, financial position, or liquidity. The net income and shareholders' equity amounts include an income tax rate assumption of 34%. The dollar amounts in the table are in thousands.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFinancing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $4.4 million as compared to $12.6 million for the same period in 2015. The higher cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was from the proceeds of the initial public offering, partially offset by the repayment of the line of credit.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAdjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Income Per Share\n\nWe review fair value prices provided by our outside investment managers for reasonableness by comparing the fair values provided by the managers to those provided by our investment custodian. We also review and monitor changes in unrealized gains and losses. We obtain an understanding of the methods, models and inputs used by our investment managers and independent pricing services, and controls are in place to validate that prices provided represent fair values. Our control process includes initial and ongoing evaluation of the methodologies used, a review of specific securities and an assessment for proper classification within the fair value hierarchy.\nWe evaluate our available-for-sale investments regularly to determine whether there have been declines in value that are other-than-temporary. Our outside investment managers assist us in this evaluation. When we determine that a security has experienced an other-than-temporary impairment, the impairment loss is recognized as a realized investment loss.\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nNet losses and LAE increased by $20.1 million, or 51.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a 34.2% increase in net earned premiums and $10.2 million of unfavorable reserve development from prior years. The calendar year loss ratios were 65.0% and 56.8% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 8.2 percentage point increase in our loss ratio was primarily attributable to the reserve strengthening in our Florida homeowners, commercial automobile and commercial liability lines of business.\nUnderwriting Gain (Loss)\nThe tables below detail our losses and LAE and loss ratios for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands).\nOn August 18, 2015, the Company completed its IPO in which it issued and sold 3,300,000 shares of common stock at an IPO of $10.50 per share. The Company received net proceeds of $30.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $2.4 million and other offering expenses of $1.8 million.\nOur premiums are presented below for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):\n\u2022 Our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim;\nTotal reserve development on prior accident years for the year ended December 31, 2015 was unfavorable by $1.5 million, or 2.1 percentage points of the loss ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2015, there was $1.2 million and $835,000 of unfavorable reserve development in the personal automobile and commercial automobile lines, respectively. This unfavorable development was partially offset by $320,000, $189,000, and $101,000 of favorable reserve development in the workers' compensation line, the low-value dwelling lines and the other liability line, respectively.\nWe measure the performance of our consolidated results, in part, based on our underwriting gain or loss. The following table provides the underwriting gain or loss for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):\nIBNR reserves are determined by subtracting case reserves from total estimated loss and LAE reserves, which are based on the ultimate expected losses and LAE less paid loss and LAE. Our actuarial department develops estimated ultimate loss and LAE on a quarterly basis. Our Reserve Review Committee (which includes our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, other members of executive management, and key actuarial, underwriting and claims personnel) meets each quarter to review our actuaries' estimated ultimate expected loss and LAE.\n\u2022 Expected claim reporting and payout patterns based on our own loss experience and supplemented with insurance industry data where applicable.\n\u2022 Policy provisions related to the claim;\nTotal reserve development on prior accident years for the year ended December 31, 2014 was favorable by $1.2 million, or 2.1 percentage points of the loss ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2014, there was $702,000 and $509,000 of favorable reserve development in the commercial multi-peril and other liability lines, respectively.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $10.8 million as compared to $15.3 million for the same period in 2015. The fluctuation in the funds used in routine investing activities was due to the timing of standard purchases and sales to fund our insurance operations.\nOur expense ratio remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014. The expense ratio remained consistent with the prior year as we saw an increase in our expenses, and our earned premium base has not yet grown sufficiently to show a reduction in the expense ratio.\nCommercial lines gross written premiums increased $20.0 million, or 29.4%, to $88.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily driven by expansion in the hospitality and security services product lines.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe portfolio's average quality was AA at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The portfolio produced a tax equivalent book yield of 2.2% and 2.1% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was 3.2 years and 3.1 years at December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nBusiness Overview\nPolicy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets direct commissions with ceded commissions from reinsurers. The percentage of policy acquisition costs to net earned premiums and other income decreased slightly to 23.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 24.8% in 2014.\n\n\nWe carry fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available-for-sale at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses on such securities, net of any deferred taxes, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not have any securities classified as trading or held-to-maturity.\n\nThe Company has established an $8.4 million valuation allowance against 100% of the net deferred tax assets for 2016, which would increase book value per share by $1.10 if reversed in the future, based on current income tax rates. The valuation allowance was $5.2 million for 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $22.8 million, which expire in tax years 2019 through 2036. Of this amount, $15.1 million are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $8.7 million, which expire in tax years 2030 through 2036.\nThe Credit Facility contains various restrictive covenants that relate to the Company's shareholders' equity, premiums-to-capital and surplus ratios, fixed-charge coverage ratio, risk-based capital ratios, and A.M. Best ratings of its Insurance Company Subsidiaries. At December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of its Credit Facility covenants except for a minimum tangible net worth (as defined by the agreement) requirement to remain above $65.0 million. The Company's tangible net worth was $64.1 million at December 31, 2016. The Company received a waiver on March 13, 2017 for this covenant breach as of December 31, 2016, and the agreement was amended to reduce the minimum requirement to $62.0 million from March 31, 2017 to December 30, 2017 and $64.0 million from December 31, 2017 and thereafter, which management expects the Company will exceed in future periods.\n\nUnderwriting Gain (Loss)\nWe are party to a $30.0 million senior credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\") with Comerica Bank which currently consists of the 2014 Term Note of $7.5 million, the Term Note of $5.0 million and the Revolver with an available $17.5 million. The Revolver was renewed on November 30, 2016 and the maturity date extended to August 1, 2018. Our total outstanding senior debt at December 31, 2016, was $17.8 million. Our minimum principal and interest payments on our senior debt for future years is $3.3 million for 2017, and $15.7 million for 2018-2019.\n\u2022 Actuarial projections of what we, at a given time, expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims reflecting facts and circumstances then known;\nOur loss and LAE reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability, but are estimates. The most significant assumptions affecting our IBNR reserve estimates are the loss development factors applied to paid losses and case reserves to develop IBNR by line of business and accident year. Although historical loss development provides us with an indication of future loss development, it typically varies from year to year. Thus, for each accident year within each line of business we select one loss development factor out of a range of historical factors.\nOur revenues are primarily derived from premiums earned from our insurance operations. We also generate other revenues through investment income and other income which mainly consists of: installment fees and policy issuance fees generally related to the policies we write and commission income from SIA's 50% owned agency (the \"Affiliate\"). The Affiliate places small commercial risks mainly for alarm and security guard markets.\nSummary Operating Results\nOverall reserve development on prior accident years for the year ended December 31, 2016 was unfavorable by $10.2 million, or 11.3 percentage points of the loss ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2016, this was made up of $2.7 million of adverse development in both the wind-exposed homeowners and commercial auto lines of business as well as $2.6 million and $760,000 of adverse development in the hospitality line of business and personal auto lines of business, respectively.\nOther income consists primarily of fees charged to policyholders by the Company for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billings or policy issuance costs. Commission income is also received by the Company's insurance agencies for writing policies for third party insurance companies. Other income for the year December 31, 2015 decreased $142,000, or 7.8%, to $1.7 million as compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe carried reserves reflect management's best estimate of the outstanding loss and LAE liabilities. Management arrives at this estimate after reviewing an internal analysis prepared by the Company's certified actuary.\nExecutive Overview\n\n\u2022 Case reserves, which are unpaid loss and LAE amounts we expect to pay for losses that have been reported; and\nOutstanding Debt\n\n\nInvestment Valuation and Impairment\nInterest expense was $769,000 and $584,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest expense increased primarily due to the additional outstanding borrowings under the Revolver and 2014 Term Note. The outstanding borrowings under the Revolver were repaid from the proceeds received from the Company's IPO, in August 2015.\nWe believe that our existing cash, short-term investments and investment securities balances and the $7.0 million available under our revolving credit line, will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity needs and the needs of our subsidiaries on a short-term and long-term basis.\nCertain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are not statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events or our future financial or operating performance. Words such as anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d may,\u201d plan,\u201d seek\u201d and similar terms and phrases, or the negative thereof, may be used to identify forward-looking statements.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe carrying value of our gross deferred tax asset for the NOL carryforwards is equal to the total NOL carryforward amount times the applicable federal and state tax rates, and was $8.0 million and $6.1 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total gross deferred tax assets were $13.0 million and $9.8 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. A valuation allowance of $8.4 million and $5.2 million has been recorded against the gross deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as the Company has recognized a three year cumulative loss as of December 31, 2016 which is significant negative evidence to support the lack of recoverability of those deferred tax assets in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. The net deferred tax liability was $179 thousand and $325 thousand as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOther Income\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income or loss.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d).\nOur results for the year ended December 31, 2016 also reflect the continued expansion of our commercial lines and repositioning of our personal lines. Our commercial lines gross written premiums grew by 29.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. Gross written premiums in our personal lines grew by 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.\n\u2022 Estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency;\nEarned premiums are earned ratably over the term of the policy, whereas written premiums are reflected on the effective date of the policy. All commercial lines and homeowners products have annual policies, under which premiums are earned evenly over one year. Almost all personal automobile policies are six month term policies under which premiums are earned evenly over a six-month period. The resulting net earned premiums are impacted by the gross and ceded written premiums, earned ratably over time.\nPremiums\n\u2022 The type of loss;\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $3.1 million as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $6.3 million for December 31, 2014. $7.3 million of the change in cash from operating activities in 2015 from 2014 was primarily attributable to the change in the ceded unearned premium related to the quota share arrangement which was adopted December 31, 2014 and dissolved August 1, 2015.\n\u2022 Expenses intended to cover the ultimate cost of settling claims, including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting from such claims, costs of outside adjusters and experts, and all other expenses which are identified to the case; and\nOther Income\nOur recorded loss and loss adjustment expenses (\"LAE\") reserves represent management's best estimate of unpaid loss and LAE at each balance sheet date, based on information, facts and circumstances known at such time. Our loss and LAE reserves reflect our estimates at the balance sheet date of the following items:\nThe principal standard actuarial methods used by our actuaries for their comprehensive reviews include:\nNet investment income increased by $271,000, or 14.2%, to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was the result of growth of the investment portfolio and a change in the mix of investments. Average invested assets as of December 31, 2016 were $123.1 million as compared to $111.5 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $11.6 million, or 10.4%. As of December 31, 2016, the average invested asset balance was comprised of 89.4% fixed maturities, 3.6% equity securities and 7.0% short-term investments, compared to the December 31, 2015 mix of 85.8% fixed maturities, 3.8% equity securities and 10.4% short term investments.\nThe calendar year loss ratios were 56.8% and 68.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 11.8 percentage point decrease in the loss ratio was mainly the result of lower losses in the low-value dwelling and commercial multi-peril lines. Both lines experienced losses that were historically higher in 2014 due to weather-related property damage. In addition, the mix of business continues to evolve as our lines of business with historically lower overall loss ratios grow (such as wind-exposed homeowners, and commercial liability lines), and the historically higher loss ratio businesses decline (such as low-value dwelling in the Midwest and nonstandard automobile).\nWe contributed $2.1 million to our Insurance Company Subsidiaries in 2016 to increase their statutory surplus levels. We believe that the current statutory surplus levels and the funds available at the holding company level will provide the necessary statutory capital to support our premium volume growth over the next two years.\nRegulatory and Rating Issues\nThe values for publicly-traded equity securities are generally based on Level 1 inputs which use the market approach valuation technique. The values for fixed maturity securities generally incorporate significant Level 2 inputs. The carrying value of cash and short-term investments approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturity.\nPolicy acquisition costs are costs we incur to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets direct commissions with ceded commissions from reinsurers. The percentage of policy acquisition costs to net earned premiums and other income increased to 27.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 23.7% in 2015, primarily due to the termination of a quota share reinsurance agreement in August 2015, which had previously reduced commission expense from ceding commission received from the reinsurer. The Company's direct commission expense rate was consistent between 2015 and 2016.\n\u2022 Paid and reported losses and LAE;\n\u2022 Expected initial loss and LAE ratio, which is the ratio of incurred losses and LAE to earned premiums; and\nMost or all of these factors are not directly or precisely quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis, and are subject to a significant degree of variability over time. In addition, the establishment of loss and LAE reserves makes no provision for the broadening of coverage by legislative action or judicial interpretation or for the extraordinary future emergence of new types of losses not sufficiently represented in our historical experience or which cannot yet be quantified. As a result, an integral component of our loss and LAE reserving process is the use of informed subjective estimates and judgments about our ultimate exposure to losses and LAE. Accordingly, the ultimate liability may be more or less than the current estimate. The effects of change in the estimated loss and LAE reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimate is revised.\nExpense Ratio\nWe use adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share, in conjunction with other financial measures, to assess our performance and to evaluate the results of our business. We believe these measures provide investors with valuable information relating to our ongoing performance that may be obscured by the effect of investment gains and losses as a result of our market risk sensitive instruments, which primarily relate to fixed income securities that are available for sale and not held for trading purposes. Realized investment gains and losses may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by external economic developments, such as capital market conditions. Accordingly, adjusted operating income excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from our ongoing business operations and the underlying loss or profitability of our business. We believe that it is useful for investors to evaluate adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share, along with net income and net income per share, when reviewing and evaluating our performance.\nThe Company reported a net loss of $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $17,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net loss allocable to common shareholders was $8.4 million or $1.11 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $476,000 or $0.09 per share for the same period in 2015.\n\u2022 The severity of injury or damage;\nOur actuaries give different weights to each of these methods based upon the amount of historical experience data by line of business and by accident year, and based on judgment as to what method is believed to result in the most accurate estimate. The application of each method by line of business and by accident year may change in the future if it is determined that a different emphasis for each method would result in more accurate estimates.\nWe are an insurance holding company that markets and services our product offerings through specialty commercial and specialty personal insurance business lines. Our growth has been significant since our founding in 2009. Currently, we are authorized to write insurance as an excess and surplus lines carrier in 44 states, we are licensed to write insurance in 40 states as an admitted carrier and we offer our insurance products in all 50 states.\nOur expenses consist primarily of losses and loss adjustment expenses, agents' commissions, and other underwriting and administrative expenses. We organize our operations in two insurance businesses: commercial insurance lines and personal insurance lines.\n(1) The estimated unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense payments were made using estimates based on historical payment patterns, however, future payments may be different than historical payment patterns.\nThe increase was largely attributable to an 8.2 percentage point increase in the loss ratio in 2016, compared to 2015 attributable to higher than expected losses in Florida homeowners, commercial auto, commercial liability products and the personal auto run-off. Our expense ratio increased by 1.9 percentage points for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in the expense ratio was primarily due to increased policy acquisition costs as ceding commissions from a quota share agreement reduced commission expense in the first seven months of 2015. This increase was partially offset by improved operating expense ratios as we gained efficiencies from an improved earned premium base.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\n\nInvestment Income\n\u2022 Loss development methods-Loss development methods assume that the losses and LAE yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss and LAE amounts observed to-date. The paid loss development method uses losses and LAE paid to date, while the reported loss development method uses losses and LAE reported to date;\nEarned premiums are earned ratably over the term of the policy, whereas written premiums are reflected on the effective date of the policy. All commercial lines and homeowners products have annual policies, under which premiums are earned evenly over one year. Almost all personal automobile policies are six month term policies under which premiums are earned evenly over a six-month period. The resulting net earned premiums are impacted by the gross and ceded written premiums, earned ratably over time.\nInterest Expense\n* Percentage change is not meaningful\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nWe measure the performance of our consolidated results, in part, based on our underwriting gain or loss. The following table provides the underwriting gain or loss for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\n * Percentage change is not meaningful  Investment Income\nRefer to Note 1 ~ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Guidance of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information.\n\u2022 Frequency/severity method-This method projects claim counts and average cost per claim on a paid or reported basis for high frequency, low severity products.\nThe fair values of fixed maturity securities and equity securities have been determined using fair value prices provided by our investment managers, who utilize internationally recognized independent pricing services. The prices provided by the independent pricing services are generally based on observable market data in active markets (e.g., broker quotes and prices observed for comparable securities).\nThe NAIC's Insurance Regulatory Information System ( IRIS\u201d) was developed to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values\u201d for each ratio. State insurance regulators review the IRIS ratio results to determine if an insurer is in need of further regulatory scrutiny or action. While the ratios, individually and collectively, are useful tools for identifying companies that may be experiencing financial difficulty, they are only a guide for regulators and should not be considered an absolute indicator of a Company's financial condition. While inquiries from regulators are not uncommon, our Insurance Company Subsidiaries have not experienced any regulatory actions due to their IRIS ratio results or otherwise.\nThe following table is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\n* Percentage change is not meaningful\nForward-Looking Statements\nWe allocate the applicable portion of our estimated loss and LAE reserves to amounts recoverable from reinsurers under reinsurance contracts and report those amounts separately from our loss and LAE reserves as an asset on our balance sheet.\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $6.2 million as compared to cash used in operating activities of $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash provided by operations was attributable to the overall growth of the business.\nNet investment income increased by $727,000, or 61.9%, to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was the result of growth of the investment portfolio and a change in the mix of investments. Average invested assets as of December 31, 2015 were $111.5 million as compared to $81.2 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $30.3 million, or 37.3%. As of December 31, 2015, the average invested asset balance was comprised of 85.8% fixed maturities, 3.8% equity securities and 10.4% short-term investments, compared to the December 31, 2014 mix of 79.2% fixed maturities, 4.8% equity securities and 16.0% short term investments.\nWe identified the accounting estimates below as critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those estimates that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to exercise significant judgment. We use significant judgment concerning future results and developments in applying these critical accounting estimates and in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of material contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from the estimates and\nOther income consists primarily of fees charged to policyholders by the Company for services outside of the premium charge, such as installment billings or policy issuance costs. Commission income is also received by the Company's insurance agencies for writing policies for third party insurance companies. Other income for the year December 31, 2016 decreased $549,000, or 32.9%, to $1.1 million as compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the deconsolidation of the Affiliate at September 30, 2015. Prior to the deconsolidation their income was recorded as other income, since then their net profit or loss has been recorded as equity earnings.\nThe portfolio's average quality was AA at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The portfolio produced a tax equivalent book yield of 2.1% and 1.9% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was 3.1 years at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nWe generated a sensitivity analysis of our net reserves which represents reasonably likely levels of variability in our selected loss development factors. We believe the most meaningful approach to the sensitivity analysis is to vary the loss development factors that drive the ultimate loss and LAE estimates. We applied this approach on an accident year basis, reflecting the reasonably likely differences in variability by level of maturity of the underlying loss experience for each accident year. Generally, the most recent accident years are characterized by more unreported losses and less information available for settling claims, and have more inherent uncertainty than the reserve estimates for more mature accident years. Therefore, we used variability factors of plus or minus 10% for the most recent accident year, 5% for the preceding accident year, and 2.5% for the second preceding accident year. There is minimal expected variability for accident years at four or more years' maturity.\nOur combined ratio increased 10.1 percentage points for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 112.2%, compared to 102.1% for the same period in 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $47.7 million and was primarily attributable to net investments into fixed maturity securities of $38.3 million and short term investments of $7.5 million.\nGeneral\nResults of Operations - 2015 Compared to 2014\n\nOverall reserve development on prior accident years for the year ended December 31, 2015 was unfavorable by $1.5 million, or 2.1 percentage points of the loss ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2015, there was $1.2 million and $835,000 of unfavorable reserve development in the personal automobile and commercial automobile lines, respectively. This unfavorable development was partially offset by $320,000, $189,000, and $101,000 of favorable reserve development in the workers' compensation line, the low-value dwelling lines and the other liability line, respectively.\nWe conduct our business operations primarily through our Insurance Company Subsidiaries. Our ability to service debt, and pay administrative expenses is primarily reliant upon our intercompany service fees paid by the Insurance Company Subsidiaries to the holding company for management, administrative, and information technology services provided to the Insurance Company Subsidiaries by the holding company. Secondarily, the holding company may receive dividends from the Insurance Company Subsidiaries; however, this is not the primary means in which the holding company supports its funding as state insurance laws restrict the ability of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries to declare dividends to the holding company under certain circumstances. Generally, the limitations are based on the greater of statutory net income for the preceding year or 10% of statutory surplus at the end of the preceding year. There were $5.5 million, $3.1 million and $500,000 of dividends paid from our Insurance Company Subsidiaries to the holding company during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nResults of Operations - 2016 Compared to 2015\nCash Flows\nassumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates regularly using information that we believe to be relevant. See the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further details.\n* Percentage change is not meaningful\nCommercial lines gross written premiums increased $13.1 million, or 23.9%, to $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $55.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily driven by the commercial multi-peril and other liability lines, which together grew by 22.1% year over year, largely due to expansion in the hospitality and security services product lines.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have federal and state income tax net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards of $22.8 million and $8.7 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates from 2019 through 2036. Of the federal NOL amount, $15.1 million are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. These net NOL carryforwards are limited in the amount that can be utilized in any one year and may expire before they are realized. At this time we do not expect that any of the remaining NOL carryforwards will expire before utilized.\nAlthough we believe that our reserve estimates are reasonable, it is possible that our actual loss and LAE experience may not conform to our assumptions and may, in fact, vary significantly from our assumptions. Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses and the related LAE may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements. We continually review our estimates and adjust them as we believe appropriate as our experience develops or new information becomes known to us. Such adjustments are included in current operations.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on management's good-faith belief and reasonable judgment based on current information. The forward-looking statements are qualified by important factors, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including those described above in Item 1A Risk Factors and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date hereof or as of the date specified herein. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by any applicable laws or regulations.\n\n\u2022 Incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\") reserves, which are (1) unpaid loss and LAE amounts we expect to pay for losses that have been incurred but not yet reported; and (2) the expected development of losses and LAE on open reported cases.\nThe following table shows the ratio of IBNR reserves to total reserves net of reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\n\u2022 The jurisdiction of the occurrence;\nAdjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are non-GAAP measures that represent net income allocable to common shareholders excluding net realized investment and other gains (losses), net of tax, and the tax effect of changes in unrealized gains to the extent included in net income. The most directly comparable financial GAAP measures to adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are net income and net income per share, respectively. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share are intended as supplemental information and are not meant to replace net income or net income per share. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income per share should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. Our definition of adjusted operating income may be different from that used by other companies. The following is a reconciliation of net income to adjusted operating income (dollars in thousands), as well as net income per share to adjusted operating income per share:\n\u2022 Bornheutter-Ferguson method-This method is a combination of the loss ratio and loss development methods, where the loss development factor is given more weight as an accident year matures; and\nInterest expense was $647,000 and $769,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the decrease in outstanding borrowings in 2016 until the fourth quarter when the company drew $4.0 million on the Revolver. Prior to fourth quarter the borrowings were lower because the previously outstanding borrowings under the Revolver were repaid from the proceeds received from the Company's IPO, in August 2015.\nCase reserves for reported losses and LAE are initially set by our claims personnel. When a claim is reported to us, our claims department completes a case-basis valuation and establishes a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment as soon as practicable and after it has sufficient information to form a judgment about the probable ultimate losses and LAE associated with that claim, with a goal of setting the case reserve at the ultimate expected loss and LAE amount. Our claims department updates their case-basis valuations upon receipt of additional information. The case reserve is based primarily upon an evaluation of the following factors:\nAt December 31, 2016, both of our Insurance Company Subsidiaries were in excess of any minimum threshold at which corrective action would be required.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had $0 of federal income tax expense due to a valuation allowance that offset any use of prior period net operating loss carryforwards and $48,000 of state income tax expense. The income tax benefit of $281,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 relates to the impact of changes to net unrealized gains during the year. This tax effect was included in the change in other comprehensive income and the corresponding change to the valuation allowance was reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a deferred tax benefit.\nThe NAIC has a RBC formula to be applied to all property and casualty insurance companies. The formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company's products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital of regulated companies. The RBC formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action. In general, an insurance company must submit a calculation of its RBC formula to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year. These laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company's RBC declines.\nNet losses and LAE decreased by $1.8 million, or 4.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease in our net losses and LAE was attributable to a number of factors, including a significant reduction in weather-related property losses which were historically high in 2014, a decrease in losses in low-value dwelling resulting from our underwriting changes in late 2014, and an increase in ceded losses under the quota share reinsurance agreement. Partially offsetting these items were increases to net losses and LAE due to increases in the overall growth of our business as well as the strengthening of our commercial automobile reserves and losses in our run-off personal automobile line of business.\nOur expense ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and operating expenses by the sum of net earned premiums and other income. We use the expense ratio to evaluate the operating efficiency of our consolidated operations and each segment. Costs that are not readily identifiable as a direct cost of a segment or product line remain in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes.\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous state jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we received net funds of $30.4 million from our IPO, received proceeds of $3.1 million for common stock issued to former holders of preferred stock. In addition, we used $6.3 million of the proceeds to repurchase outstanding shares of preferred stock and pay accrued preferred, used $17.0 million to pay off our revolving line of credit, received proceeds from our revolving line of credit of $4.4 million, and used $1.8 million for our routine payments on our term loans.\nWe do not discount the loss and LAE reserves for the time value of money.\nNet written premiums increased $20.3 million, or 25.4%, to $99.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $79.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This result is consistent with the 22.6% increase in gross written premiums.\nAdjusted operating loss, a non-GAAP measure, allocable to common shareholders was $9.5 million or $1.26 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to an adjusted operating loss allocable to common shareholders of $865,000 or $0.16 per share for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\u2022 Analysis of other factors, such as variables in claims handling procedures, economic factors, and judicial and legislative trends and actions.\n\u2022 Written and earned premiums;\nOperating expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, information technology and occupancy costs, such as rent and utilities. Operating expenses as a percent of net earned premiums and other income was 19.4% and 21.6% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Earned premium growth on a more fixed operating expense structure has helped to reduce the operating expense ratio, which is expected to continue to decline as our earned premium grows.\n\nOur actuaries also analyze several diagnostic measures by line of business and accident year, including but not limited to: reported and closed frequency and severity, claim reporting and claim closing patterns, paid and incurred loss ratio development, and ratios of paid loss and LAE to incurred loss and LAE. After the actuarial methods and diagnostic measures have been performed and analyzed, our actuaries use their judgment and expertise to select an estimated ultimate loss and LAE by line of business and by accident year.\nOur actuaries estimate an IBNR reserve for our unallocated LAE not specifically identified to a particular claim, namely our internal claims department salaries and associated general overhead and administrative expenses associated with the adjustment and processing of claims. These estimates, which are referred to as unallocated loss adjustment expense (\"ULAE\") reserves, are based on internal cost studies and analyses reflecting the relationship of ULAE paid to actual paid and incurred losses. We select factors that are applied to case reserves and IBNR reserve estimates in order to estimate the amount of ULAE reserves applicable to estimated loss reserves at the balance sheet date.\n(2) Includes estimated future payments under the software license agreement relating to our policy issuance system. This agreement requires minimum monthly payments of $30,000, and is variable with premium volume. The future payment assumptions are based on the minimum monthly payments. The software license agreement expires on September 30, 2022.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $15.3 million and was primarily attributable to net investments into fixed maturity securities of $23.9 million, offset by the sale of short term investments of $10.3 million.\nGross written premiums increased $9.9 million, or 11.8%, to $93.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $83.8 million for the same period in 2014. The increase was driven by continued growth in our commercial lines, offset by the run-off personal automobile line. These results reflect our continued execution of our growth initiatives in the niche commercial insurance markets and our strategic change in the mix of business of our personal lines.\nOur expense ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and operating expenses by the sum of net earned premiums and other income. We use the expense ratio to evaluate the operating efficiency of our consolidated operations and each segment. Costs that are not readily identifiable as a direct cost of a segment or product line remain in Corporate and Other for segment reporting purposes.\nPremiums\nUnderwriting Results\nNet written premiums increased $13.4 million, or 20.2%, to $79.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $66.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Of this increase, $7.3 million is due to the termination of a quota share reinsurance agreement which occurred on August 1, 2015. The quota share arrangement was terminated as management determined the Company no longer needed the leverage support of this reinsurance arrangement due to the added capital raised from the IPO. Excluding the impact of the quota share reinsurance agreement, the net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $6.1 million compared to the same period in 2014.\nExpense Ratio\n\nOur expense ratio increased by 1.9 percentage points for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in the ratio was primarily due to increased policy acquisition costs as ceding commissions from a quota share agreement reduced commission expense in the first seven months of 2015. This increase was partially offset by improved operating expense ratios as we gained efficiencies from an improved earned premium base.\n\u2022 Any other information considered pertinent to estimating the indemnity and expense exposure presented by the claim.\nInsurance operations are subject to various leverage tests (e.g., premium-to-statutory surplus ratios), which are evaluated by regulators and rating agencies. As of December 31, 2016, on a trailing twelve-month statutory combined basis, the gross written and net written premium leverage ratios were 1.9 to 1.0 and 1.6 to 1.0, respectively.", "item_7_tables":
