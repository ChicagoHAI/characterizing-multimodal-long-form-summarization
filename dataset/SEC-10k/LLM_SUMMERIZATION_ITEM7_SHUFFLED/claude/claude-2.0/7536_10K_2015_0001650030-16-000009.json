Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nThe company is a global provider of products, services, and solutions to industrial and commercial users of electronic components and enterprise computing solutions. The company provides one of the broadest product offerings in the electronic components and enterprise computing solutions distribution industries and a wide range of value-added services to help customers introduce innovative products, reduce their time to market, and enhance their overall competitiveness. The company has two business segments, the global components business segment and the global ECS business segment. The company distributes electronic components to OEMs and CMs through its global components business segment and provides enterprise computing solutions to VARs through its global ECS business segment. For 2015, approximately 62% of the company's sales were from the global components business segment and approximately 38% of the company's sales were from the global ECS business segment.\nThe company's financial objectives are to grow sales faster than the market, increase the markets served, grow profits faster than sales, and increase return on invested capital. To achieve its objectives, the company seeks to capture significant opportunities to grow across products, markets, and geographies. To supplement its organic growth strategy, the company continually evaluates strategic acquisitions to broaden its product and value-added service offerings, increase its market penetration, and/or expand its geographic reach.\nExecutive Summary\nConsolidated sales for 2015 increased by 2.3%, compared with the year-earlier period, due to a 0.6% increase in the global components business segment sales and a 5.0% increase in the global ECS business segment sales. The translation of the company's international financial statements into U.S. dollars resulted in a decrease in consolidated sales of 5.4% for 2015 compared with the year-earlier period, due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Adjusted for the change in foreign currencies and acquisitions, consolidated sales increased 2.9% compared with the year-earlier period.\nNet income attributable to shareholders for 2015 of $497.7 million was relatively flat compared with net income attributable to shareholders of $498.0 million in the year-earlier period. The following items impacted the comparability of the company's results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>restructuring, integration, and other charges of $68.8 million ($51.3 million net of related taxes) in 2015 and $39.8 million ($29.3 million net of related taxes) in 2014;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>identifiable intangible asset amortization of $51.0 million ($41.3 million net of related taxes) in 2015 and $44.1 million ($36.0 million net of related taxes) in 2014;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a gain on sale of investment of $2.0 million ($1.7 million net of related taxes) in 2015 and $29.7 million ($18.3 million net of related taxes) in 2014;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a loss on investment of $3.0 million ($1.8 million net of related taxes) in 2015;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a loss on prepayment of debt of $2.9 million ($1.8 million net of related taxes) in 2015; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a non-cash impairment charge associated with discontinuing the use of a trade name of $78.0 million ($47.9 million net of related taxes) in 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExcluding the aforementioned items, net income attributable to shareholders for 2015 of $592.3 million was relatively flat compared with $593.0 million in the year-earlier period.\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), the company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial information, including:\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sales, income, or expense items as adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies (referred to as \"impact of changes in foreign currencies\") and the impact of acquisitions by adjusting the company's prior periods to include the operating results of businesses acquired, including the amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented (referred to as \"impact of acquisitions\");\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating income as adjusted to exclude identifiable intangible asset amortization, restructuring, integration, and other charges, and impairment charge; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net income attributable to shareholders as adjusted to exclude identifiable intangible asset amortization, restructuring, integration, and other charges, impairment charge, gain on sale of investment, loss on investment, loss on prepayment of debt, and settlement of certain international tax matters.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand the company's operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business adjusted for these items in addition to GAAP results. However, analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, data presented in accordance with GAAP.\nSales\nSubstantially all of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. As such, the nature of the company's business does not provide for the visibility of material forward-looking information from its customers and suppliers beyond a few months.\nFollowing is an analysis of net sales by business segment for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated sales, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of changes in foreign currencies\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,315\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions\n</td> <td>403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated sales, as adjusted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global components sales, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of changes in foreign currencies\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(737\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions\n</td> <td>320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global components sales, as adjusted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global ECS sales, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of changes in foreign currencies\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(578\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global ECS sales, as adjusted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated sales for 2015 increased by $513.3 million, or 2.3%, compared with the year-earlier period.

Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's consolidated sales increased by 2.9% in 2015, compared with the year-earlier period. The translation of the company's international financial statements into U.S. dollars resulted in a decrease in consolidated sales of 5.4% for 2015 compared with the year-earlier period.\nIn the global components business segment, sales for 2015 increased 0.6%, compared with the year-earlier period primarily driven by increased demand in the EMEA regions and the impact of recently acquired businesses, offset in part, by the impact of changes in foreign currencies. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's global components business segment sales increased by 1.3% in 2015, compared with the year-earlier period.\nIn the global ECS business segment, sales for 2015 increased 5.0% primarily driven by increased demand in the EMEA regions and the impact of recently acquired businesses, offset in part, by the impact of changes in foreign currencies.

Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's consolidated sales increased by 2.5% in 2014, compared with the year-earlier period.\nIn the global components business segment, sales for 2014 increased 6.1% compared with the year-earlier period primarily due to an increase in demand for products worldwide and the impact of recently acquired businesses.

During the fourth quarter of 2014, in connection with the company's global re-branding initiative to brand certain of its businesses under the Arrow name, the company made the decision to discontinue the use of a trade name of one of its businesses within the global ECS business segment.

Liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of the company's business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. It is the company's current intent to permanently reinvest these funds outside the United States and its current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund its United States operations. If these funds were to be needed for the company's operations in the United States it would be required to record and pay significant United States income taxes to repatriate these funds. Additionally, local government regulations may restrict the company's ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances.

The related loss on the redemption for the year ended December 31, 2013 aggregated $4.3 million ($2.6 million net of related taxes or $.03 per share on both a basic and diluted basis) and was recognized as a loss on prepayment of debt in the company's consolidated statements of operations.\nThe company has a $1.50 billion revolving credit facility, maturing in December 2018. This facility may be used by the company for general corporate purposes including working capital in the ordinary course of business, letters of credit, repayment, prepayment or purchase of long-term indebtedness and acquisitions, and as support for the company's commercial paper program, as applicable. Interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is calculated using a base rate or a euro currency rate plus a spread (1.30% at December 31, 2015), which is based on the company's credit ratings, for an effective interest rate of 1.58% at December 31, 2015.

The asset securitization program is conducted through Arrow Electronics Funding Corporation (\"AFC\"), a wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary. The asset securitization program does not qualify for sale treatment. Accordingly, the accounts receivable and related debt obligation remain on the company's consolidated balance sheets. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a base rate or a commercial paper rate plus a spread (.40% at December 31, 2015), which is based on the company's credit ratings, for an effective interest rate of .86% at December 31, 2015. The facility fee is .40%. The company had $75.0 million and $275.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the asset securitization program at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the average daily balance outstanding under the asset securitization program was $498.7 million and $488.2 million, respectively.\nBoth the revolving credit facility and asset securitization program include terms and conditions that limit the incurrence of additional borrowings and require that certain financial ratios be maintained at designated levels.

Under this agreement, the company may borrow up to a total of $100.0 million. There were no outstanding borrowings under the uncommitted line of credit at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nIn the normal course of business certain of the company's subsidiaries have agreements to sell, without recourse, selected trade receivables to financial institutions. The company does not retain financial or legal interests in these receivables, and accordingly they are accounted for as sales of the related receivables and the receivables are removed from the company's consolidated balance sheets. Financing costs related to these transactions were not material and are included in \"Interest and other financing expense, net\" in the company's consolidated statements of operations.\nThe company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC in October 2015 registering debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, and warrants of Arrow Electronics, Inc. that may be issued by the company from time to time. As set forth in the shelf registration statement, the net proceeds from the sale of the offered securities may be used by the company for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and stock repurchases, or for such other purposes as may be specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.\nManagement believes that the company's current cash availability, its current borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility and asset securitization program, its expected ability to generate future operating cash flows, and the company's access to capital markets are sufficient to meet its projected cash flow needs for the foreseeable future. The company continually evaluates its liquidity requirements and would seek to amend its existing borrowing capacity or access the financial markets as deemed necessary.\nContractual Obligations\nPayments due under contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Within 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>646,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>299,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,432,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,419,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt\n</td> <td>111,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>658,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>2,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>63,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (a)\n</td> <td>2,253,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>970,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,229,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (b)\n</td> <td>21,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,493,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,902,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>512,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,682,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,590,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Amounts represent an estimate of non-cancelable inventory purchase orders and other contractual obligations related to information technology and facilities as of December 31, 2015.

Also included are amounts relating to personnel, facilities, and certain other costs resulting from restructuring and integration activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder the terms of various joint venture agreements, the company is required to pay its pro-rata share of the third party debt of the joint ventures in the event that the joint ventures are unable to meet their obligations. There were no outstanding borrowings under the third party agreements of the joint ventures as of December 31, 2015.\nAt December 31, 2015, the company had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a liability for the payment of related interest totaling $45.8 million, of which approximately $.5 million is expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining liability, due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters, the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur.\nShare-Repurchase Programs\nDuring 2014, the company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") approved the repurchase of up to $400 million ($200 million in May and December, respectively) of the company's common stock through a share-repurchase program. In September 2015, the company's Board approved an additional repurchase of up to $400 million of the company's common stock. As of December 31, 2015, the company repurchased 8,474,574 shares under these programs with a market value of $480.2 million at the dates of repurchase, of which 2,617,991 shares with a market value of $149.6 million were repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe company has no off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. The company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances; the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe company believes the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\nRevenue Recognition\nThe company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue typically is recognized at time of shipment. Sales are recorded net of discounts, rebates, and returns, which historically have not been material.\nA portion of the company's business involves shipments directly from its suppliers to its customers. In these transactions, the company is responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and customer, payment to the supplier, establishing payment terms with the customer, product returns, and has risk of loss if the customer does not make payment. As the principal with the customer, the company recognizes the sale and cost of sale of the product upon receiving notification from the supplier that the product was shipped.\nThe company has certain business with select customers and suppliers that is accounted for on an agency basis (that is, the company recognizes the fees associated with serving as an agent in sales with no associated cost of sales). Generally, these transactions relate to the sale of supplier service contracts to customers where the company has no future obligation to perform under these contracts or the rendering of logistics services for the delivery of inventory for which the company does not assume the risks and rewards of ownership.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The allowances for doubtful accounts are determined using a combination of factors, including the length of time the receivables are outstanding, the current business environment, and historical experience.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Write-downs of inventories to market value are based upon contractual provisions governing price protection, stock rotation, and obsolescence, as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If assumptions about future demand change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company, additional write-downs of inventories may be required. Due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations, estimates are made regarding adjustments to the book cost of inventories. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated.\nInvestments\nThe company accounts for available-for-sale investments at fair value, using quoted market prices, and the related holding gains and losses are included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" in the shareholders' equity section in the company's consolidated balance sheets. The company assesses its long-term investments accounted for as available-for-sale on an ongoing basis to determine whether declines in market value below cost are other-than-temporary. When the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis for the individual security is reduced and a loss is realized in the company's consolidated statement of operations in the period in which it occurs. The company makes such determination after considering the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the investment is less than its cost, the financial condition and operating results of the investee, and the company's intent and ability to retain the investment over time to potentially allow for any recovery in market value. In addition, the company assesses the following factors:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>broad economic factors impacting the investee's industry;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>publicly available forecasts for sales and earnings growth for the industry and investee; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the cyclical nature of the investee's industry.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe company could incur an impairment charge in future periods if, among other factors, the investee's future earnings differ from currently available forecasts.\nIncome Taxes\nThe carrying value of the company's deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. Should the company determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance to the deferred tax assets would be established in the period such determination was made.\nIt is the company's policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. At December 31, 2015, the company believes it has appropriately accounted for any unrecognized tax benefits. To the extent the company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability, the company's effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe company uses various financial instruments, including derivative instruments, for purposes other than trading. Certain derivative instruments are designated at inception as hedges and measured for effectiveness both at inception and on an ongoing basis. Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked-to-market each reporting period with any unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings.\nThe company occasionally enters into interest rate swap transactions that convert certain fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt or variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt in order to manage its targeted mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt. The company also occasionally enters into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the rate on an anticipated future long term debt issuance. The company uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess the effectiveness of its interest rate swaps on a quarterly basis. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges is recorded as a change to\nthe carrying value of the related hedged debt, and the effective portion of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in the shareholders' equity section in the company's consolidated balance sheets in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\" The ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps, if any, is recorded in \"Interest and other financing expense, net\" in the company's consolidated statements of operations.\nContingencies and Litigation\nThe company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims related to environmental, regulatory, labor, product, tax, and other matters and assesses the likelihood of an adverse judgment or outcome for these matters, as well as the range of potential losses. A determination of the reserves required, if any, is made after careful analysis. The reserves may change in the future due to new developments impacting the probability of a loss, the estimate of such loss, and the probability of recovery of such loss from third parties.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe company records share-based payment awards exchanged for employee services at fair value on the date of grant and expenses the awards in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite employee service period. Stock-based compensation expense includes an estimate for forfeitures. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a market or performance condition is generally recognized over the vesting period of the award utilizing the graded vesting method, while all other awards are recognized on a straight-line basis. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the assumptions shown in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates. The company's estimates may be impacted by certain variables including, but not limited to, stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors, additional stock option grants, estimates of forfeitures, the company's performance, and related tax impacts.\nCosts in Excess of Net Assets of Companies Acquired\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The company tests goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter and/or when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Examples of such events and circumstances that the company would consider include the following:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the company operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers), a change in the market for the company's products or services, or a regulatory or political development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cost factors such as increases in raw materials, labor, or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers; contemplation of bankruptcy; or litigation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>events affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets, a more-likely-than-not expectation of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit, the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, or recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a sustained decrease in share price (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill is tested at a level of reporting referred to as \"the reporting unit.\" The company's reporting units are defined as each of the three regional businesses within the global components business segment, which are the Americas, EMEA, and Asia/Pacific and each of the two regional businesses within the global ECS business segment, which are North America and EMEA.\nAn entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The company has elected not to perform the qualitative assessment and began its impairment testing with the first step of the two-step impairment process. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, compares the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is less than its fair value, no impairment exists and the\nsecond step is not performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.\nThe company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach. For the purposes of the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The assumptions included in the income approach include forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, forecasted capital expenditures, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others, all of which require significant judgments by management. Actual results may differ from those assumed in the company's forecasts. The company also reconciles its discounted cash flow analysis to its current market capitalization allowing for a reasonable control premium. As of the first day of the fourth quarters of 2015, 2014, and 2013, the company's annual impairment testing did not indicate impairment at any of the company's reporting units.\nA decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the company's businesses, and the company could be required to record an impairment charge in the future, which could impact the company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as the company's consolidated statement of operations. If the company was required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the company has $2.37 billion of goodwill, of which approximately $1.10 billion, $70.0 million and $60.7 million was allocated to the Americas, EMEA, and Asia/Pacific reporting units within the global components business segment, respectively and $760.9 million and $377.1 million was allocated to the North America and EMEA reporting units within the global ECS business segment, respectively. As of the date of the company's latest impairment test, the fair value of the Americas, EMEA, and Asia/Pacific reporting units within the global components business segment and the fair value of the North America and EMEA reporting units within the global ECS business segment exceeded their carrying values by approximately 20%, 187%, 26%, 338%, and 177%, respectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe company reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant, and equipment and identifiable intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable. The company also tests indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of acquired trade names, for impairment at least annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference.\nFactors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life. If any of these factors exist, the company is required to test the long-lived asset for recoverability and may be required to recognize an impairment charge for all or a portion of the asset's carrying value.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, in connection with the company's global re-branding initiative to brand certain of its businesses under the Arrow name, the company made the decision to discontinue the use of a trade name of one of its businesses within the global ECS business segment. As no future cash flows will be attributed to the impacted trade name, the entire book value was written-off, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $78.0 million ($47.9 million net of related taxes or $.49 and $.48 per share on a basic and diluted basis, respectively) as of December 31, 2014 in the company's consolidated statements of operations. Fair value was determined using unobservable (Level 3) inputs. The impairment charge did not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings. No impairment existed as of December 31, 2014 with respect to the company's other identifiable intangible assets.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Topic 825) (\"ASU No. 2016-01\"). ASU No. 2016-01 revises the classification and measurement of investments in certain equity investments and the presentation of certain fair value changes for certain financial liabilities measured at fair value. ASU No. 2016-01 requires the change in fair value of\nmany equity investments to be recognized in net income. ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Adopting ASU No. 2016-01 may result in a cumulative effect adjustment to the consolidated statement of equity retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. The company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-01.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Income Taxes - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740) (\"ASU No. 2015-17\"). ASU No. 2015-17 requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. ASU No. 2015-17 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. ASU No. 2015-17 may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2015-17 is not expected to have a material impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16, Business Combinations - Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments (Topic 805) (\"ASU No. 2015-16\"). ASU No. 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. ASU No. 2015-16 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied on a prospective basis. Effective June 28, 2015, the company adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2015-16. The adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2015-16 did not materially impact the company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, Inventory - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330) (\"ASU No. 2015-11\"). ASU No. 2015-11 requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope of the update at the lower of cost and net realizable value, and defines net realizable value as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. ASU No. 2015-11 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied on a prospective basis. The adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2015-17 is not expected to have a material impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) (\"ASU No. 2015-03\"). ASU No. 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding debt liability. In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements (Subtopic 835-30) (\"ASU No. 2015-15\"). ASU No. 2015-15 provides additional guidance on the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements. ASU No. 2015-03 and ASU No. 2015-15 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied on a retrospective basis. Effective January 1, 2015 and June 28, 2015, the company adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2015-03 and ASU No. 2015-15, respectively. The adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2015-03 and ASU No. 2015-15 did not materially impact the company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. Prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASU No. 2014-09\"). ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. Additionally, ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. Under ASU No. 2014-09, an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. This includes significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early application permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU No. 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. The company is evaluating the transition method that will be elected and the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2014-09.\nInformation Relating to Forward-Looking Statements\nThis report includes forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: industry conditions, the company's implementation of its new enterprise resource planning system, changes in product supply, pricing and customer demand, competition, other vagaries in the global components and global ECS markets, changes in relationships with key suppliers, increased profit margin pressure, the effects of additional actions taken to become more efficient or lower costs, risks related to the integration of acquired businesses, changes in legal and regulatory matters, and the company's ability to generate additional cash flow.

The company assesses its long-term investments accounted for as available-for-sale on an ongoing basis to determine whether declines in market value below cost are other-than-temporary. When the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis for the individual security is reduced and a loss is realized in the company's consolidated statement of operations in the period in which it occurs. The company makes such determination after considering the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the investment is less than its cost, the financial condition and operating results of the investee, and the company's intent and ability to retain the investment over time to potentially allow for any recovery in market value. In addition, the company assesses the following factors:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization, as reported\n</td> <td>156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses, as reported\n</td> <td>2,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of changes in foreign currencies\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses, as adjusted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses as a percentage of sales, as reported\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses as a percentage of sales, as adjusted\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>bps\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, the company does not anticipate there will be any material adjustments relating to the aforementioned restructuring plans.

For the purposes of the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The assumptions included in the income approach include forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, forecasted capital expenditures, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others, all of which require significant judgments by management. Actual results may differ from those assumed in the company's forecasts. The company also reconciles its discounted cash flow analysis to its current market capitalization allowing for a reasonable control premium. As of the first day of the fourth quarters of 2015, 2014, and 2013, the company's annual impairment testing did not indicate impairment at any of the company's reporting units.\nDuring 2014, the company entered into an agreement for an uncommitted line of credit. Under this agreement, the company may borrow up to a total of $100.0 million. There were no outstanding borrowings under the uncommitted line of credit at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nThe carrying value of the company's deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. Should the company determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance to the deferred tax assets would be established in the period such determination was made.\nNet interest and other financing expense increased by 16.7% in 2015 to $135.4 million, compared with $116.0 million in 2014, primarily due to higher average debt outstanding that was used to refinance the company's 3.375% notes due November 1, 2015 before maturity and for general corporate purposes.\n (a) Amounts represent an estimate of non-cancelable inventory purchase orders and other contractual obligations related to information technology and facilities as of December 31, 2015.

These restructuring initiatives are due to the company's continued efforts to lower cost and drive operational efficiency. Integration costs are primarily related to the integration of acquired businesses within the company's pre-existing business and the consolidation of certain operations.\nExcluding the aforementioned items, net income attributable to shareholders for 2015 of $592.3 million was relatively flat compared with $593.0 million in the year-earlier period.\n \u2022 broad economic factors impacting the investee's industry; \nThe net amount of cash used for investing activities during 2014 was $244.8 million, primarily reflecting $162.9 million of cash consideration paid for acquired businesses, $122.5 million for capital expenditures, and $40.5 million of proceeds from sale of investment. Included in capital expenditures for 2014 is $57.0 million related to the company's global ERP initiative.\nThe company has a $1.50 billion revolving credit facility, maturing in December 2018. This facility may be used by the company for general corporate purposes including working capital in the ordinary course of business, letters of credit, repayment, prepayment or purchase of long-term indebtedness and acquisitions, and as support for the company's commercial paper program, as applicable. Interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is calculated using a base rate or a euro currency rate plus a spread (1.30% at December 31, 2015), which is based on the company's credit ratings, for an effective interest rate of 1.58% at December 31, 2015. The facility fee is.20%. The company had $72.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2015. There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2014. During\nIn the global ECS business segment, sales for 2014 increased 7.6% primarily driven by growth in software, services, storage and industry standard servers, offset, in part, by a decrease in demand for proprietary servers in the North America and EMEA regions. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's global ECS business segment sales were flat in 2014, compared with the year-earlier period.\nThe net amount of cash provided by the company's operating activities during 2013 was $450.7 million and was primarily due to earnings from operations, adjusted for non-cash items, offset in part, by an increase in net working capital to support an increase in sales.\n \u2022 the cyclical nature of the investee's industry. \nGain on Sale of Investment\nConsolidated sales for 2014 increased by $1.41 billion, or 6.6%, compared with the year-earlier period. The increase in 2014 was driven by an increase in global components business segment sales of $817.3 million, or 6.1%, and an increase in global ECS business segment sales of $594.1 million, or 7.6%, compared with the year-earlier period. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's consolidated sales increased by 2.5% in 2014, compared with the year-earlier period.\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Information\n\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe restructuring and integration charge of $38.3 million in 2014 includes personnel costs of $29.3 million, facilities costs of $5.6 million, and other costs of $3.5 million. These restructuring initiatives are due to the company's continued efforts to lower cost and drive operational efficiency. Integration costs are primarily related to the integration of acquired businesses within the company's pre-existing business and the consolidation of certain operations.\nDuring 2014, the company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") approved the repurchase of up to $400 million ($200 million in May and December, respectively) of the company's common stock through a share-repurchase program. In September 2015, the company's Board approved an additional repurchase of up to $400 million of the company's common stock. As of December 31, 2015, the company repurchased 8,474,574 shares under these programs with a market value of $480.2 million at the dates of repurchase, of which 2,617,991 shares with a market value of $149.6 million were repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nThe company tests goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. During the fourth quarter of 2014, in connection with the company's global re-branding initiative to brand certain of its businesses under the Arrow name, the company made the decision to discontinue the use of a trade name of one of its businesses within the global ECS business segment. As no future cash flows will be attributed to the impacted trade name, the entire book value was written-off, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $78.0 million ($47.9 million net of related taxes or $.49 and $.48 per share on a basic and diluted basis, respectively) as of December 31, 2014 in the company's consolidated statements of operations. Fair value was determined using unobservable (Level 3) inputs. The impairment charge did not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings. No impairment existed as of December 31, 2014 with respect to the company's other identifiable intangible assets.\nAn entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The company has elected not to perform the qualitative assessment and began its impairment testing with the first step of the two-step impairment process. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, compares the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is less than its fair value, no impairment exists and the\nThe company recorded net income attributable to shareholders of $498.0 million for 2014, compared with net income attributable to shareholders of $399.4 million in the year-earlier period. Net income attributable to shareholders, as adjusted of $593.0 million\nIn the global ECS business segment, sales for 2015 increased 5.0% primarily driven by increased demand in the EMEA regions and the impact of recently acquired businesses, offset in part, by the impact of changes in foreign currencies. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's global ECS business segment sales increased by 5.6% in 2015, compared with the year-earlier period.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Income Taxes - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740) (\"ASU No. 2015-17\"). ASU No. 2015-17 requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. ASU No. 2015-17 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. ASU No. 2015-17 may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2015-17 is not expected to have a material impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.\nThe company recorded operating income of $824.5 million, or 3.5% of sales, in 2015 compared with operating income of $762.3 million, or 3.3% of sales, in 2014. Included in operating income for 2015 and 2014 were the previously discussed identifiable intangible asset amortization of $51.0 million and $44.1 million, respectively, restructuring, integration, and other charges of $68.8 million and $39.8 million, respectively, and impairment charge of $78.0 million in 2014. Excluding these items operating income, as adjusted was $944.3 million, or 4.1% of sales, in 2015 compared with operating income, as adjusted of $924.2 million, or 4.1% of sales, in 2014.\nRevenue Recognition\nInformation Relating to Forward-Looking Statements\nNet interest and other financing expense increased by 1.4% in 2014 to $116.0 million, relatively consistent compared with $114.4 million in 2013.\nBoth the revolving credit facility and asset securitization program include terms and conditions that limit the incurrence of additional borrowings and require that certain financial ratios be maintained at designated levels. The company was in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2015 and is currently not aware of any events that would cause non-compliance with any covenants in the future.\nThe company believes the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\nFollowing is an analysis of net sales by business segment for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\nIn addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), the company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial information, including:\n (b) Includes estimates of contributions required to meet the requirements of the Wyle defined benefit plan. Amounts are subject to change based upon the performance of plan assets, as well as the discount rate used to determine the obligation. The company does not anticipate having to make required contributions to the plans beyond 2025. Also included are amounts relating to personnel, facilities, and certain other costs resulting from restructuring and integration activities. \nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $273.1 million and $400.4 million, respectively, of which $232.6 million and $300.9 million, respectively, were held outside the United States. Liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of the company's business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. It is the company's current intent to permanently reinvest these funds outside the United States and its current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund its United States operations. If these funds were to be needed for the company's operations in the United States it would be required to record and pay significant United States income taxes to repatriate these funds. Additionally, local government regulations may restrict the company's ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. The company currently does not expect such regulations and restrictions to impact its ability to make acquisitions or to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout the global organization.\nFollowing is an analysis of net income attributable to shareholders for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\n\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, Inventory - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330) (\"ASU No. 2015-11\").

Included in capital expenditures for 2013 is $57.1 million related to the company's global ERP initiative.\nConsolidated sales for 2015 increased by 2.3%, compared with the year-earlier period, due to a 0.6% increase in the global components business segment sales and a 5.0% increase in the global ECS business segment sales. The translation of the company's international financial statements into U.S. dollars resulted in a decrease in consolidated sales of 5.4% for 2015 compared with the year-earlier period, due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Adjusted for the change in foreign currencies and acquisitions, consolidated sales increased 2.9% compared with the year-earlier period.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe company could incur an impairment charge in future periods if, among other factors, the investee's future earnings differ from currently available forecasts.\nThe company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.

To the extent the company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability, the company's effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nSales\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nDuring 2015, the company completed the sale of $350.0 million principal amount of 3.50% notes due in 2022 and $350.0 million principal amount of 4.00% notes due in 2025. The net proceeds of the offering of $688.2 million were used to refinance the company's 3.375% notes due November 2015 and for general corporate purposes.\n\nDuring 2014, the company sold its 1.9% equity ownership interest in WPG Holdings Co., Ltd. for proceeds of $40.5 million and accordingly recorded a gain on sale of investment of $29.7 million ($18.3 million net of related taxes or $.19 and $.18 per share on a basic and diluted basis).\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nPayments due under contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):\nThe company has an asset securitization program collateralized by accounts receivable of certain of its subsidiaries. The company may borrow up to $900 million under the asset securitization program, which matures in March 2017. The asset securitization program is conducted through Arrow Electronics Funding Corporation (\"AFC\"), a wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary. The asset securitization program does not qualify for sale treatment. Accordingly, the accounts receivable and related debt obligation remain on the company's consolidated balance sheets. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a base rate or a commercial paper rate plus a spread (.40% at December 31, 2015), which is based on the company's credit ratings, for an effective interest rate of.86% at December 31, 2015. The facility fee is.40%. The company had $75.0 million and $275.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the asset securitization program at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the average daily balance outstanding under the asset securitization program was $498.7 million and $488.2 million, respectively.\n2015 Charges\nConsolidated sales for 2015 increased by $513.3 million, or 2.3%, compared with the year-earlier period. The increase in 2015 was driven by an increase in global components business segment sales of $92.8 million, or 0.6%, and an increase in global ECS business segment sales of $420.6 million, or 5.0%, compared with the year-earlier period. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's consolidated sales increased by 2.9% in 2015, compared with the year-earlier period. The translation of the company's international financial statements into U.S. dollars resulted in a decrease in consolidated sales of 5.4% for 2015 compared with the year-earlier period.\nThe company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue typically is recognized at time of shipment. Sales are recorded net of discounts, rebates, and returns, which historically have not been material.\nTrade Name Impairment Charge\nDuring 2015, the company redeemed $250.0 million principal amount of its 3.375% notes due November 2015. The related loss on the redemption for the year-ended December 31, 2015 aggregated $2.9 million ($1.8 million net of related taxes or $.02 per share on both a basic and diluted basis) and was recognized as a loss on prepayment of debt in the company's consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring 2015, the net amount of cash provided by the company's operating activities was $655.1 million, the net amount of cash used for investing activities was $664.0 million, and the net amount of cash used for financing activities was $84.2 million. The effect of exchange rate changes on cash was a decrease of $34.1 million.\nto authorized distributor agreements, which are typically cancelable by either party at any time or on short notice, usually within a few months.\nDepreciation and amortization expense for 2014 increased by $24.9 million, or 19.0%, compared with the year-earlier period, primarily due to acquisitions and further implementation of the company's ERP initiative. Included in depreciation and amortization expense for 2014 and 2013 was $44.1 million ($36.0 million net of related taxes or $.36 per share on both a basic and diluted basis) and $36.8 million ($29.3 million net of related taxes or $.29 and $.28 per share on a basic and diluted basis, respectively), respectively, related to identifiable intangible asset amortization.\n\nShare-Repurchase Programs\nThe company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC in October 2015 registering debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, and warrants of Arrow Electronics, Inc. that may be issued by the company from time to time. As set forth in the shelf registration statement, the net proceeds from the sale of the offered securities may be used by the company for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and stock repurchases, or for such other purposes as may be specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.\nThe company recorded operating income of $762.3 million, or 3.3% of sales, in 2014 compared with operating income of $693.5 million, or 3.2% of sales, in 2013.

Excluding these items operating income, as adjusted was $924.2 million, or 4.1% of sales, in 2014 compared with operating income, as adjusted of $822.9 million, or 3.9% of sales, in 2013.\nNet income attributable to shareholders for 2015 of $497.7 million was relatively flat compared with net income attributable to shareholders of $498.0 million in the year-earlier period. The following items impacted the comparability of the company's results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nManagement believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand the company's operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business adjusted for these items in addition to GAAP results. However, analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, data presented in accordance with GAAP.\n \u2022 a loss on investment of $3.0 million ($1.8 million net of related taxes) in 2015; \nThe net amount of cash provided by the company's operating activities during 2015 was $655.1 million and was primarily due to earnings from operations, adjusted for non-cash items, offset, in part, by an increase in net working capital to support the increase in sales.\nIn January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Topic 825) (\"ASU No. 2016-01\").

Stock-based compensation expense includes an estimate for forfeitures. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a market or performance condition is generally recognized over the vesting period of the award utilizing the graded vesting method, while all other awards are recognized on a straight-line basis. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the assumptions shown in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates. The company's estimates may be impacted by certain variables including, but not limited to, stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors, additional stock option grants, estimates of forfeitures, the company's performance, and related tax impacts.\nFollowing is an analysis of net income attributable to shareholders for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\nDuring 2013, the company acquired ComputerLinks, a value-added distributor of enterprise computing solutions with a comprehensive offering of IT solutions from many of the world's leading technology suppliers for aggregate consideration of $292.2 million, net of cash acquired. During 2013 the company completed four additional acquisitions for aggregate consideration of $75.7 million, net of cash acquired and contingent consideration.\nThe company has no off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.\nThis report includes forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: industry conditions, the company's implementation of its new enterprise resource planning system, changes in product supply, pricing and customer demand, competition, other vagaries in the global components and global ECS markets, changes in relationships with key suppliers, increased profit margin pressure, the effects of additional actions taken to become more efficient or lower costs, risks related to the integration of acquired businesses, changes in legal and regulatory matters, and the company's ability to generate additional cash flow. Forward-looking statements are those statements which are not statements of historical fact. These forward-looking statements can be identified by forward-looking words such as \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates,\" and similar expressions. Shareholders and other readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. The company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any of the forward-looking statements.\nAdjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, operating expenses (which include both selling, general, and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense) for 2015 increased 2.8%, on a sales increase, as adjusted, of 2.9%, due to the company's ability to efficiently manage operating costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring 2013, the company completed the sale of $300.0 million principal amount of its 3.00% notes due in 2018 and $300.0 million principal amount of its 4.50% notes due in 2023.

The company continually evaluates its liquidity requirements and would seek to amend its existing borrowing capacity or access the financial markets as deemed necessary.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses and Depreciation and Amortization\nFollowing is an analysis of operating income for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\nAdjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, operating expenses (which include both selling, general, and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense) for 2014 decreased 0.8%, on a sales increase, as adjusted, of 2.5%, due to the company's ability to efficiently manage operating costs.\nThe company's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are impacted by, among other factors, the statutory tax rates in the countries in which it operates and the related level of income generated by these operations.\nGoodwill is tested at a level of reporting referred to as \"the reporting unit.\" The company's reporting units are defined as each of the three regional businesses within the global components business segment, which are the Americas, EMEA, and Asia/Pacific and each of the two regional businesses within the global ECS business segment, which are North America and EMEA.\nIn the global components business segment, sales for 2014 increased 6.1% compared with the year-earlier period primarily due to an increase in demand for products worldwide and the impact of recently acquired businesses. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's global components business segment sales increased by 4.2% in 2014, compared with the year-earlier period.\nThe company has certain business with select customers and suppliers that is accounted for on an agency basis (that is, the company recognizes the fees associated with serving as an agent in sales with no associated cost of sales). Generally, these transactions relate to the sale of supplier service contracts to customers where the company has no future obligation to perform under these contracts or the rendering of logistics services for the delivery of inventory for which the company does not assume the risks and rewards of ownership.\nIn the normal course of business certain of the company's subsidiaries have agreements to sell, without recourse, selected trade receivables to financial institutions. The company does not retain financial or legal interests in these receivables, and accordingly they are accounted for as sales of the related receivables and the receivables are removed from the company's consolidated balance sheets. Financing costs related to these transactions were not material and are included in \"Interest and other financing expense, net\" in the company's consolidated statements of operations.\n \u2022 Net income attributable to shareholders as adjusted to exclude identifiable intangible asset amortization, restructuring, integration, and other charges, impairment charge, gain on sale of investment, loss on investment, loss on prepayment of debt, and settlement of certain international tax matters. \nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASU No. 2014-09\"). ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. Additionally, ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. Under ASU No. 2014-09, an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. This includes significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early application permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU No. 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. The company is evaluating the transition method that will be elected and the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2014-09.\nA decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the company's businesses, and the company could be required to record an impairment charge in the future, which could impact the company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as the company's consolidated statement of operations. If the company was required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.\nDuring 2013, the net amount of cash provided by the company's operating activities was $450.7 million, the net amount of cash used for investing activities was $487.1 million, and the net amount of cash used for financing activities was $26.6 million. The effect of exchange rate changes on cash was an increase of $43.9 million.\nThe net amount of cash provided by the company's operating activities during 2014 was $673.3 million and was primarily due to earnings from operations, adjusted for non-cash items.\nGross Profit\nInvestments\nIn 2014, the company recorded restructuring, integration, and other charges of $39.8 million ($29.3 million net of related taxes or $.30 and $.29 per share on a basic and diluted basis, respectively). Included in the restructuring, integration, and other charges for 2014 is a restructuring and integration charge of $38.3 million related to initiatives taken by the company to improve operating efficiencies.

Write-downs of inventories to market value are based upon contractual provisions governing price protection, stock rotation, and obsolescence, as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If assumptions about future demand change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company, additional write-downs of inventories may be required. Due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations, estimates are made regarding adjustments to the book cost of inventories. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated.\nSubstantially all of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. As such, the nature of the company's business does not provide for the visibility of material forward-looking information from its customers and suppliers beyond a few months.\nFollowing is an analysis of gross profit for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\nmany equity investments to be recognized in net income. ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. Adopting ASU No. 2016-01 may result in a cumulative effect adjustment to the consolidated statement of equity retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. The company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-01.\nOperating Income\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFactors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life. If any of these factors exist, the company is required to test the long-lived asset for recoverability and may be required to recognize an impairment charge for all or a portion of the asset's carrying value.\nThe company recorded a provision for income taxes of $191.7 million (an effective tax rate of 27.7%) for 2015. The company's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for 2015 were impacted by the previously discussed restructuring, integration, and other charges, loss on prepayment of debt, gain on sale of investment, and loss on investment.

The related loss on the redemption for the year ended December 31, 2013 aggregated $4.3 million ($2.6 million net of related taxes or $.03 per share on both a basic and diluted basis) and was recognized as a loss on prepayment of debt in the company's consolidated statements of operations.\nThe company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The allowances for doubtful accounts are determined using a combination of factors, including the length of time the receivables are outstanding, the current business environment, and historical experience.\nThe company recorded gross profit of $3.00 billion and $2.79 billion for 2014 and 2013, respectively. Gross profit margins for 2014 increased by approximately 10 basis points, compared with the year-earlier period primarily due to a more favorable product mix in the global ECS business segment as compared with the year-earlier period, offset, in part, by competitive pricing pressure. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's consolidated gross profit margin decreased approximately 10 basis points in 2014, compared with the year-earlier period.\n \u2022 cost factors such as increases in raw materials, labor, or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows; \nDuring 2015, the company recorded a gain on sale of investment of $2.0 million ($1.7 million net of related taxes or $.02 per share on both a basic and diluted basis).\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.

The uses of cash from financing activities included $338.2 million of redemption of senior notes, $362.8 million of repurchases of common stock, and a $31.3 million decrease in short-term and other borrowings. The sources of cash from financing activities during 2013 were $591.2 million of net proceeds from a note offering, $71.4 million of net proceeds of long-term bank borrowings, and $43.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and other benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements.\nThe company occasionally enters into interest rate swap transactions that convert certain fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt or variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt in order to manage its targeted mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt. The company also occasionally enters into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the rate on an anticipated future long term debt issuance.

The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess.\nFollowing is an analysis of net sales by business segment for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\nAt December 31, 2015, the company had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a liability for the payment of related interest totaling $45.8 million, of which approximately $.5 million is expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining liability, due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters, the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur.\n \u2022 a sustained decrease in share price (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers). \n\nThe company recorded gross profit of $3.04 billion and $3.00 billion for 2015 and 2014, respectively.

The company also tests indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of acquired trade names, for impairment at least annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference.\nThe company accounts for available-for-sale investments at fair value, using quoted market prices, and the related holding gains and losses are included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" in the shareholders' equity section in the company's consolidated balance sheets. The company assesses its long-term investments accounted for as available-for-sale on an ongoing basis to determine whether declines in market value below cost are other-than-temporary. When the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis for the individual security is reduced and a loss is realized in the company's consolidated statement of operations in the period in which it occurs. The company makes such determination after considering the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the investment is less than its cost, the financial condition and operating results of the investee, and the company's intent and ability to retain the investment over time to potentially allow for any recovery in market value. In addition, the company assesses the following factors:\nAs of December 31, 2015, the company does not anticipate there will be any material adjustments relating to the aforementioned restructuring plans. Refer to Note 9, \"Restructuring, Integration, and Other Charges,\" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the company's restructuring and integration activities.\n* The sum of the components for consolidated operating income, as adjusted may not agree to totals, as presented, due to rounding.\n \u2022 publicly available forecasts for sales and earnings growth for the industry and investee; and \nThe company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach. For the purposes of the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The assumptions included in the income approach include forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, forecasted capital expenditures, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others, all of which require significant judgments by management. Actual results may differ from those assumed in the company's forecasts. The company also reconciles its discounted cash flow analysis to its current market capitalization allowing for a reasonable control premium. As of the first day of the fourth quarters of 2015, 2014, and 2013, the company's annual impairment testing did not indicate impairment at any of the company's reporting units.\nDuring 2014, the company entered into an agreement for an uncommitted line of credit. Under this agreement, the company may borrow up to a total of $100.0 million. There were no outstanding borrowings under the uncommitted line of credit at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nThe carrying value of the company's deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. Should the company determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance to the deferred tax assets would be established in the period such determination was made.\nNet interest and other financing expense increased by 16.7% in 2015 to $135.4 million, compared with $116.0 million in 2014, primarily due to higher average debt outstanding that was used to refinance the company's 3.375% notes due November 1, 2015 before maturity and for general corporate purposes.\n (a) Amounts represent an estimate of non-cancelable inventory purchase orders and other contractual obligations related to information technology and facilities as of December 31, 2015. Most of the company's inventory purchases are pursuant \nThe restructuring and integration charge of $39.1 million in 2015 includes personnel costs of $33.9 million, facilities costs of $4.2 million, and other costs of $1.0 million. These restructuring initiatives are due to the company's continued efforts to lower cost and drive operational efficiency. Integration costs are primarily related to the integration of acquired businesses within the company's pre-existing business and the consolidation of certain operations.\nExcluding the aforementioned items, net income attributable to shareholders for 2015 of $592.3 million was relatively flat compared with $593.0 million in the year-earlier period.\n \u2022 broad economic factors impacting the investee's industry; \nThe net amount of cash used for investing activities during 2014 was $244.8 million, primarily reflecting $162.9 million of cash consideration paid for acquired businesses, $122.5 million for capital expenditures, and $40.5 million of proceeds from sale of investment. Included in capital expenditures for 2014 is $57.0 million related to the company's global ERP initiative.\nThe company has a $1.50 billion revolving credit facility, maturing in December 2018. This facility may be used by the company for general corporate purposes including working capital in the ordinary course of business, letters of credit, repayment, prepayment or purchase of long-term indebtedness and acquisitions, and as support for the company's commercial paper program, as applicable. Interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is calculated using a base rate or a euro currency rate plus a spread (1.30% at December 31, 2015), which is based on the company's credit ratings, for an effective interest rate of 1.58% at December 31, 2015. The facility fee is.20%. The company had $72.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2015. There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2014. During\nIn the global ECS business segment, sales for 2014 increased 7.6% primarily driven by growth in software, services, storage and industry standard servers, offset, in part, by a decrease in demand for proprietary servers in the North America and EMEA regions. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's global ECS business segment sales were flat in 2014, compared with the year-earlier period.\nThe net amount of cash provided by the company's operating activities during 2013 was $450.7 million and was primarily due to earnings from operations, adjusted for non-cash items, offset in part, by an increase in net working capital to support an increase in sales.\n \u2022 the cyclical nature of the investee's industry. \nGain on Sale of Investment\nConsolidated sales for 2014 increased by $1.41 billion, or 6.6%, compared with the year-earlier period. The increase in 2014 was driven by an increase in global components business segment sales of $817.3 million, or 6.1%, and an increase in global ECS business segment sales of $594.1 million, or 7.6%, compared with the year-earlier period. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's consolidated sales increased by 2.5% in 2014, compared with the year-earlier period.\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Information\n\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe restructuring and integration charge of $38.3 million in 2014 includes personnel costs of $29.3 million, facilities costs of $5.6 million, and other costs of $3.5 million. These restructuring initiatives are due to the company's continued efforts to lower cost and drive operational efficiency. Integration costs are primarily related to the integration of acquired businesses within the company's pre-existing business and the consolidation of certain operations.\nDuring 2014, the company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") approved the repurchase of up to $400 million ($200 million in May and December, respectively) of the company's common stock through a share-repurchase program. In September 2015, the company's Board approved an additional repurchase of up to $400 million of the company's common stock. As of December 31, 2015, the company repurchased 8,474,574 shares under these programs with a market value of $480.2 million at the dates of repurchase, of which 2,617,991 shares with a market value of $149.6 million were repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nThe company tests goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. During the fourth quarter of 2014, in connection with the company's global re-branding initiative to brand certain of its businesses under the Arrow name, the company made the decision to discontinue the use of a trade name of one of its businesses within the global ECS business segment. As no future cash flows will be attributed to the impacted trade name, the entire book value was written-off, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $78.0 million ($47.9 million net of related taxes or $.49 and $.48 per share on a basic and diluted basis, respectively) as of December 31, 2014 in the company's consolidated statements of operations. Fair value was determined using unobservable (Level 3) inputs. The impairment charge did not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings. No impairment existed as of December 31, 2014 with respect to the company's other identifiable intangible assets.\nAn entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The company has elected not to perform the qualitative assessment and began its impairment testing with the first step of the two-step impairment process. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, compares the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is less than its fair value, no impairment exists and the\nThe company recorded net income attributable to shareholders of $498.0 million for 2014, compared with net income attributable to shareholders of $399.4 million in the year-earlier period. Net income attributable to shareholders, as adjusted of $593.0 million\nIn the global ECS business segment, sales for 2015 increased 5.0% primarily driven by increased demand in the EMEA regions and the impact of recently acquired businesses, offset in part, by the impact of changes in foreign currencies. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's global ECS business segment sales increased by 5.6% in 2015, compared with the year-earlier period.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Income Taxes - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740) (\"ASU No. 2015-17\"). ASU No. 2015-17 requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. ASU No. 2015-17 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. ASU No. 2015-17 may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2015-17 is not expected to have a material impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.\nThe company recorded operating income of $824.5 million, or 3.5% of sales, in 2015 compared with operating income of $762.3 million, or 3.3% of sales, in 2014. Included in operating income for 2015 and 2014 were the previously discussed identifiable intangible asset amortization of $51.0 million and $44.1 million, respectively, restructuring, integration, and other charges of $68.8 million and $39.8 million, respectively, and impairment charge of $78.0 million in 2014. Excluding these items operating income, as adjusted was $944.3 million, or 4.1% of sales, in 2015 compared with operating income, as adjusted of $924.2 million, or 4.1% of sales, in 2014.\nRevenue Recognition\nInformation Relating to Forward-Looking Statements\nNet interest and other financing expense increased by 1.4% in 2014 to $116.0 million, relatively consistent compared with $114.4 million in 2013.\nBoth the revolving credit facility and asset securitization program include terms and conditions that limit the incurrence of additional borrowings and require that certain financial ratios be maintained at designated levels. The company was in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2015 and is currently not aware of any events that would cause non-compliance with any covenants in the future.\nThe company believes the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\nFollowing is an analysis of net sales by business segment for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\nIn addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), the company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial information, including:\n (b) Includes estimates of contributions required to meet the requirements of the Wyle defined benefit plan. Amounts are subject to change based upon the performance of plan assets, as well as the discount rate used to determine the obligation. The company does not anticipate having to make required contributions to the plans beyond 2025. Also included are amounts relating to personnel, facilities, and certain other costs resulting from restructuring and integration activities. \nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $273.1 million and $400.4 million, respectively, of which $232.6 million and $300.9 million, respectively, were held outside the United States. Liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of the company's business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. It is the company's current intent to permanently reinvest these funds outside the United States and its current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund its United States operations. If these funds were to be needed for the company's operations in the United States it would be required to record and pay significant United States income taxes to repatriate these funds. Additionally, local government regulations may restrict the company's ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. The company currently does not expect such regulations and restrictions to impact its ability to make acquisitions or to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout the global organization.\nFollowing is an analysis of net income attributable to shareholders for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\n\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, Inventory - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330) (\"ASU No. 2015-11\").

Included in capital expenditures for 2013 is $57.1 million related to the company's global ERP initiative.\nConsolidated sales for 2015 increased by 2.3%, compared with the year-earlier period, due to a 0.6% increase in the global components business segment sales and a 5.0% increase in the global ECS business segment sales. The translation of the company's international financial statements into U.S. dollars resulted in a decrease in consolidated sales of 5.4% for 2015 compared with the year-earlier period, due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Adjusted for the change in foreign currencies and acquisitions, consolidated sales increased 2.9% compared with the year-earlier period.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe company could incur an impairment charge in future periods if, among other factors, the investee's future earnings differ from currently available forecasts.\nThe company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. The company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances; the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nDuring 2014, the net amount of cash provided by the company's operating activities was $673.3 million, the net amount of cash used for investing activities was $244.8 million, and the net amount of cash used for financing activities was $434.9 million.

The reserves may change in the future due to new developments impacting the probability of a loss, the estimate of such loss, and the probability of recovery of such loss from third parties.\nThe company maintains a significant investment in accounts receivable and inventories. As a percentage of total assets, accounts receivable and inventories were approximately 66.3% at December 31, 2015 and were approximately 67.4% at December 31, 2014.\nCosts in Excess of Net Assets of Companies Acquired\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, in connection with the company's global re-branding initiative to brand certain of its businesses under the Arrow name, the company made the decision to discontinue the use of a trade name of one of its businesses within the global ECS business segment. As no future cash flows will be attributed to the impacted trade name, the entire book value was written-off, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $78.0 million ($47.9 million net of related taxes or $.49 and $.48 per share on a basic and diluted basis, respectively) as of December 31, 2014 in the company's consolidated statements of operations. Fair value was determined using unobservable (Level 3) inputs. The impairment charge did not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings. No impairment existed as of December 31, 2014 with respect to the company's other identifiable intangible assets.\n\nIt is the company's policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. At December 31, 2015, the company believes it has appropriately accounted for any unrecognized tax benefits. To the extent the company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability, the company's effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nSales\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nDuring 2015, the company completed the sale of $350.0 million principal amount of 3.50% notes due in 2022 and $350.0 million principal amount of 4.00% notes due in 2025.

The company may borrow up to $900 million under the asset securitization program, which matures in March 2017. The asset securitization program is conducted through Arrow Electronics Funding Corporation (\"AFC\"), a wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary. The asset securitization program does not qualify for sale treatment. Accordingly, the accounts receivable and related debt obligation remain on the company's consolidated balance sheets. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a base rate or a commercial paper rate plus a spread (.40% at December 31, 2015), which is based on the company's credit ratings, for an effective interest rate of.86% at December 31, 2015. The facility fee is.40%. The company had $75.0 million and $275.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the asset securitization program at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the average daily balance outstanding under the asset securitization program was $498.7 million and $488.2 million, respectively.\n2015 Charges\nConsolidated sales for 2015 increased by $513.3 million, or 2.3%, compared with the year-earlier period. The increase in 2015 was driven by an increase in global components business segment sales of $92.8 million, or 0.6%, and an increase in global ECS business segment sales of $420.6 million, or 5.0%, compared with the year-earlier period. Adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, the company's consolidated sales increased by 2.9% in 2015, compared with the year-earlier period. The translation of the company's international financial statements into U.S. dollars resulted in a decrease in consolidated sales of 5.4% for 2015 compared with the year-earlier period.\nThe company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Stock-based compensation expense includes an estimate for forfeitures. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards with a market or performance condition is generally recognized over the vesting period of the award utilizing the graded vesting method, while all other awards are recognized on a straight-line basis. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the assumptions shown in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates.

Forward-looking statements are those statements which are not statements of historical fact. These forward-looking statements can be identified by forward-looking words such as \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates,\" and similar expressions. Shareholders and other readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. The company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any of the forward-looking statements.\nAdjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and acquisitions, operating expenses (which include both selling, general, and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense) for 2015 increased 2.8%, on a sales increase, as adjusted, of 2.9%, due to the company's ability to efficiently manage operating costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring 2013, the company completed the sale of $300.0 million principal amount of its 3.00% notes due in 2018 and $300.0 million principal amount of its 4.50% notes due in 2023.

ASU No. 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. This includes significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early application permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU No. 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. The company is evaluating the transition method that will be elected and the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2014-09.\nA decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the company's businesses, and the company could be required to record an impairment charge in the future, which could impact the company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as the company's consolidated statement of operations. If the company was required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.\nDuring 2013, the net amount of cash provided by the company's operating activities was $450.7 million, the net amount of cash used for investing activities was $487.1 million, and the net amount of cash used for financing activities was $26.6 million.

Write-downs of inventories to market value are based upon contractual provisions governing price protection, stock rotation, and obsolescence, as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If assumptions about future demand change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company, additional write-downs of inventories may be required. Due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations, estimates are made regarding adjustments to the book cost of inventories. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated.\nSubstantially all of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts.
