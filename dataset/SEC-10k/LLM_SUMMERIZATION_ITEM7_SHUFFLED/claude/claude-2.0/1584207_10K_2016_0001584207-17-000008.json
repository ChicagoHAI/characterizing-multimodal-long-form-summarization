The OneMain Acquisition has brought together two branch-based consumer finance companies with complementary strategies and locations. Together, we provide personal loans primarily to non-prime customers through our combined network of over 1,800 branch offices in 44 states as of December 31, 2016 and on a centralized basis as part of our centralized operations and our digital platform (our online consumer loan origination business). We also write credit and non-credit insurance covering our customers. In addition, we service loans owned by us and service or subservice loans owned by third parties.\nOUR PRODUCTS\nOur product offerings include:\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Personal Loans - We offer personal loans through our combined branch network and over the Internet through our centralized operations to customers who generally need timely access to cash. Our personal loans are typically non-revolving with a fixed-rate and a fixed, original term of three to six years and are secured by consumer goods, automobiles, or other personal property or are unsecured. At December 31, 2016, we had over 2.2 million personal loans, representing $13.6 billion of net finance receivables, of which 43% were secured by collateral, compared to 2.2 million personal loans totaling $13.3 billion at December 31, 2015, of which 27% were secured by collateral. Personal loans held for sale totaled $617 million at December 31, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Insurance Products - We offer our customers credit insurance (life insurance, disability insurance, and involuntary unemployment insurance) and non-credit insurance through both our combined branch network and our centralized operations. Credit insurance and non-credit insurance products are provided by the Springleaf insurance subsidiaries, Merit and Yosemite, and by the OneMain insurance subsidiaries, AHL and Triton. We also offer auto membership plans of an unaffiliated company as an ancillary product.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur products also included the SpringCastle Portfolio at December 31, 2015, as described below:\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>SpringCastle Portfolio - We service the SpringCastle Portfolio that was acquired through a joint venture in which we previously owned a 47% equity interest. On March 31, 2016, the SpringCastle Portfolio was sold in connection with the SpringCastle Interests Sale, as discussed in Recent Developments and Outlook\u201d below. These loans consisted of\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nunsecured loans and loans secured by subordinate residential real estate mortgages and include both closed-end accounts and open-end lines of credit. These loans were in a liquidating status and varied in substance and form from our originated loans. Unless we are terminated, we will continue to provide the servicing for these loans pursuant to a servicing agreement, which we service as unsecured loans due to the fact that the liens are subordinated to superior ranking security interests.\nOur non-originating legacy products include:\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Real Estate Loans - We ceased real estate lending in January of 2012, and during 2014, we sold $6.4 billion real estate loans held for sale. In connection with the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale and the December 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale (as discussed and defined in Recent Developments and Outlook\u201d below), we sold $308 million real estate loans held for sale. The remaining real estate loans may be closed-end accounts or open-end home equity lines of credit, generally have a fixed rate and maximum original terms of 360 months, and are secured by first or second mortgages on residential real estate. Predominantly, our first lien mortgages are serviced by third-party servicers, and we continue to provide servicing for our second lien mortgages (home equity lines of credit). At December 31, 2016, we had $144 million of real estate loans held for investment, of which 93% were secured by first mortgages, compared to $538 million at December 31, 2015, of which 38% were secured by first mortgages. Real estate loans held for sale totaled $153 million and $176 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Retail Sales Finance - We ceased purchasing retail sales contracts and revolving retail accounts in January of 2013. We continue to service the liquidating retail sales contracts and will provide revolving retail sales financing services on our revolving retail accounts. We refer to retail sales contracts and revolving retail accounts collectively as retail sales finance.\u201d\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOUR SEGMENTS\nAt December 31, 2016, we had three operating segments:\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Consumer and Insurance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Acquisitions and Servicing; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Real Estate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFollowing the OneMain Acquisition, we include OneMain's operations within the Consumer and Insurance segment. See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for more information about our segments.\nHOW WE ASSESS OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE\nWe closely monitor the primary drivers of pretax operating income, which consist of the following:\nNet Interest Income\nWe track the spread between the interest income earned on our finance receivables and the interest expense incurred on our debt, and continually monitor the components of our yield and our cost of funds.\nNet Credit Losses\nThe credit quality of our loans is driven by our long-standing underwriting philosophy, which takes into account the prospective customer's household budget, and his or her willingness and capacity to repay the proposed loan. The profitability of our loan portfolio is directly connected to net credit losses; therefore, we closely analyze credit performance. We also monitor recovery rates because of their contribution to the reduction in the severity of our charge-offs. Additionally, because delinquencies are an early indicator of future net credit losses, we analyze delinquency trends, adjusting for seasonality, to determine whether or not our loans are performing in line with our original estimates.\nOperating Expenses\nWe assess our operational efficiency using various metrics and conduct extensive analysis to determine whether fluctuations in cost and expense levels indicate operational trends that need to be addressed. Our operating expense analysis also includes a review of origination and servicing costs to assist us in managing overall profitability.\nBecause loan volume and portfolio size determine the magnitude of the impact of each of the above factors on our earnings, we also closely monitor origination volume and annual percentage rate.\nRecent Developments and Outlook\nONEMAIN ACQUISITION\nOn November 15, 2015, we completed our acquisition of OneMain. The OneMain Acquisition brings together two branch-based consumer finance companies with complementary strategies and locations, focused on the non-prime market in the United States.\nWe believe the OneMain Acquisition will result in a number of strategic benefits and opportunities, including:\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significant expansion of our geographical presence. We believe that our expanded footprint will allow us to reach new customers for our personal finance products and further enhance our reputation in the communities we serve.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Diversification of our customer base. Our branch customer base more than doubled as a result of the OneMain Acquisition and, in addition, we believe the OneMain Acquisition will enable us to extend our reach to higher credit score segments than we historically served.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Product opportunities and scale benefits. We expect the OneMain Acquisition to enable us to distribute existing Springleaf products through OneMain branches and leverage key OneMain sales practices to achieve greater scale benefits in existing Springleaf branches.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significant cost savings opportunities by combining complementary businesses. We expect the highly complementary nature of our two operating companies, including branch operations, to enable us to achieve significant ongoing cost savings. Expected drivers of cost savings include consolidation of branch operations, elimination of redundant centralized and corporate functions and greater efficiency of marketing programs. We expect to realize approximately $275 million - $300 million of cost synergies from the OneMain Acquisition by the end of 2017. This level of cost synergies is expected to include approximately $200 million of reductions in operating expenses to be fully realized by the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as an incremental $75 million - $100 million of costs that we do not expect to incur as a result of the OneMain Acquisition. We also anticipate incurring approximately $275 million of acquisition-related expenses to consolidate the two operating companies. As of December 31, 2016, we had incurred approximately $170 million of acquisition-related transaction and integration expenses ($108 million incurred during 2016).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe estimated synergies were derived by comparing the operating expenses expected in the second half of 2017 of the combined operations to the sum of operating expenses expected to be generated on a stand-alone basis, as if each company had the same business strategies. The foregoing estimates of synergies and charges in connection with consolidating the two companies and expectations regarding when they will be fully reflected in our results are subject to various risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Therefore, no assurance can be given as to when or if they will be realized. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 3 of this report.\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the OneMain Acquisition.\nLENDMARK SALE\nAs part of our initiative to close the OneMain Acquisition, on November 13, 2015, OMH and certain of its subsidiaries (the Branch Sellers\u201d) entered into an Asset Preservation Stipulation and Order and agreed to a Proposed Final Judgment (collectively, the Settlement Agreement\u201d) with the DOJ, as well as certain state attorneys general, to resolve any inquiries of the DOJ and such state attorneys general with respect to the OneMain Acquisition. Pursuant to this agreement, OMH agreed to divest 127 Springleaf branches across 11 states as a condition for approval of the OneMain Acquisition.\nOn November 12, 2015, the Branch Sellers entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Lendmark to sell 127 Springleaf branches and, subject to certain exclusions, the associated personal loans issued to customers of such branches, fixed non-information technology assets and certain other tangible personal property located in such branches to Lendmark (the Lendmark Sale\u201d). On May 2, 2016, the Branch Sellers completed the sale of 127 Springleaf branches to Lendmark for an\naggregate cash purchase price of $624 million. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the Settlement Agreement and the Lendmark Sale.\nSPRINGCASTLE INTERESTS SALE\nOn March 31, 2016, Springleaf Finance, Inc., SpringCastle Holdings, LLC ( SpringCastle Holdings\u201d) and Springleaf Acquisition Corporation ( Springleaf Acquisition\u201d and, together with SpringCastle Holdings, the SpringCastle Sellers\u201d), wholly owned subsidiaries of OMH, entered into a purchase agreement with certain subsidiaries of New Residential Investment Corp. ( NRZ\u201d and such subsidiaries, the NRZ Buyers\u201d) and BTO Willow Holdings II, L.P. and Blackstone Family Tactical Opportunities Investment Partnership-NQ-ESC L.P. (collectively, the Blackstone Buyers\u201d and together with the NRZ Buyers, the SpringCastle Buyers\u201d). Pursuant to the purchase agreement, on March 31, 2016, SpringCastle Holdings sold its 47% limited liability company interest in each of SpringCastle America, LLC, SpringCastle Credit, LLC and SpringCastle Finance, LLC, and Springleaf Acquisition sold its 47% limited liability company interest in SpringCastle Acquisition LLC, to the SpringCastle Buyers for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $112 million (the SpringCastle Interests Sale\u201d). SpringCastle America, LLC, SpringCastle Credit, LLC, SpringCastle Finance, LLC and SpringCastle Acquisition LLC are collectively referred to herein as the SpringCastle Joint Venture.\u201d\nAs a result of this sale, SpringCastle Acquisition and SpringCastle Holdings no longer hold any ownership interests of the SpringCastle Joint Venture. However, unless we are terminated, we will remain as servicer of the SpringCastle Portfolio under the servicing agreement for the SpringCastle Funding Trust.\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the SpringCastle Interests Sale.\nREAL ESTATE LOAN SALES\nOn August 3, 2016, SFC and certain of its subsidiaries sold a portfolio of second lien mortgage loans for aggregate cash proceeds of $246 million (the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale\u201d) and recorded a net loss in other revenues at the time of sale of $4 million. The proceeds from this sale, together with cash on hand, were used to pay off $375 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes that matured in the third quarter of 2016. Unless we are terminated or we resign as servicer, we will continue to service the loans included in this sale pursuant to a servicing agreement. The purchase and sale agreement and the servicing agreement include customary representations and warranties and indemnification provisions.\nOn December 19, 2016, SFC and certain of its subsidiaries sold a portfolio of first and second lien mortgage loans for aggregate cash proceeds of $58 million (the December 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale\u201d) and recorded a net loss in other revenues at the time of sale of less than $1 million.\nLIQUIDATION OF UNITED KINGDOM SUBSIDIARY\nOn August 16, 2016, we liquidated our United Kingdom subsidiary, Ocean Finance and Mortgages Limited, which had previously ceased originating real estate loans in 2012. In connection with this liquidation, we recorded a net gain in other revenues of $4 million resulting from a net realized foreign currency translation gain.\nOUTLOOK\nOn November 15, 2015, we completed the OneMain Acquisition, the most significant transaction undertaken by the Company to date. During 2016, many significant integration milestones were achieved, involving substantial changes in operating policies and procedures in the OneMain branch network and significant personnel realignment across our OneMain and Springleaf field management teams. In the second half of 2016, we developed and implemented unified pricing, credit, and underwriting models across our branches, consolidated branch incentive and commission plans, and configured former OneMain branches into the Springleaf data network. We completed the conversion of approximately 100 of the former OneMain branches (representing approximately 10% of the former OneMain branch network's net finance receivables) to the Springleaf loan origination and servicing system. This initial conversion, as well as the re-branding of all Springleaf branches and websites under the OneMain Financial\u201d name and logo, was completed on October 1, 2016. During January and February of 2017, all of the remaining former OneMain branches, as well as our centralized servicing operations, were converted to Springleaf systems, completing the integration.\nWe also continued to execute our strategy to increase the proportion of our loan originations secured by auto collateral (which typically have lower yields and credit losses relative to unsecured personal loans), particularly within the former OneMain\nbranches where secured loan originations have historically represented a smaller proportion of total originations than those of the former Springleaf branches. While we have been able to increase secured loan originations at former OneMain branches in recent quarters, not every unsecured loan customer has the collateral or the willingness to take on a secured loan, and we believe this has contributed to slower growth in personal loan net finance receivables than anticipated. As we continue to increase secured loans as a proportion of our total loan portfolio, our yields may be lower in future periods relative to our historical yields; however, we also expect a proportional improvement in net credit losses as secured loans become a greater proportion of our total loan portfolio.\nWith the systems conversion of the former OneMain branches having been successfully completed in the first quarter of 2017, we expect to be well positioned to resume growth in our net finance receivables beginning in the second quarter of 2017. In addition, with the successful execution of our secured lending and credit risk management strategies, we expect to experience lower future credit losses beginning in late 2017, consistent with our long-term historical experience prior to the acquisition of OneMain. No assurance can be given, however, that these actions and strategies will be effective, that we will be successful in implementing these actions and strategies, or that we will not incur increased credit losses or declines in or lower growth of our personal loan net finance receivables in the future.\nWith our experienced management team, long track record of successfully accessing the capital markets, and strong demand for consumer credit, we believe we are well positioned to execute on our strategic priorities of capturing the benefits of the OneMain Acquisition and strengthening our capital base through the following key initiatives:\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reinvigorating growth in receivables at OneMain through enhanced marketing strategies and product options, including an expansion of our direct auto lending;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Growing secured lending originations at OneMain with a goal of enhancing credit performance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Leveraging scale and cost discipline across the company to realize a total of approximately $275 million - $300 million of aggregate acquisition cost synergies. This level of cost synergies is expected to include approximately $200 million of reductions in operating expenses to be fully realized by the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as an incremental $75 million - $100 million of costs that we do not expect to incur as a result of the OneMain Acquisition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reducing leverage; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maintaining a strong liquidity level and diversified funding sources.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAssuming the U.S. economy continues to experience slow to moderate growth, we expect to continue our long history of strong credit performance and believe the strong credit quality of our loan portfolio will continue as the result of our disciplined underwriting practices and ongoing collection efforts. We have continued to see some migration of customer activity away from traditional channels, such as direct mail, to online channels (primarily serviced through our combined branch network), where we believe we are well suited to capture volume due to our scale, technology, and deployment of advanced analytics.\nTax Reform Proposals\nThe new presidential administration and several members of the U.S. Congress have indicated significant reform of various aspects of the U.S. tax code as a top legislative priority. A number of proposals for tax reform, including significant changes to corporate tax provisions, are currently under consideration. Such changes could have a material impact, either positive or negative, on our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, depending on the nature and extent of any changes to the U.S. tax code that are ultimately enacted into law. Additionally, changes to the U.S. tax code could more broadly impact the U.S. economy, which could potentially result in a material impact, either positive or negative, on the demand for our products and services and the ability of our customers to repay their loans. We cannot predict if or when any of these proposals to reform the U.S. tax code will be enacted into law and, accordingly, no assurance can be given as to whether or to what extent any changes to the U.S. tax code will impact us or our customers or our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nResults of Operations\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nOn November 15, 2015, we completed the OneMain Acquisition. The results of OneMain are included in our consolidated operating results and selected financial statistics from November 1, 2015 in the table below.

Adjusted pretax earnings (loss) represents income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes on a Segment Accounting Basis and excludes acquisition-related transaction and integration expenses, net gain (loss) on sales of personal and real estate loans, net gain on sale of SpringCastle interests, SpringCastle transaction costs, losses resulting from repurchases and repayments of debt (attributable to OMH), gains on fair value adjustments on debt (attributable to OMH), restructuring and transaction costs, debt refinance costs, and net loss on liquidation of our United Kingdom subsidiary. Management believes adjusted pretax earnings (loss) is useful in assessing the profitability of our segments and uses adjusted pretax earnings (loss) in evaluating our operating performance. Adjusted pretax earnings (loss) is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered supplemental to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes, net income, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe reconciliations of income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes attributable to

personal loan portfolio. Our personal loans are typically non-revolving with a fixed-rate and a fixed, original term of three to six years and are secured by consumer goods, automobiles, or other personal property or are unsecured. At December 31, 2016, 43% of our personal loans were secured by collateral, compared to 27% at December 31, 2015.\nDistribution of Finance Receivables by FICO Score\nThere are many different categorizations used in the consumer lending industry to describe the creditworthiness of a borrower, including prime, non-prime, and sub-prime. While our underwriting models are not based on FICO scores, we track and analyze the performance of our finance receivable portfolio using many different parameters, including FICO scores, which is widely recognized in the consumer lending industry.\nWe group FICO scores into the following credit strength categories:\nTable 287: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Prime: FICO score of 660 or higher\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 288: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Non-prime: FICO score of 620-659\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Sub-prime: FICO score of 619 or below\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur customers are described as prime at one end of the credit spectrum and sub-prime at the other. Our customers' demographics are in many respects near the national median, but may vary from national norms in terms of credit and repayment histories. Many of our customers have experienced some level of prior financial difficulty or have limited credit experience and require higher levels of servicing and support from our branch network.\nOur net finance receivables grouped into the following categories based solely on borrower FICO credit scores at the purchase, origination, renewal, or most recently refreshed date were as follows:\nTable 290: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Personal\nLoans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SpringCastle\nPortfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Real Estate\nLoans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Retail Sales Finance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FICO scores\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>660 or higher\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>620-659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>619 or below\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unavailable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FICO scores\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>660 or higher\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>620-659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>619 or below\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unavailable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDELINQUENCY\nWe consider the delinquency status of our finance receivable as the primary indicator of credit quality. We monitor delinquency trends to evaluate the risk of future credit losses and employ advanced analytical tools to manage our exposure and appetite. Our branch team members work with customers through occasional periods of financial difficulty and offer a variety of borrower assistance programs to help customers continue to make payments. Team members also actively engage in collection activities throughout the early stages of delinquency. We closely track and report the percentage of receivables that are 30-89 days past due as a benchmark of portfolio quality, collections effectiveness, and as a strong indicator of losses in coming quarters.\nWhen finance receivables are 60 days past due, we consider them delinquent and transfer collections management of these accounts to our centralized operations, as these accounts are considered to be at increased risk for loss. Use of our centralized operations teams for managing late stage delinquency allows us to apply more advanced collections technologies/tools and drives operating efficiencies in servicing. At 90 days past due, we consider our finance receivables to be nonperforming.\nThe following table presents (i) delinquency information of the Company's segments on a Segment Accounting Basis, (a

We monitor the allowance ratio to ensure we have a sufficient level of allowance for finance receivable losses to cover estimated incurred losses in our finance receivable portfolio.\nDuring 2016, the allowance for finance receivables for our consumer and insurance segment decreased $37 million, while the 60+ days delinquency ratio increased 40 basis points to 3.59% at December 31, 2016. The required allowance increase resulting from the higher delinquency ratio was more than offset by a decline of $81 million in our TDR finance receivables and a corresponding decline of $83 million in the allowance for TDR finance receivable losses during 2016.\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for more information about the changes in the allowance for finance receivable losses.\nTROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING\nWe make modifications to our finance receivables to assist borrowers during times of financial difficulties. When we modify a loan's contractual terms for economic or other reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties and grant a concession that we would not otherwise consider, we classify that loan as a TDR finance receivable.\nInformation regarding TDR finance receivables held for investment for each of the Company's segments on a Segment Accounting Basis, (a basis other than GAAP), as well as reconciliations to information regarding our total TDR finance receivables held for investment on a GAAP basis, were as follows:\nTable 302: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consumer\nand\nInsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisitions\nand\nServicing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Real\nEstate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Segment to\nGAAP\nAdjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TDR net finance receivables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for TDR finance receivable losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(97\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TDR net finance receivables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(509\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for TDR finance receivable losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(243\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSOURCES OF FUNDS\nWe finance the majority of our operating liquidity and capital needs through a combination of cash flows from operations, securitization debt, borrowings from conduit facilities, unsecured debt and equity, and may also utilize other corporate debt facilities in the future. As a holding company, all of the funds generated from our operations are earned by our operating subsidiaries.\nSFC's Offering of 8.25% Senior Notes\nOn April 11, 2016, SFC issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 8.25% SFC Notes due 2020 (the 8.25% SFC Notes\u201d) under the Indenture, pursuant to which OMH provided a guarantee of the notes on a senior unsecured basis. SFC used\na portion of the proceeds from the offering to repurchase approximately $600 million aggregate principal amount of its existing senior notes that mature in 2017 and the remainder for general corporate purposes. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on this offering.\nSecuritizations and Borrowings from Revolving Conduit Facilities\nDuring 2016, we (i) completed four consumer loan securitizations and one auto securitization, (ii) exercised our right to redeem the asset backed notes issued by the Springleaf Funding Trust 2013-B, and (iii) deconsolidated the previously issued securitized interests of the SpringCastle Funding Asset-backed Notes 2014-A. See Structured Financings\u201d later in this section for further information on each of our securitization transactions.\nDuring 2016, we (i) entered into one new conduit facility, (ii) extended the revolving periods on four existing revolving conduit facilities, (iii) amended four existing revolving conduit facilities to change the maximum principal balances, (iv) replaced the 2015 Warehouse Facility with the New Facilities and refinanced two of the New Facilities, and (v) terminated one revolving conduit facility. Net repayments under the notes of our existing revolving conduit facilities totaled $2.6 billion for 2016. The 2015 Warehouse Facility and the New Facilities are described in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report.\nSee Notes 12 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on our long-term debt, consumer loan securitization transactions and conduit facilities.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2016, we completed the following transactions:\nTable 303: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On February 1, 2017, we completed a private securitization transaction in which OneMain Direct Auto Receivables Trust 2017-1, a wholly owned special purpose vehicle of SFC, issued $300 million principal amount of notes backed by direct auto loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance ( UPB\u201d) of $300 million as of December 31, 2016.

See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on this subsequent transaction.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Transactions\nIn addition to cash received from our senior notes offering and securitization transactions, our sources of funds were favorably impacted by the following transactions:\nTable 305: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>SpringCastle Interests Sale;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 306: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Lendmark Sale;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 307: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 308: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>December 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on these transactions.\nUSES OF FUNDS\nOur operating subsidiaries' primary cash needs relate to funding our lending activities, our debt service obligations, our operating expenses (including acquisition-related transaction and integration expenses), payment of insurance claims and, to a lesser extent, expenditures relating to upgrading and monitoring our technology platform, risk systems, and branch locations.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $579 million of cash and cash equivalents, and during 2016, we generated net income attributable to OMH of $215 million. Our net cash inflow from operating and investing activities totaled $1.3 billion in 2016. At December 31, 2016, our scheduled principal and interest payments for 2017 on our existing debt (excluding securitizations) totaled $1.7 billion. As of December 31, 2016, we had $4.0 billion UPB of unencumbered personal loans and $368 million UPB of unencumbered real estate loans (including $216 million held for sale).\nBased on our estimates and taking into account the risks and uncertainties of our plans, we believe that we will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate our businesses and repay our obligations as they become due for at least the next 12 months.\nWe have previously purchased portions of our unsecured indebtedness, and we may elect to purchase additional portions of our unsecured indebtedness in the future. Future purchases may be made through the open market, privately negotiated transactions with third parties, or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers, all of which are subject to terms, prices, and consideration we may determine.\nLIQUIDITY\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operations of $1.3 billion for 2016 reflected net income of $243 million, the impact of non-cash items, and an unfavorable change in working capital of $115 million. Net cash provided by operations of $735 million for 2015 reflected a net loss of $93 million, the impact of non-cash items, and a favorable change in working capital of $97 million. Net cash provided by operations of $381 million for 2014 reflected net income of $589 million, the impact of non-cash items, and an unfavorable change in working capital of $107 million primarily due to costs relating to the real estate sales transactions.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities of $2 million for 2016 was primarily due to net principal collections and originations of finance receivables held for investment and held for sale, partially offset by the SpringCastle Interests Sale, the Lendmark Sale, the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale, and the December 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale. Net cash used for investing activities of $2.6 billion for 2015 was primarily due to the OneMain Acquisition. Net cash provided by investing activities of $1.8 billion for 2014 was primarily due to the sales of real estate loans held for sale originated as held for investment during 2014, partially offset by the purchase of investment securities.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used for financing activities of $1.7 billion for 2016 was primarily due to net repayments of long-term debt. Net cash provided by financing activities of $2.0 billion for 2015 reflected the debt issuances associated with the 2015-A and 2015-B securitizations. Net cash used for financing activities of $1.8 billion for 2014 was primarily due to the repayments of the secured term loan and the 2013-BAC trust notes in late March of 2014.\nLiquidity Risks and Strategies\nSFC's and OMFH's credit ratings are non-investment grade, which have a significant impact on our cost of, and access to, capital. This, in turn, can negatively affect our ability to manage our liquidity and our ability or cost to refinance our indebtedness.\nThere are numerous risks to our financial results, liquidity, capital raising, and debt refinancing plans, some of which may not be quantified in our current liquidity forecasts. These risks include, but are not limited, to the following:\nTable 309: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our inability to grow or maintain our personal loan portfolio with adequate profitability;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 310: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the effect of federal, state and local laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and practices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 311: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>potential liability relating to real estate and personal loans which we have sold or may sell in the future, or relating to securitized loans; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 312: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the potential for disruptions in the debt and equity markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe principal factors that could decrease our liquidity are customer delinquencies and defaults, a decline in customer prepayments, a prolonged inability to adequately access capital market funding, and unanticipated expenditures in connection with the integration of OneMain. We intend to support our liquidity position by utilizing some or all the following strategies:\nTable 313: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintaining disciplined underwriting standards and pricing for loans we originate or purchase and managing purchases of finance receivables;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 314: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pursuing additional debt financings (including new securitizations and new unsecured debt issuances, debt refinancing transactions and standby funding facilities), or a combination of the foregoing;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 315: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>purchasing portions of our outstanding indebtedness through open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices, as well as with such consideration, as we may determine; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 316: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>obtaining new and extending existing secured revolving facilities to provide committed liquidity in case of prolonged market fluctuations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHowever, it is possible that the actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or that one or more of our significant judgments or estimates could prove to be materially incorrect.\nOUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that limit their ability to pay dividends. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on these restrictions and the dividends paid by our insurance subsidiaries during 2014 through 2016.\nOUR DEBT AGREEMENTS\nThe debt agreements to which SFC, OMFH, and their subsidiaries are a party include customary terms and conditions, including covenants and representations and warranties. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the restrictive covenants under SFC's and OMFH's debt agreements, as well as the guarantees of SFC's and OMFH's long-term debt.\nStructured Financings\nWe execute private securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933.

We had no off-balance sheet exposure to losses associated with unconsolidated variable interest entities at December 31, 2016 or 2015, other than certain representations and warranties associated with the sales of the mortgage-backed retained certificates during 2014. As of December 31, 2016, we had no repurchase activity related to these sales.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe consider the following policies to be our most critical accounting policies because they involve critical accounting estimates and a significant degree of management judgment:\nALLOWANCE FOR FINANCE RECEIVABLE LOSSES\nWe estimate the allowance for finance receivable losses primarily on historical loss experience using a roll rate-based model applied to our finance receivable portfolios. In our roll rate-based model, our finance receivable types are stratified by delinquency stages (i.e., current, 1-29 days past due, 30-59 days past due, etc.) and projected forward in one-month increments using historical roll rates. In each month of the simulation, losses on our finance receivable types are captured, and the ending delinquency stratification serves as the beginning point of the next iteration. No new volume is assumed. This process is repeated until the number of iterations equals the loss emergence period (the interval of time between the event which causes a borrower to default on a finance receivable and our recording of the charge-off) for our finance receivable types.\nManagement exercises its judgment, based on quantitative analyses, qualitative factors, such as recent delinquency and other credit trends, and experience in the consumer finance industry, when determining the amount of the allowance for finance receivable losses. We adjust the amounts determined by the roll rate-based model for management's estimate of the effects of model imprecision which include but are not limited to, any changes to underwriting criteria, portfolio seasoning, and current economic conditions, including levels of unemployment and personal bankruptcies.\nPURCHASED CREDIT IMPAIRED FINANCE RECEIVABLES\nAs part of each of our acquisitions, we identify a population of finance receivables for which it is determined that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. We accrete the excess of the cash flows expected to be collected on the purchased credit impaired finance receivables over the discounted cash flows (the accretable yield\u201d) into interest income at a level rate of return over the expected lives of the underlying pools of the purchased credit impaired finance receivables. We update our estimates for cash flows on a quarterly basis incorporating current assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. If expected cash flows increase significantly, we adjust the yield prospectively; conversely, if expected cash flows decrease, we record an impairment.\nTDR FINANCE RECEIVABLES\nWhen we modify a loan's contractual terms for economic or other reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties and grant a concession that we would not otherwise consider, we classify that loan as a TDR finance receivable. When we modify an account we primarily use a combination of the following to reduce the borrower's monthly payment: reduce interest rate, extend the term, capitalize or forgive past due interest and, to a lesser extent, forgive principal. Account modifications that are deemed to be a TDR finance receivable are measured for impairment in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the accounting for impaired loans.\nThe allowance for finance receivable losses related to our TDR finance receivables represents loan-specific reserves based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows. We establish our allowance for finance receivable losses related to our TDR finance receivables by calculating the present value (discounted at the loan's effective interest rate prior to modification) of all expected cash flows less the recorded investment in the aggregated pool. We use certain assumptions to estimate the expected cash flows from our TDR finance receivables. The primary assumptions for our model are prepayment speeds, default rates, and severity rates.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nManagement is responsible for the determination of the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities and the supporting methodologies and assumptions. We employ widely used financial techniques or utilize third-party valuation service providers to gather, analyze, and interpret market information and derive fair values based upon relevant methodologies and assumptions for individual instruments or pools of finance receivables. When our valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security, we determine fair value either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a quote, which is generally non-binding, or by employing widely used financial techniques.\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nFor goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, we first complete a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test annually as of October 1 of each year. For goodwill, if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, we proceed with the two-step impairment test. When necessary, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated utilizing the\nincome approach, which uses prospective financial information of the reporting unit discounted at a rate that we estimate a market participant would use. For indefinite lived intangible assets, if the qualitative assessment indicates that the assets are more likely than not to have been impaired, we proceed with the fair value calculation of the assets.\nFor those net intangible assets with a finite useful life, we review such intangibles for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nSeasonality\nOur personal loan volume is generally highest during the second and fourth quarters of the year, primarily due to marketing efforts, seasonality of demand, and increased traffic in branches after the winter months. Demand for our personal loans is usually lower in January and February after the holiday season and as a result of tax refunds. Delinquencies on our personal loans are generally lowest in the first quarter and tend to rise throughout the remainder of the year. These seasonal trends contribute to fluctuations in our operating results and cash needs throughout the year.\nKey Financial Definitions\nTable 325: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

See Notes 12 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on our long-term debt, consumer loan securitization transactions, and our conduit facilities. \nOther revenues decreased $484 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the net of (i) transactions that occurred in 2014 including net gain on sales of real estate loans and related trust assets of $648 million, net loss on repurchases and repayments of debt of $66 million, and net loss on fair value adjustments on debt of $15 million, (ii) two months of other revenues of $59 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, which consisted of insurance revenues of $53 million, investment revenues of $1 million, and remaining other revenue of $5 million, (iii) net increase in revenues associated with the 2014 real estate loans sales of $4 million (higher investment revenue generated from investing the proceeds of the sales, partially offset by lower insurance revenue reflecting the cancellations of dwelling policies as a result of the sales), and (iv) increase in remaining other revenue of $20 million primarily due to lower net charge-offs recognized on finance receivables held for sale and provision adjustments for liquidated held for sale accounts during 2015.\n\nTable 293: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

pronouncements.\nInterest expense increased $78 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to (i) two months of interest expense of $52 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition and (ii) an increase in Springleaf interest expense of $26 million primarily due to the redistribution of the allocation of long-term debt as of November 1, 2015, based on the interim excess cash proceeds from the 2014 real estate loan sales used to finance the OneMain Acquisition, partially offset by a reduction in the utilization of financing from Springleaf unsecured notes that was replaced by consumer loan securitizations and additional borrowings under our conduit facilities, which generally have lower interest rates.\nAcquisition-related transaction and integration expenses incurred as a result of the OneMain Acquisition and the Lendmark Sale include (i) compensation and employee benefit costs, such as retention awards and severance costs, (ii) accelerated amortization of acquired software assets, (iii) rebranding to the OneMain brand, (iv) branch infrastructure and other fixed asset integration costs, (v) information technology costs, such as internal platform development, software upgrades and licenses, and technology termination costs, (vi) legal fees and project management costs, (vii) system conversions, including payroll, marketing, risk, and finance functions, and (viii) other costs and fees directly related to the OneMain Acquisition and integration.\nTable 265: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

estate loans held for sale increased $3 million primarily due to the transfers of $315 million of real estate loans to finance receivables held for sale during 2016, which were sold in August and December of 2016. \nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nBecause loan volume and portfolio size determine the magnitude of the impact of each of the above factors on our earnings, we also closely monitor origination volume and annual percentage rate.\nManagement uses adjusted pretax earnings (loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a key performance measure of our segments. Adjusted pretax earnings (loss) represents income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes on a Segment Accounting Basis and excludes acquisition-related transaction and integration expenses, net gain (loss) on sales of personal and real estate loans, net gain on sale of SpringCastle interests, SpringCastle transaction costs, losses resulting from repurchases and repayments of debt (attributable to OMH), gains on fair value adjustments on debt (attributable to OMH), restructuring and transaction costs, debt refinance costs, and net loss on liquidation of our United Kingdom subsidiary. Management believes adjusted pretax earnings (loss) is useful in assessing the profitability of our segments and uses adjusted pretax earnings (loss) in evaluating our operating performance. Adjusted pretax earnings (loss) is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered supplemental to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes, net income, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 290: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Since we acquired the OneMain personal loans at a premium, an allowance was recorded to reflect the losses inherent in the portfolio over the loss emergence period. Additionally, the allowance for finance receivable losses as a percentage of finance receivables for the acquired personal loans was expected to be higher, as the majority of these loans were unsecured. This increase was partially offset by (i) lower net charge-offs on the SpringCastle Portfolio reflecting the improved central servicing performance as the acquired portfolio matured under our ownership and (ii) lower net charge-offs and allowance requirements on our real estate loans reflecting the 2014 transfer of real estate loans previously discussed.\nunsecured loans and loans secured by subordinate residential real estate mortgages and include both closed-end accounts and open-end lines of credit.

allowance requirements totaling $92 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition and (ii) an increase in Springleaf provision for finance receivable losses of $57 million primarily due to growth during 2015 and a higher Springleaf personal loan delinquency ratio at December 31, 2015.\nWe believe the OneMain Acquisition will result in a number of strategic benefits and opportunities, including:\n \u2022 maintaining disciplined underwriting standards and pricing for loans we originate or purchase and managing purchases of finance receivables; \nThe new presidential administration and several members of the U.S. Congress have indicated significant reform of various aspects of the U.S. tax code as a top legislative priority. A number of proposals for tax reform, including significant changes to corporate tax provisions, are currently under consideration. Such changes could have a material impact, either positive or negative, on our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, depending on the nature and extent of any changes to the U.S. tax code that are ultimately enacted into law. Additionally, changes to the U.S. tax code could more broadly impact the U.S. economy, which could potentially result in a material impact, either positive or negative, on the demand for our products and services and the ability of our customers to repay their loans. We cannot predict if or when any of these proposals to reform the U.S. tax code will be enacted into law and, accordingly, no assurance can be given as to whether or to what extent any changes to the U.S. tax code will impact us or our customers or our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nComparison of Adjusted Pretax Operating Results for 2015 and 2014\nWe track the spread between the interest income earned on our finance receivables and the interest expense incurred on our debt, and continually monitor the components of our yield and our cost of funds.\nAs part of each of our acquisitions, we identify a population of finance receivables for which it is determined that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. We accrete the excess of the cash flows expected to be collected on the purchased credit impaired finance receivables over the discounted cash flows (the accretable yield\u201d) into interest income at a level rate of return over the expected lives of the underlying pools of the purchased credit impaired finance receivables. We update our estimates for cash flows on a quarterly basis incorporating current assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. If expected cash flows increase significantly, we adjust the yield prospectively; conversely, if expected cash flows decrease, we record an impairment.\n\nInterest expense for 2015 when compared to 2014 reflected higher interest expense on unsecured debt, which was allocated based on a higher cash balance held in anticipation of the OneMain Acquisition.\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for more information about the changes in the allowance for finance receivable losses.\n \u2022 potential liability relating to real estate and personal loans which we have sold or may sell in the future, or relating to securitized loans; and \nOUR PRODUCTS\nDuring 2016, we (i) completed four consumer loan securitizations and one auto securitization, (ii) exercised our right to redeem the asset backed notes issued by the Springleaf Funding Trust 2013-B, and (iii) deconsolidated the previously issued securitized interests of the SpringCastle Funding Asset-backed Notes 2014-A. See Structured Financings\u201d later in this section for further information on each of our securitization transactions.\nOther revenues decreased $19 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to (i) impairments of $10 million recognized on our real estate loans held for sale during 2016 and (ii) a decrease in investment revenues during 2016, as the prior period reflected higher investment income generated from investing the proceeds of the 2014 real estate loan sales.\n (a) Other consists of: \n \u2022 Personal Loans - We offer personal loans through our combined branch network and over the Internet through our centralized operations to customers who generally need timely access to cash. Our personal loans are typically non-revolving with a fixed-rate and a fixed, original term of three to six years and are secured by consumer goods, automobiles, or other personal property or are unsecured. At December 31, 2016, we had over 2.2 million personal loans, representing $13.6 billion of net finance receivables, of which 43% were secured by collateral, compared to 2.2 million personal loans totaling $13.3 billion at December 31, 2015, of which 27% were secured by collateral. Personal loans held for sale totaled $617 million at December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Other operating expenses increased $110 million primarily due to two months of other operating expenses of $63 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition and an increase in Springleaf other operating expenses of $47 million primarily due to (i) an increase in advertising expenses of $22 million, (ii) an increase in information technology expenses of $6 million reflecting increased depreciation and software maintenance as a result of software purchases and the capitalization of internally developed software, (iii) an increase in occupancy costs of $6 million resulting from increased general maintenance costs of our branches and higher leasehold improvement amortization expense from the servicing facilities added in 2014, (iv) an increase in professional fees of $5 million relating to legal and audit services, (v) an increase in credit and collection related costs of $4 million reflecting growth in personal loans, including our direct auto loans, and (vi) the redistribution of the allocation of other operating expenses as a result of the real estate loan sales in 2014. \n (c) OneMain finance charges for 2015 included two months of finance charges, net of a purchase accounting adjustment of $102 million primarily due to accretion of premium on OneMain personal loans, as a result of the OneMain Acquisition. \nProvision for finance receivable losses decreased $130 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to (i) the transfers of real estate loans with a total carrying value of $7.2 billion to finance receivables held for sale and the subsequent sales of nearly all of these real estate loans during 2014 and (ii) a lower real estate loan delinquency ratio at December 31, 2015.\n (b) Yield decreased primarily due to (i) the continued growth of secured personal loans, which generally have lower yields relative to our unsecured personal loans, and (ii) the effects of purchase accounting adjustments relating to the OneMain Acquisition. \nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that limit their ability to pay dividends. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on these restrictions and the dividends paid by our insurance subsidiaries during 2014 through 2016.\nFINANCE RECEIVABLE COMPOSITION\nOur operating subsidiaries' primary cash needs relate to funding our lending activities, our debt service obligations, our operating expenses (including acquisition-related transaction and integration expenses), payment of insurance claims and, to a lesser extent, expenditures relating to upgrading and monitoring our technology platform, risk systems, and branch locations.\nInterest expense decreased in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the net of the following:\nCredit Quality\n (b) Purchase accounting was not elected at the segment level. \nSPRINGCASTLE INTERESTS SALE\nContractual Obligations\nbranches where secured loan originations have historically represented a smaller proportion of total originations than those of the former Springleaf branches. While we have been able to increase secured loan originations at former OneMain branches in recent quarters, not every unsecured loan customer has the collateral or the willingness to take on a secured loan, and we believe this has contributed to slower growth in personal loan net finance receivables than anticipated. As we continue to increase secured loans as a proportion of our total loan portfolio, our yields may be lower in future periods relative to our historical yields; however, we also expect a proportional improvement in net credit losses as secured loans become a greater proportion of our total loan portfolio.\n \u2022 August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale; and \n\n \u2022 Other operating expenses increased $332 million primarily due to (i) other operating expenses of $306 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, which consisted primarily of advertising expenses of $74 million, occupancy costs of $66 million, amortization on other intangible assets of $57 million, and information technology expenses of $53 million, (ii) a decrease in Springleaf deferred origination costs of $12 million during 2016, and (iii) an increase in Springleaf information technology expenses of $12 million during 2016. \n \u2022 Insurance policy benefits and claims increased $71 million due to insurance policy benefits and claims of $88 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition. This increase was partially offset by a $17 million decrease in Springleaf insurance policy benefits and claims during 2016 primarily due to favorable variances in benefit reserves, which partially resulted from a $9 million write-down of benefit reserves recorded during 2016. \nOther expenses increased $224 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the net of the following:\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by SEC rules. We had no off-balance sheet exposure to losses associated with unconsolidated variable interest entities at December 31, 2016 or 2015, other than certain representations and warranties associated with the sales of the mortgage-backed retained certificates during 2014. As of December 31, 2016, we had no repurchase activity related to these sales.\nOn November 12, 2015, the Branch Sellers entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Lendmark to sell 127 Springleaf branches and, subject to certain exclusions, the associated personal loans issued to customers of such branches, fixed non-information technology assets and certain other tangible personal property located in such branches to Lendmark (the Lendmark Sale\u201d). On May 2, 2016, the Branch Sellers completed the sale of 127 Springleaf branches to Lendmark for an\nOther revenues increased $20 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily due to (i) lower net charge-offs recognized on real estate finance receivables held for sale and provision adjustments for liquidated real estate held for sale accounts during 2015 and (ii) investment income generated in 2015 from investing the proceeds of the real estate loan sales during 2014.\nThe principal factors that could decrease our liquidity are customer delinquencies and defaults, a decline in customer prepayments, a prolonged inability to adequately access capital market funding, and unanticipated expenditures in connection with the integration of OneMain. We intend to support our liquidity position by utilizing some or all the following strategies:\n (b) Weighted average interest rate on our debt decreased primarily due to (i) debt acquired from the OneMain Acquisition, which generally has a lower weighted average interest rate relative to SFC's weighted average interest rate, and (ii) the repurchase of $600 million unsecured notes, which had a higher interest rate relative to our other indebtedness, in connection with SFC's offering of the 8.25% SFC Notes, as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Part II - Item 7 of this report. The decrease was partially offset by (i) SFC's offering of the 8.25% SFC Notes in April of 2016 and (ii) the elimination of debt associated with the SpringCastle Interests Sale, which generally had a lower interest rate relative to our other indebtedness. \n \u2022 Salaries and benefits increased $125 million primarily due to (i) two months of salaries and benefits of $71 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, (ii) increased staffing in Springleaf centralized operations, and (iii) non-cash incentive compensation expense of $15 million recorded in 2015 relating to the rights of certain executives to receive a portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of OMH's common stock by the Initial Stockholder. \nAn index to our management's discussion and analysis follows:\nSee Notes 12 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on our long-term debt, consumer loan securitization transactions and conduit facilities.\n (a) On-balance sheet securitizations and borrowings under revolving conduit facilities are not included in maturities by period due to their variable monthly payments. At December 31, 2016, there were no amounts drawn under our revolving conduit facilities. \n \u2022 Other operating expenses increased $78 million primarily due to the net of (i) two months of other operating expenses of $71 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, (ii) an increase in Springleaf advertising expenses of $21 million, (iii) an increase in Springleaf information technology expenses of $8 million, (iv) costs of $7 million recorded in 2014 related to the real estate loan sales, and (v) a $6 million reduction in reserves related to Springleaf estimated Property Protection Insurance claims. \nNet finance receivables of the Other components (which are reported on a Segment Accounting Basis) were as follows:\nLIQUIDATION OF UNITED KINGDOM SUBSIDIARY\n \u2022 the effect of federal, state and local laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and practices; \nInterest income decreased in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the net of the following:\n (a) Represents securities sold at time of issuance or at a later date and does not include retained notes. \nNet Credit Losses\nRecent Developments and Outlook\n \u2022 Salaries and benefits decreased $21 million primarily due to the redistribution of the allocation of salaries and benefit expenses as a result of the real estate loan sales in 2014. \nSegment Accounting Basis\n\nWe assess our operational efficiency using various metrics and conduct extensive analysis to determine whether fluctuations in cost and expense levels indicate operational trends that need to be addressed. Our operating expense analysis also includes a review of origination and servicing costs to assist us in managing overall profitability.\nOther expenses increased $706 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 due to the following:\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the SpringCastle Interests Sale.\n\n \u2022 Finance charges decreased $24 million primarily due to the following: \n \u2022 the elimination of allowance for finance receivable losses of $1 million due to the transfer of personal loans held for investment to finance receivable held for sale during 2015. \nBenefit from income taxes totaled $133 million for 2015 compared to provision for income taxes of $272 million for 2014. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 59.0% compared to 31.6% for 2014. The effective tax rate for 2015 and 2014 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of the non-controlling interest in the previously owned SpringCastle Portfolio and state income taxes. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the effective rates.\n \u2022 Real Estate. \nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes attributable to OMH on a Segment Accounting Basis by segment was as follows:\n \u2022 On February 1, 2017, we completed a private securitization transaction in which OneMain Direct Auto Receivables Trust 2017-1, a wholly owned special purpose vehicle of SFC, issued $300 million principal amount of notes backed by direct auto loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance ( UPB\u201d) of $300 million as of December 31, 2016. See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on this subsequent transaction. \n \u2022 Finance charges increased $1.8 billion primarily due to the net of the following: \nTROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING\nThe largest component of our finance receivables and primary source of our interest income is our personal loan portfolio. Our personal loans are typically non-revolving with a fixed-rate and a fixed, original term of three to six years and are secured by consumer goods, automobiles, or other personal property or are unsecured. At December 31, 2016, 43% of our personal loans were secured by collateral, compared to 27% at December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 Interest income on finance receivables held for sale of $56 million and $43 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, resulted from the transfer of personal loans to finance receivables held for sale on September 30, 2015 and sold in the Lendmark Sale on May 2, 2016. \nSFC's Offering of 8.25% Senior Notes\n\n \u2022 Product opportunities and scale benefits. We expect the OneMain Acquisition to enable us to distribute existing Springleaf products through OneMain branches and leverage key OneMain sales practices to achieve greater scale benefits in existing Springleaf branches. \nProvision for finance receivable losses increased $216 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to (i) provision for finance receivable losses of $229 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, which reflected net charge-offs of $477 million, partially offset by the re-establishment of the allowance for finance receivable losses of $248 million in 2015 and (ii) higher net charge-offs on Springleaf personal loans reflecting growth during the past 12 months. This increase was partially offset by (i) lower net charge-offs on the previously owned SpringCastle Portfolio reflecting the SpringCastle Interests Sale and the improved central servicing performance as the acquired portfolio matured under our ownership and (ii) the continued refinement of our estimates of allowance for finance receivable losses and their related assumptions based on ongoing integration and alignment of collection and charge-off practices.\nInterest expense increased $496 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to (i) interest expense of $284 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition and (ii) a change in the methodology of allocating interest expense, as described in the allocation methodologies table in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report.\nThe following table presents (i) delinquency information of the Company's segments on a Segment Accounting Basis, (a basis other than GAAP), (ii) reconciliations to our total net finance receivables on a GAAP basis, by number of days delinquent, and (iii) delinquency ratios as a percentage of net finance receivables:\nOn March 31, 2016, we sold our equity interest in the SpringCastle Joint Venture, the primary component of our Acquisitions and Servicing segment. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the SpringCastle Interests Sale.\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n \u2022 Significant expansion of our geographical presence. We believe that our expanded footprint will allow us to reach new customers for our personal finance products and further enhance our reputation in the communities we serve. \nProvision for income taxes totaled $113 million for 2016 compared to benefit from income taxes of $133 million for 2015. The effective tax rate for 2016 was 31.8% compared to 59.0% for 2015. The effective tax rate for 2016 and 2015 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of the non-controlling interest in the previously owned SpringCastle Portfolio, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes. As discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report, on March 31, 2016, the Company sold its equity interest in the SpringCastle Portfolio. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the effective rates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \u2022 Diversification of our customer base. Our branch customer base more than doubled as a result of the OneMain Acquisition and, in addition, we believe the OneMain Acquisition will enable us to extend our reach to higher credit score segments than we historically served. \nInterest expense decreased $141 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily due to the sales of the Company's beneficial interests in the mortgage-backed retained certificates during 2014.\n \u2022 Leveraging scale and cost discipline across the company to realize a total of approximately $275 million - $300 million of aggregate acquisition cost synergies. This level of cost synergies is expected to include approximately $200 million of reductions in operating expenses to be fully realized by the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as an incremental $75 million - $100 million of costs that we do not expect to incur as a result of the OneMain Acquisition; \nInterest income decreased $21 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 due to the net of the following:\n * Not applicable. \nOTHER\nincome approach, which uses prospective financial information of the reporting unit discounted at a rate that we estimate a market participant would use. For indefinite lived intangible assets, if the qualitative assessment indicates that the assets are more likely than not to have been impaired, we proceed with the fair value calculation of the assets.\n \u2022 Non-prime: FICO score of 620-659 \n\n \u2022 Reinvigorating growth in receivables at OneMain through enhanced marketing strategies and product options, including an expansion of our direct auto lending; \nNet cash used for investing activities of $2 million for 2016 was primarily due to net principal collections and originations of finance receivables held for investment and held for sale, partially offset by the SpringCastle Interests Sale, the Lendmark Sale, the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale, and the December 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale. Net cash used for investing activities of $2.6 billion for 2015 was primarily due to the OneMain Acquisition. Net cash provided by investing activities of $1.8 billion for 2014 was primarily due to the sales of real estate loans held for sale originated as held for investment during 2014, partially offset by the purchase of investment securities.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had three operating segments:\nWe execute private securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. As of December 31, 2016, our structured financings consisted of the following:\nAs a result of this sale, SpringCastle Acquisition and SpringCastle Holdings no longer hold any ownership interests of the SpringCastle Joint Venture. However, unless we are terminated, we will remain as servicer of the SpringCastle Portfolio under the servicing agreement for the SpringCastle Funding Trust.\n \u2022 obtaining new and extending existing secured revolving facilities to provide committed liquidity in case of prolonged market fluctuations. \nWe consider the following policies to be our most critical accounting policies because they involve critical accounting estimates and a significant degree of management judgment:\n (c) Other consists of: \nONEMAIN ACQUISITION\nFinancing Activities\nOther expenses decreased $12 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily due to decreased credit and collection related costs reflecting lower portfolio servicing costs due to the liquidating status of the acquired portfolio.\nOUR DEBT AGREEMENTS\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on these transactions.\nThere are many different categorizations used in the consumer lending industry to describe the creditworthiness of a borrower, including prime, non-prime, and sub-prime. While our underwriting models are not based on FICO scores, we track and analyze the performance of our finance receivable portfolio using many different parameters, including FICO scores, which is widely recognized in the consumer lending industry.\n (c) The loss ratio in 2014 reflects $2 million of recoveries on charged-off real estate loans resulting from a sale of previously charged-off real estate loans in March of 2014. Excluding these recoveries, our Real Estate loss ratio would have been 2.14% in 2014. \nAt December 31, 2016, our material contractual obligations were as follows:\nOn August 16, 2016, we liquidated our United Kingdom subsidiary, Ocean Finance and Mortgages Limited, which had previously ceased originating real estate loans in 2012. In connection with this liquidation, we recorded a net gain in other revenues of $4 million resulting from a net realized foreign currency translation gain.\nDistribution of Finance Receivables by FICO Score\nInterest expense decreased $169 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to a change in the methodology of allocating interest expense, as described in the allocation methodologies table in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report, and the reallocation of interest expense to the Consumer and Insurance segment as a result of the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale and the December 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale.\n (b) Other expenses for 2015 reflected non-cash incentive compensation relating to the rights of certain executives to receive a portion of the cash proceeds received by the Initial Stockholder. \nOur personal loan volume is generally highest during the second and fourth quarters of the year, primarily due to marketing efforts, seasonality of demand, and increased traffic in branches after the winter months. Demand for our personal loans is usually lower in January and February after the holiday season and as a result of tax refunds. Delinquencies on our personal loans are generally lowest in the first quarter and tend to rise throughout the remainder of the year. These seasonal trends contribute to fluctuations in our operating results and cash needs throughout the year.\n (b) Weighted average interest rate on Springleaf debt increased primarily due to the elimination of debt associated with our mortgage securitizations discussed above, which generally have lower interest rates. This increase was partially offset by the debt repurchases and repayments discussed above, which resulted in lower accretion of net discount, established at the date Fortress acquired a significant ownership interest in OMH, applied to long-term debt. \nWith our experienced management team, long track record of successfully accessing the capital markets, and strong demand for consumer credit, we believe we are well positioned to execute on our strategic priorities of capturing the benefits of the OneMain Acquisition and strengthening our capital base through the following key initiatives:\n \u2022 Retail Sales Finance - We ceased purchasing retail sales contracts and revolving retail accounts in January of 2013. We continue to service the liquidating retail sales contracts and will provide revolving retail sales financing services on our revolving retail accounts. We refer to retail sales contracts and revolving retail accounts collectively as retail sales finance.\u201d \n (c) Operating leases include annual rental commitments for leased office space, automobiles, and information technology and related equipment. \nDuring 2016, we (i) entered into one new conduit facility, (ii) extended the revolving periods on four existing revolving conduit facilities, (iii) amended four existing revolving conduit facilities to change the maximum principal balances, (iv) replaced the 2015 Warehouse Facility with the New Facilities and refinanced two of the New Facilities, and (v) terminated one revolving conduit facility. Net repayments under the notes of our existing revolving conduit facilities totaled $2.6 billion for 2016. The 2015 Warehouse Facility and the New Facilities are described in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report.\nOn November 15, 2015, we completed the OneMain Acquisition, the most significant transaction undertaken by the Company to date. During 2016, many significant integration milestones were achieved, involving substantial changes in operating policies and procedures in the OneMain branch network and significant personnel realignment across our OneMain and Springleaf field management teams. In the second half of 2016, we developed and implemented unified pricing, credit, and underwriting models across our branches, consolidated branch incentive and commission plans, and configured former OneMain branches into the Springleaf data network. We completed the conversion of approximately 100 of the former OneMain branches (representing approximately 10% of the former OneMain branch network's net finance receivables) to the Springleaf loan origination and servicing system. This initial conversion, as well as the re-branding of all Springleaf branches and websites under the OneMain Financial\u201d name and logo, was completed on October 1, 2016. During January and February of 2017, all of the remaining former OneMain branches, as well as our centralized servicing operations, were converted to Springleaf systems, completing the integration.\n (c) OneMain interest expense for 2015 included two months of interest expense on debt acquired in the OneMain Acquisition. See Notes 12 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on OneMain's long-term debt, consumer securitizations, and borrowing under its revolving conduit facility. \nAdjusted Pretax Earnings (Loss)\n (b) The gross charge-off ratio and net charge-off ratio in 2015 reflect $62 million of additional charge-offs recorded in December of 2015 (on a Segment Accounting Basis) related to alignment in charge-off policy for personal loans in connection with the OneMain integration. Excluding these additional charge-offs, our gross charge-off ratio and net charge-off ratio would have been 6.43% and 5.62%, respectively. \n\nOther expenses increased $268 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the following:\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n \u2022 Interest income on real estate loans held for sale decreased $39 million primarily due to lower average real estate loans held for sale during 2015. \nSegment Results\n \u2022 Consumer and Insurance; \nProvision for finance receivable losses increased $560 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to (i) provision for finance receivable losses of $512 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition and (ii) higher net charge-offs on Springleaf personal loans reflecting growth during the past 12 months. This increase was partially offset by the continued refinement of our estimates of allowance for finance receivable losses and their related assumptions based on ongoing integration and alignment of collection and charge-off practices.\n\nWith the systems conversion of the former OneMain branches having been successfully completed in the first quarter of 2017, we expect to be well positioned to resume growth in our net finance receivables beginning in the second quarter of 2017. In addition, with the successful execution of our secured lending and credit risk management strategies, we expect to experience lower future credit losses beginning in late 2017, consistent with our long-term historical experience prior to the acquisition of OneMain. No assurance can be given, however, that these actions and strategies will be effective, that we will be successful in implementing these actions and strategies, or that we will not incur increased credit losses or declines in or lower growth of our personal loan net finance receivables in the future.\nWe closely monitor the primary drivers of pretax operating income, which consist of the following:\n \u2022 Salaries and benefits increased $303 million primarily due to salaries and benefits of $317 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition. This increase was partially offset by non-cash incentive compensation expense of $15 million recorded in 2015 relating to the rights of certain executives to receive a portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of OMH's common stock by the Initial Stockholder. \nProvision for finance receivable losses increased $8 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to a higher real estate loan delinquency ratio at December 31, 2016.\nNet cash used for financing activities of $1.7 billion for 2016 was primarily due to net repayments of long-term debt. Net cash provided by financing activities of $2.0 billion for 2015 reflected the debt issuances associated with the 2015-A and 2015-B securitizations. Net cash used for financing activities of $1.8 billion for 2014 was primarily due to the repayments of the secured term loan and the 2013-BAC trust notes in late March of 2014.\n \u2022 On February 15, 2017, we exercised our right to redeem asset-backed notes issued in March 2014 by Springleaf Funding Trust 2014-A for a redemption price of $188 million. The outstanding principal balance of the asset-backed notes was $221 million on the date of the optional redemption. See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on this subsequent transaction. \n \u2022 Insurance Products - We offer our customers credit insurance (life insurance, disability insurance, and involuntary unemployment insurance) and non-credit insurance through both our combined branch network and our centralized operations. Credit insurance and non-credit insurance products are provided by the Springleaf insurance subsidiaries, Merit and Yosemite, and by the OneMain insurance subsidiaries, AHL and Triton. We also offer auto membership plans of an unaffiliated company as an ancillary product. \nInterest income increased $1.8 billion in 2016 when compared to 2015 due to the following:\nComparison of Consolidated Results for 2015 and 2014\nThe reconciliations of income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes attributable to OMH on a GAAP basis (purchase accounting) to the same amounts under a Segment Accounting Basis were as follows:\nInterest income decreased $338 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the following:\n\n \u2022 Interest income on finance receivables held for sale of $43 million in 2015 resulted from the transfer of personal loans to finance receivables held for sale on September 30, 2015. \n \u2022 Acquisitions and Servicing; and \nWe record an allowance for finance receivable losses to cover expected losses on our finance receivables. Our allowance for finance receivable losses may fluctuate based upon our continual review of the credit quality of the finance receivable portfolios and changes in economic conditions.\nHOW WE ASSESS OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE\nOther revenues increased $54 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the net of (i) two months of other revenues of $62 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, which consisted of insurance revenues of $53 million, investment revenues of $4 million, and remaining other revenue of $5 million and (ii) a decrease in Springleaf insurance revenues of $8 million primarily due to decreases in credit and non-credit earned premiums reflecting the cancellations of dwelling policies as a result of the real estate loan sales during 2014 and fewer non-credit policies written, respectively.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II - Item 8 of this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties, and assumptions. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 3 of this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed in Risk Factors\u201d in Part I - Item 1A of this report.\nKey Financial Definitions\nComparison of Consolidated Results for 2016 and 2015\n \u25e6 Average net receivables increased primarily due to (i) loans acquired in the OneMain Acquisition and (ii) the continued growth of our loan portfolio (primarily of our secured personal loans). This increase was partially offset by the transfer of $608 million of our personal loans to finance receivables held for sale on September 30, 2015. \nOn April 11, 2016, SFC issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 8.25% SFC Notes due 2020 (the 8.25% SFC Notes\u201d) under the Indenture, pursuant to which OMH provided a guarantee of the notes on a senior unsecured basis. SFC used\n \u2022 pursuing additional debt financings (including new securitizations and new unsecured debt issuances, debt refinancing transactions and standby funding facilities), or a combination of the foregoing; \nLiquidity Risks and Strategies\n (a) For purposes of our segment reporting presentation in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report, we have combined the lower of cost or fair value adjustments recorded on the date the real estate loans were transferred to finance receivables held for sale with the final gain (loss) on the sales of these loans. \nOUTLOOK\nAcquisition-related transaction and integration costs of $62 million in 2015 reflected costs relating to the OneMain Acquisition and the Lendmark Sale, including transaction costs, technology termination and certain compensation and benefit related costs.\n (a) Springleaf average net receivables decreased primarily due to (i) Springleaf liquidating real estate loan portfolio, including the transfers of real estate loans with a total carrying value of $6.7 billion to finance receivables held for sale and the subsequent sales of nearly all of these real estate loans during 2014, (ii) the transfer of $608 million of Springleaf personal loans to finance receivables held for sale on September 30, 2015, and (iii) the liquidating status of the SpringCastle Portfolio. This decrease was partially offset by (i) our continued focus on personal loan originations through our branch network and centralized operations and (ii) the launch of Springleaf direct auto loans in June of 2014. \nOther revenues increased $328 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to other revenues of $336 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, which consisted of insurance revenues of $236 million, investment revenues of $71 million, and remaining other revenues of $29 million, partially offset by a decrease in Springleaf investment revenues of $12 million during 2016 resulting from a decrease in invested assets and lower realized gains on the sale of investment securities.\n \u2022 Significant cost savings opportunities by combining complementary businesses. We expect the highly complementary nature of our two operating companies, including branch operations, to enable us to achieve significant ongoing cost savings. Expected drivers of cost savings include consolidation of branch operations, elimination of redundant centralized and corporate functions and greater efficiency of marketing programs. We expect to realize approximately $275 million - $300 million of cost synergies from the OneMain Acquisition by the end of 2017. This level of cost synergies is expected to include approximately $200 million of reductions in operating expenses to be fully realized by the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as an incremental $75 million - $100 million of costs that we do not expect to incur as a result of the OneMain Acquisition. We also anticipate incurring approximately $275 million of acquisition-related expenses to consolidate the two operating companies. As of December 31, 2016, we had incurred approximately $170 million of acquisition-related transaction and integration expenses ($108 million incurred during 2016). \n \u2022 Finance charges decreased $299 million primarily due to the net of the following: \nOther revenues increased $344 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to (i) other revenues of $319 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, which consisted of insurance revenues of $236 million, investment revenues of $54 million, and remaining other revenues of $29 million, including $25 million of revenues from our ancillary products, (ii) servicing charge income for the SpringCastle Portfolio of $33 million in 2016, (iii) net gain on sales of personal and real estate loans of $18 million in 2016, (iv) servicing charge income for the receivables related to the Lendmark Sale of $6 million in 2016, and (v) foreign currency translation adjustment gain of $4 million in 2016 resulting from the liquidation of our United Kingdom subsidiary. This increase was partially offset by (i) a decrease in Springleaf investment revenues of $20 million during 2016 primarily due to a decrease in invested assets and lower realized gains on the sale of investment securities and (ii) net loss on repurchases and repayments of debt of $17 million in 2016.\nOn December 19, 2016, SFC and certain of its subsidiaries sold a portfolio of first and second lien mortgage loans for aggregate cash proceeds of $58 million (the December 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale\u201d) and recorded a net loss in other revenues at the time of sale of less than $1 million.\n\nREAL ESTATE LOAN SALES\nWhen we modify a loan's contractual terms for economic or other reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties and grant a concession that we would not otherwise consider, we classify that loan as a TDR finance receivable. When we modify an account we primarily use a combination of the following to reduce the borrower's monthly payment: reduce interest rate, extend the term, capitalize or forgive past due interest and, to a lesser extent, forgive principal. Account modifications that are deemed to be a TDR finance receivable are measured for impairment in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the accounting for impaired loans.\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the OneMain Acquisition.\n \u25e6 Average net receivables decreased primarily due to our liquidating real estate loan portfolio, including the transfers of $266 million and $49 million of real estate loans to finance receivables held for sale on June 30, 2016 and November 30, 2016, respectively. \nCONSUMER AND INSURANCE\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $579 million of cash and cash equivalents, and during 2016, we generated net income attributable to OMH of $215 million. Our net cash inflow from operating and investing activities totaled $1.3 billion in 2016. At December 31, 2016, our scheduled principal and interest payments for 2017 on our existing debt (excluding securitizations) totaled $1.7 billion. As of December 31, 2016, we had $4.0 billion UPB of unencumbered personal loans and $368 million UPB of unencumbered real estate loans (including $216 million held for sale).\nFollowing the OneMain Acquisition, we include OneMain's operations within the Consumer and Insurance segment. See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for more information about our segments.\nUSES OF FUNDS\n\nProvision for finance receivable losses decreased $37 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily due to lower net charge-offs on the SpringCastle Portfolio reflecting improvements in servicing of the acquired portfolio and its liquidating status.\n \u25e6 Yield increased primarily due to a higher proportion of our remaining real estate loans during 2015 that were secured by second mortgages, which generally have higher yields. \n (d) Other consists of the elimination of allowance for finance receivable losses due to the transfer of real estate loans held for investment to finance receivable held for sale during 2014. \n (a) Average net receivables increased primarily due to (i) loans acquired in the OneMain Acquisition and (ii) the continued growth of our loan portfolio (primarily of our secured personal loans). This increase was partially offset by (i) the SpringCastle Interests Sale, (ii) the transfer of $608 million of our personal loans to finance receivables held for sale on September 30, 2015, and (iii) our liquidating real estate loan portfolio, including the transfers of $257 million and $50 million of real estate loans to finance receivables held for sale on June 30, 2016 and November 30, 2016, respectively. \n \u2022 Insurance policy benefits and claims increased $21 million due to two months of insurance policy benefits and claims of $24 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, partially offset by a $3 million decrease in Springleaf insurance policy benefits and claims during 2015 primarily due to favorable variances in benefit reserves. \n \u2022 Sub-prime: FICO score of 619 or below \n \u25e6 Yield decreased primarily due to the continued growth of secured personal loans, which generally have lower yields relative to our unsecured personal loans. \nWe estimate the allowance for finance receivable losses primarily on historical loss experience using a roll rate-based model applied to our finance receivable portfolios. In our roll rate-based model, our finance receivable types are stratified by delinquency stages (i.e., current, 1-29 days past due, 30-59 days past due, etc.) and projected forward in one-month increments using historical roll rates. In each month of the simulation, losses on our finance receivable types are captured, and the ending delinquency stratification serves as the beginning point of the next iteration. No new volume is assumed. This process is repeated until the number of iterations equals the loss emergence period (the interval of time between the event which causes a borrower to default on a finance receivable and our recording of the charge-off) for our finance receivable types.\nWe consider the delinquency status of our finance receivable as the primary indicator of credit quality. We monitor delinquency trends to evaluate the risk of future credit losses and employ advanced analytical tools to manage our exposure and appetite. Our branch team members work with customers through occasional periods of financial difficulty and offer a variety of borrower assistance programs to help customers continue to make payments. Team members also actively engage in collection activities throughout the early stages of delinquency. We closely track and report the percentage of receivables that are 30-89 days past due as a benchmark of portfolio quality, collections effectiveness, and as a strong indicator of losses in coming quarters.\n \u25e6 Average net receivables decreased primarily due to the continued liquidation of the real estate loan portfolio, including the transfers of real estate loans with a total carrying value of $7.2 billion to finance receivables held for sale and the subsequent sales of nearly all of these real estate loans during 2014. \nACQUISITIONS AND SERVICING\n \u2022 Maintaining a strong liquidity level and diversified funding sources. \nDELINQUENCY\n \u2022 Insurance policy benefits and claims increased $16 million due to two months of insurance policy benefits and claims of $19 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in Springleaf insurance policy benefits and claims of $3 million primarily due to favorable variances in benefit reserves. \n \u2022 Reducing leverage; and \nInterest income increased in 2016 when compared to 2015 due to the net of the following:\n \u2022 the addition to allowance for finance receivable losses of $666 million due to the personal loans acquired in connection with the OneMain Acquisition and the offsetting Segment to GAAP adjustment; and \n (b) Not applicable. \nInvesting Activities\nOn November 15, 2015, we completed the OneMain Acquisition. The results of OneMain are included in our consolidated operating results and selected financial statistics from November 1, 2015 in the table below. A further discussion of our operating results for each of our operating segments is provided under Segment Results\u201d below.\nREAL ESTATE\nResults of Operations\n \u2022 SpringCastle Interests Sale; \nALLOWANCE FOR FINANCE RECEIVABLE LOSSES\nThe debt agreements to which SFC, OMFH, and their subsidiaries are a party include customary terms and conditions, including covenants and representations and warranties. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the restrictive covenants under SFC's and OMFH's debt agreements, as well as the guarantees of SFC's and OMFH's long-term debt.\nSOURCES OF FUNDS\nThe following table presents the composition of our finance receivables for each of the Company's segments on a Segment Accounting Basis (a basis other than GAAP), as well as reconciliations to our total net finance receivables on a GAAP basis:\nOther expenses decreased $46 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the following:\nInterest expense increased in 2016 when compared to 2015 due to the net of the following:\n (a) See Key Financial Definitions\u201d at the end of our management's discussion and analysis for formulas and definitions of key performance ratios. \n \u2022 Other operating expenses decreased $25 million primarily resulting from the sales of real estate loans during 2014 and the redistribution of the allocation of other operating expenses as a result of the real estate loan sales in 2014. \n \u2022 Real Estate Loans - We ceased real estate lending in January of 2012, and during 2014, we sold $6.4 billion real estate loans held for sale. In connection with the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale and the December 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale (as discussed and defined in Recent Developments and Outlook\u201d below), we sold $308 million real estate loans held for sale. The remaining real estate loans may be closed-end accounts or open-end home equity lines of credit, generally have a fixed rate and maximum original terms of 360 months, and are secured by first or second mortgages on residential real estate. Predominantly, our first lien mortgages are serviced by third-party servicers, and we continue to provide servicing for our second lien mortgages (home equity lines of credit). At December 31, 2016, we had $144 million of real estate loans held for investment, of which 93% were secured by first mortgages, compared to $538 million at December 31, 2015, of which 38% were secured by first mortgages. Real estate loans held for sale totaled $153 million and $176 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nAdjusted pretax operating results and selected financial statistics for Consumer and Insurance (which are reported on an adjusted Segment Accounting Basis) were as follows:\n \u2022 Finance charges increased $523 million due to (i) two months of finance charges of $355 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition and (ii) an increase in Springleaf finance charges of $168 million primarily due to higher average net receivables, partially offset by lower yield. Average net receivables increased primarily due to our continued focus on personal loans, including the launch of Springleaf direct auto loans in June of 2014. Yield decreased primarily due to the higher proportion of Springleaf direct auto loans, which generally have lower yields. \n\n \u2022 Insurance policy benefits and claims increased $70 million primarily due to insurance policy benefits and claims of $87 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition. This increase was partially offset by a $17 million decrease in Springleaf insurance policy benefits and claims during 2016 primarily due to favorable variances in benefit reserves, which partially resulted from a $9 million write-down of benefit reserves recorded during 2016. \n \u2022 Lendmark Sale; \nSee Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for (i) a description of our segments, (ii) reconciliations of segment totals to consolidated financial statement amounts, (iii) methodologies used to allocate revenues and expenses to each segment, and (iv) further discussion of the differences in our Segment Accounting Basis and GAAP.\nOther\u201d consists of our other non-originating legacy operations, which are isolated by geographic market and/or distribution channel from our three segments. These operations include: (i) Springleaf legacy operations in 14 states where we had also ceased branch-based personal lending during 2012; (ii) Springleaf liquidating retail sales finance portfolio (including retail sales finance accounts from its legacy auto finance operation); (iii) Springleaf lending operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands; and (iv) the operations of Springleaf United Kingdom subsidiary prior to its liquidation on August 16, 2016.\na portion of the proceeds from the offering to repurchase approximately $600 million aggregate principal amount of its existing senior notes that mature in 2017 and the remainder for general corporate purposes. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on this offering.\nOther expenses increased $695 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 due to the following:\nThe reconciliations of income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes attributable to OMH on a Segment Accounting Basis to adjusted pretax earnings (loss) (non-GAAP) by segment were as follows:\nTDR FINANCE RECEIVABLES\nHowever, it is possible that the actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or that one or more of our significant judgments or estimates could prove to be materially incorrect.\nOUR SEGMENTS\nOn November 15, 2015, we completed our acquisition of OneMain. The OneMain Acquisition brings together two branch-based consumer finance companies with complementary strategies and locations, focused on the non-prime market in the United States.\nChanges in the allowance for finance receivable losses for each of the Company's segments on a Segment Accounting Basis, (a basis other than GAAP), as well as reconciliations to our total allowance for finance receivable losses on a GAAP basis, were as follows:\nThe delinquency status of our finance receivable portfolio, along with the level of our troubled debt restructured ( TDR\u201d) finance receivables, are the primary drivers that can cause fluctuations in our allowance for finance receivable losses from period to period. We monitor the allowance ratio to ensure we have a sufficient level of allowance for finance receivable losses to cover estimated incurred losses in our finance receivable portfolio.\n\n\nManagement exercises its judgment, based on quantitative analyses, qualitative factors, such as recent delinquency and other credit trends, and experience in the consumer finance industry, when determining the amount of the allowance for finance receivable losses. We adjust the amounts determined by the roll rate-based model for management's estimate of the effects of model imprecision which include but are not limited to, any changes to underwriting criteria, portfolio seasoning, and current economic conditions, including levels of unemployment and personal bankruptcies.\nOn March 31, 2016, Springleaf Finance, Inc., SpringCastle Holdings, LLC ( SpringCastle Holdings\u201d) and Springleaf Acquisition Corporation ( Springleaf Acquisition\u201d and, together with SpringCastle Holdings, the SpringCastle Sellers\u201d), wholly owned subsidiaries of OMH, entered into a purchase agreement with certain subsidiaries of New Residential Investment Corp. ( NRZ\u201d and such subsidiaries, the NRZ Buyers\u201d) and BTO Willow Holdings II, L.P. and Blackstone Family Tactical Opportunities Investment Partnership-NQ-ESC L.P. (collectively, the Blackstone Buyers\u201d and together with the NRZ Buyers, the SpringCastle Buyers\u201d). Pursuant to the purchase agreement, on March 31, 2016, SpringCastle Holdings sold its 47% limited liability company interest in each of SpringCastle America, LLC, SpringCastle Credit, LLC and SpringCastle Finance, LLC, and Springleaf Acquisition sold its 47% limited liability company interest in SpringCastle Acquisition LLC, to the SpringCastle Buyers for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $112 million (the SpringCastle Interests Sale\u201d). SpringCastle America, LLC, SpringCastle Credit, LLC, SpringCastle Finance, LLC and SpringCastle Acquisition LLC are collectively referred to herein as the SpringCastle Joint Venture.\u201d\nWe report the operating results of Consumer and Insurance, Acquisitions and Servicing, Real Estate, and Other using the Segment Accounting Basis, which (i) reflects our allocation methodologies for certain costs, primarily interest expense, loan loss reserves and acquisition costs to reflect the manner in which we assess our business results and (ii) excludes the impact of applying purchase accounting (eliminates premiums/discounts on our finance receivables and long-term debt at acquisition, as well as the amortization/accretion in future periods). These allocations and adjustments currently have a material effect on our reported segment basis income as compared to GAAP. See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for a complete discussion of our segment accounting. We believe the Segment Accounting Basis (a basis other than GAAP) provides investors a consistent basis on which management evaluates segment performance.\nIn addition to cash received from our senior notes offering and securitization transactions, our sources of funds were favorably impacted by the following transactions:\nComparison of Adjusted Pretax Operating Results for 2016 and 2015\n\nOther Transactions\nInformation regarding TDR finance receivables held for investment for each of the Company's segments on a Segment Accounting Basis, (a basis other than GAAP), as well as reconciliations to information regarding our total TDR finance receivables held for investment on a GAAP basis, were as follows:\nInterest income decreased $82 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily due to lower average net receivables reflecting the liquidating status of the SpringCastle Portfolio.\nThe estimated synergies were derived by comparing the operating expenses expected in the second half of 2017 of the combined operations to the sum of operating expenses expected to be generated on a stand-alone basis, as if each company had the same business strategies. The foregoing estimates of synergies and charges in connection with consolidating the two companies and expectations regarding when they will be fully reflected in our results are subject to various risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Therefore, no assurance can be given as to when or if they will be realized. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 3 of this report.\n (b) Springleaf yield increased primarily due to a higher proportion of Springleaf personal loans, which have higher yields, as a result of the real estate loan sales during 2014. The increase in yield was partially offset by the launch of our direct auto loans in June of 2014, which generally has lower yields. \n \u2022 the elimination of allowance for finance receivable losses due to the transfers of real estate loans held for investment to finance receivable held for sale during 2016. \nAcquisition-related transaction and integration costs of $108 million and $62 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, reflected increased costs relating to the OneMain Acquisition and the Lendmark Sale, including branch and system conversions, information technology costs, certain compensation and benefit related costs, and other costs and fees that would not have been incurred in the ordinary course of business. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for further information regarding these costs.\n (a) Interest expense for 2016 when compared to 2015 reflected a change in the methodology of allocating interest expense, as described in the allocation methodologies table in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report. \n (a) Springleaf average debt decreased primarily due to debt repurchases and repayments of $2.0 billion during 2015 and the elimination of $3.5 billion of debt associated with our mortgage securitizations. These decreases were partially offset by net debt issuances pursuant to SFC's consumer securitization transactions completed during 2015 and additional borrowings under its conduit facilities. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on SFC's consumer loan securitization transactions and borrowings under its conduit facilities. \nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nStructured Financings\nWe finance the majority of our operating liquidity and capital needs through a combination of cash flows from operations, securitization debt, borrowings from conduit facilities, unsecured debt and equity, and may also utilize other corporate debt facilities in the future. As a holding company, all of the funds generated from our operations are earned by our operating subsidiaries.\n\n (a) See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the components of our GAAP to Segment Accounting Basis adjustments. \nWe also report selected financial statistics relating to the net finance receivables and credit quality of Consumer and Insurance, Acquisitions and Servicing, Real Estate, and Other using a Segment Accounting Basis.\n (c) Not applicable. \nComparison of Adjusted Pretax Operating Results for 2015 and 2014\n (b) See Key Financial Definitions\u201d at the end of our management's discussion and analysis for formulas and definitions of key performance ratios. \nWe group FICO scores into the following credit strength categories:\nThere are numerous risks to our financial results, liquidity, capital raising, and debt refinancing plans, some of which may not be quantified in our current liquidity forecasts. These risks include, but are not limited, to the following:\n \u2022 December 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale. \nAssuming the U.S. economy continues to experience slow to moderate growth, we expect to continue our long history of strong credit performance and believe the strong credit quality of our loan portfolio will continue as the result of our disciplined underwriting practices and ongoing collection efforts. We have continued to see some migration of customer activity away from traditional channels, such as direct mail, to online channels (primarily serviced through our combined branch network), where we believe we are well suited to capture volume due to our scale, technology, and deployment of advanced analytics.\nDuring 2016, the allowance for finance receivables for our consumer and insurance segment decreased $37 million, while the 60+ days delinquency ratio increased 40 basis points to 3.59% at December 31, 2016. The required allowance increase resulting from the higher delinquency ratio was more than offset by a decline of $81 million in our TDR finance receivables and a corresponding decline of $83 million in the allowance for TDR finance receivable losses during 2016.\nOn August 3, 2016, SFC and certain of its subsidiaries sold a portfolio of second lien mortgage loans for aggregate cash proceeds of $246 million (the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale\u201d) and recorded a net loss in other revenues at the time of sale of $4 million. The proceeds from this sale, together with cash on hand, were used to pay off $375 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes that matured in the third quarter of 2016. Unless we are terminated or we resign as servicer, we will continue to service the loans included in this sale pursuant to a servicing agreement.

Our overall funding costs are positively impacted by our increased usage of securitizations, as we typically execute these transactions at interest rates significantly below those of our unsecured debt.\nOur products also included the SpringCastle Portfolio at December 31, 2015, as described below:\n \u2022 the potential for disruptions in the debt and equity markets. \naggregate cash purchase price of $624 million.

We employ widely used financial techniques or utilize third-party valuation service providers to gather, analyze, and interpret market information and derive fair values based upon relevant methodologies and assumptions for individual instruments or pools of finance receivables. When our valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security, we determine fair value either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a quote, which is generally non-binding, or by employing widely used financial techniques.\nFor goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, we first complete a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test annually as of October 1 of each year. For goodwill, if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, we proceed with the two-step impairment test. When necessary, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated utilizing the\nFor those net intangible assets with a finite useful life, we review such intangibles for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nThe allowance for finance receivable losses related to our TDR finance receivables represents loan-specific reserves based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows. We establish our allowance for finance receivable losses related to our TDR finance receivables by calculating the present value (discounted at the loan's effective interest rate prior to modification) of all expected cash flows less the recorded investment in the aggregated pool. We use certain assumptions to estimate the expected cash flows from our TDR finance receivables. The primary assumptions for our model are prepayment speeds, default rates, and severity rates.\nALLOWANCE FOR FINANCE RECEIVABLE LOSSES\n \u2022 Growing secured lending originations at OneMain with a goal of enhancing credit performance; \n\nAdjusted pretax operating results and selected financial statistics for Acquisitions and Servicing (which are reported on an adjusted Segment Accounting Basis) were as follows:\nNet cash provided by operations of $1.3 billion for 2016 reflected net income of $243 million, the impact of non-cash items, and an unfavorable change in working capital of $115 million. Net cash provided by operations of $735 million for 2015 reflected a net loss of $93 million, the impact of non-cash items, and a favorable change in working capital of $97 million. Net cash provided by operations of $381 million for 2014 reflected net income of $589 million, the impact of non-cash items, and an unfavorable change in working capital of $107 million primarily due to costs relating to the real estate sales transactions.\nAdjusted pretax operating results of the Other components (which are reported on an adjusted Segment Accounting Basis) were as follows:\nOur non-originating legacy products include:\nTax Reform Proposals\nIn addition to the structured financings included in the table above, we had access to 11 conduit facilities with a total borrowing capacity of $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2016, as discussed in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report. At December 31, 2016, no amounts were drawn under these facilities.\nAdjusted pretax operating results and selected financial statistics for Real Estate (which are reported on an adjusted Segment Accounting Basis) were as follows:\nSFC's and OMFH's credit ratings are non-investment grade, which have a significant impact on our cost of, and access to, capital. This, in turn, can negatively affect our ability to manage our liquidity and our ability or cost to refinance our indebtedness.\nBased on our estimates and taking into account the risks and uncertainties of our plans, we believe that we will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate our businesses and repay our obligations as they become due for at least the next 12 months.\n\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe make modifications to our finance receivables to assist borrowers during times of financial difficulties. When we modify a loan's contractual terms for economic or other reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties and grant a concession that we would not otherwise consider, we classify that loan as a TDR finance receivable.\nSeasonality\nOperating Activities\n\n (b) Represents UPB of the collateral supporting the issued and retained notes. \nThe credit quality of our loans is driven by our long-standing underwriting philosophy, which takes into account the prospective customer's household budget, and his or her willingness and capacity to repay the proposed loan. The profitability of our loan portfolio is directly connected to net credit losses; therefore, we closely analyze credit performance. We also monitor recovery rates because of their contribution to the reduction in the severity of our charge-offs. Additionally, because delinquencies are an early indicator of future net credit losses, we analyze delinquency trends, adjusting for seasonality, to determine whether or not our loans are performing in line with our original estimates.\nOperating Expenses", "item_7_text": " \u2022 Salaries and benefits increased $324 million primarily due to (i) salaries and benefits of $316 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition and (ii) an increase in Springleaf average staffing during 2016 prior to the Lendmark Sale. \nComparison of Adjusted Pretax Operating Results for 2015 and 2014\n \u2022 our inability to grow or maintain our personal loan portfolio with adequate profitability; \n (a) Average debt increased primarily due to (i) debt acquired in the OneMain Acquisition and (ii) net unsecured debt issued during the past 12 months. This increase was partially offset by (i) the elimination of the debt associated with the SpringCastle Interests Sale and (ii) net repayments under our conduit facilities. See Notes 12 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on our long-term debt, consumer loan securitization transactions, and our conduit facilities. \nOther revenues decreased $484 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the net of (i) transactions that occurred in 2014 including net gain on sales of real estate loans and related trust assets of $648 million, net loss on repurchases and repayments of debt of $66 million, and net loss on fair value adjustments on debt of $15 million, (ii) two months of other revenues of $59 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, which consisted of insurance revenues of $53 million, investment revenues of $1 million, and remaining other revenue of $5 million, (iii) net increase in revenues associated with the 2014 real estate loans sales of $4 million (higher investment revenue generated from investing the proceeds of the sales, partially offset by lower insurance revenue reflecting the cancellations of dwelling policies as a result of the sales), and (iv) increase in remaining other revenue of $20 million primarily due to lower net charge-offs recognized on finance receivables held for sale and provision adjustments for liquidated held for sale accounts during 2015.\n\n \u25e6 Yield decreased primarily due to the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale and December 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale of second lien mortgage loans, which generally had higher yields relative to our remaining real estate loans. \nWe also continued to execute our strategy to increase the proportion of our loan originations secured by auto collateral (which typically have lower yields and credit losses relative to unsecured personal loans), particularly within the former OneMain\n\nWe have previously purchased portions of our unsecured indebtedness, and we may elect to purchase additional portions of our unsecured indebtedness in the future.

Our customers' demographics are in many respects near the national median, but may vary from national norms in terms of credit and repayment histories. Many of our customers have experienced some level of prior financial difficulty or have limited credit experience and require higher levels of servicing and support from our branch network.\nOUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES\nAs part of our initiative to close the OneMain Acquisition, on November 13, 2015, OMH and certain of its subsidiaries (the Branch Sellers\u201d) entered into an Asset Preservation Stipulation and Order and agreed to a Proposed Final Judgment (collectively, the Settlement Agreement\u201d) with the DOJ, as well as certain state attorneys general, to resolve any inquiries of the DOJ and such state attorneys general with respect to the OneMain Acquisition. Pursuant to this agreement, OMH agreed to divest 127 Springleaf branches across 11 states as a condition for approval of the OneMain Acquisition.\nNet gain on sale of SpringCastle interests of $167 million in 2016 reflected the net gain associated with the sale of our equity interest in the SpringCastle Joint Venture on March 31, 2016. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the sale.\nOn November 15, 2015, we completed our acquisition of OneMain from Citigroup. The OneMain Acquisition has brought together two branch-based consumer finance companies with complementary strategies and locations. Together, we provide personal loans primarily to non-prime customers through our combined network of over 1,800 branch offices in 44 states as of December 31, 2016 and on a centralized basis as part of our centralized operations and our digital platform (our online consumer loan origination business). We also write credit and non-credit insurance covering our customers. In addition, we service loans owned by us and service or subservice loans owned by third parties.\nPURCHASED CREDIT IMPAIRED FINANCE RECEIVABLES\n \u2022 Interest income on real estate loans held for sale increased $3 million primarily due to the transfers of $315 million of real estate loans to finance receivables held for sale during 2016, which were sold in August and December of 2016. \nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nBecause loan volume and portfolio size determine the magnitude of the impact of each of the above factors on our earnings, we also closely monitor origination volume and annual percentage rate.\nManagement uses adjusted pretax earnings (loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a key performance measure of our segments. Adjusted pretax earnings (loss) represents income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes on a Segment Accounting Basis and excludes acquisition-related transaction and integration expenses, net gain (loss) on sales of personal and real estate loans, net gain on sale of SpringCastle interests, SpringCastle transaction costs, losses resulting from repurchases and repayments of debt (attributable to OMH), gains on fair value adjustments on debt (attributable to OMH), restructuring and transaction costs, debt refinance costs, and net loss on liquidation of our United Kingdom subsidiary. Management believes adjusted pretax earnings (loss) is useful in assessing the profitability of our segments and uses adjusted pretax earnings (loss) in evaluating our operating performance. Adjusted pretax earnings (loss) is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered supplemental to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes, net income, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n (a) Includes personal loans held for sale, but excludes real estate loans held for sale in order to be comparable with our segment statistics disclosed in Segment Results.\u201d \nOur net finance receivables grouped into the following categories based solely on borrower FICO credit scores at the purchase, origination, renewal, or most recently refreshed date were as follows:\nWhen finance receivables are 60 days past due, we consider them delinquent and transfer collections management of these accounts to our centralized operations, as these accounts are considered to be at increased risk for loss. Use of our centralized operations teams for managing late stage delinquency allows us to apply more advanced collections technologies/tools and drives operating efficiencies in servicing. At 90 days past due, we consider our finance receivables to be nonperforming.\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources - Sources of Funds - Securitizations and Borrowings from Revolving Conduit Facilities\u201d above for information on the securitization and conduit transactions completed subsequent to December 31, 2016.\nInterest income increased $566 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the following:\nProvision for finance receivable losses increased $293 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily due to (i) two months of net charge-offs and allowance requirements totaling $372 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition and (ii) higher net charge-offs on Springleaf personal loans reflecting growth during 2015 and a higher Springleaf personal loan delinquency ratio in 2015. Since we acquired the OneMain personal loans at a premium, an allowance was recorded to reflect the losses inherent in the portfolio over the loss emergence period. Additionally, the allowance for finance receivable losses as a percentage of finance receivables for the acquired personal loans was expected to be higher, as the majority of these loans were unsecured. This increase was partially offset by (i) lower net charge-offs on the SpringCastle Portfolio reflecting the improved central servicing performance as the acquired portfolio matured under our ownership and (ii) lower net charge-offs and allowance requirements on our real estate loans reflecting the 2014 transfer of real estate loans previously discussed.\nunsecured loans and loans secured by subordinate residential real estate mortgages and include both closed-end accounts and open-end lines of credit. These loans were in a liquidating status and varied in substance and form from our originated loans. Unless we are terminated, we will continue to provide the servicing for these loans pursuant to a servicing agreement, which we service as unsecured loans due to the fact that the liens are subordinated to superior ranking security interests.\nLIQUIDITY\n \u2022 Salaries and benefits increased $142 million primarily due to (i) two months of salaries and benefits of $72 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition and (ii) an increase in Springleaf salaries and benefits of $70 million primarily due to higher variable compensation reflecting increased originations of personal loans, increased staffing in Springleaf centralized operations, and the redistribution of the allocation of salaries and benefit expenses as a result of the real estate loan sales in 2014. \nSecuritizations and Borrowings from Revolving Conduit Facilities\nProvision for finance receivable losses increased $149 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to (i) two months of net charge-offs and allowance requirements totaling $92 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition and (ii) an increase in Springleaf provision for finance receivable losses of $57 million primarily due to growth during 2015 and a higher Springleaf personal loan delinquency ratio at December 31, 2015.\nWe believe the OneMain Acquisition will result in a number of strategic benefits and opportunities, including:\n \u2022 maintaining disciplined underwriting standards and pricing for loans we originate or purchase and managing purchases of finance receivables; \nThe new presidential administration and several members of the U.S. Congress have indicated significant reform of various aspects of the U.S. tax code as a top legislative priority. A number of proposals for tax reform, including significant changes to corporate tax provisions, are currently under consideration. Such changes could have a material impact, either positive or negative, on our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, depending on the nature and extent of any changes to the U.S. tax code that are ultimately enacted into law. Additionally, changes to the U.S. tax code could more broadly impact the U.S. economy, which could potentially result in a material impact, either positive or negative, on the demand for our products and services and the ability of our customers to repay their loans. We cannot predict if or when any of these proposals to reform the U.S. tax code will be enacted into law and, accordingly, no assurance can be given as to whether or to what extent any changes to the U.S. tax code will impact us or our customers or our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nComparison of Adjusted Pretax Operating Results for 2015 and 2014\nWe track the spread between the interest income earned on our finance receivables and the interest expense incurred on our debt, and continually monitor the components of our yield and our cost of funds.\nAs part of each of our acquisitions, we identify a population of finance receivables for which it is determined that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. We accrete the excess of the cash flows expected to be collected on the purchased credit impaired finance receivables over the discounted cash flows (the accretable yield\u201d) into interest income at a level rate of return over the expected lives of the underlying pools of the purchased credit impaired finance receivables. We update our estimates for cash flows on a quarterly basis incorporating current assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. If expected cash flows increase significantly, we adjust the yield prospectively; conversely, if expected cash flows decrease, we record an impairment.\n\nInterest expense for 2015 when compared to 2014 reflected higher interest expense on unsecured debt, which was allocated based on a higher cash balance held in anticipation of the OneMain Acquisition.\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for more information about the changes in the allowance for finance receivable losses.\n \u2022 potential liability relating to real estate and personal loans which we have sold or may sell in the future, or relating to securitized loans; and \nOUR PRODUCTS\nDuring 2016, we (i) completed four consumer loan securitizations and one auto securitization, (ii) exercised our right to redeem the asset backed notes issued by the Springleaf Funding Trust 2013-B, and (iii) deconsolidated the previously issued securitized interests of the SpringCastle Funding Asset-backed Notes 2014-A. See Structured Financings\u201d later in this section for further information on each of our securitization transactions.\nOther revenues decreased $19 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to (i) impairments of $10 million recognized on our real estate loans held for sale during 2016 and (ii) a decrease in investment revenues during 2016, as the prior period reflected higher investment income generated from investing the proceeds of the 2014 real estate loan sales.\n (a) Other consists of: \n \u2022 Personal Loans - We offer personal loans through our combined branch network and over the Internet through our centralized operations to customers who generally need timely access to cash. Our personal loans are typically non-revolving with a fixed-rate and a fixed, original term of three to six years and are secured by consumer goods, automobiles, or other personal property or are unsecured. At December 31, 2016, we had over 2.2 million personal loans, representing $13.6 billion of net finance receivables, of which 43% were secured by collateral, compared to 2.2 million personal loans totaling $13.3 billion at December 31, 2015, of which 27% were secured by collateral. Personal loans held for sale totaled $617 million at December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Other operating expenses increased $110 million primarily due to two months of other operating expenses of $63 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition and an increase in Springleaf other operating expenses of $47 million primarily due to (i) an increase in advertising expenses of $22 million, (ii) an increase in information technology expenses of $6 million reflecting increased depreciation and software maintenance as a result of software purchases and the capitalization of internally developed software, (iii) an increase in occupancy costs of $6 million resulting from increased general maintenance costs of our branches and higher leasehold improvement amortization expense from the servicing facilities added in 2014, (iv) an increase in professional fees of $5 million relating to legal and audit services, (v) an increase in credit and collection related costs of $4 million reflecting growth in personal loans, including our direct auto loans, and (vi) the redistribution of the allocation of other operating expenses as a result of the real estate loan sales in 2014. \n (c) OneMain finance charges for 2015 included two months of finance charges, net of a purchase accounting adjustment of $102 million primarily due to accretion of premium on OneMain personal loans, as a result of the OneMain Acquisition. \nProvision for finance receivable losses decreased $130 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to (i) the transfers of real estate loans with a total carrying value of $7.2 billion to finance receivables held for sale and the subsequent sales of nearly all of these real estate loans during 2014 and (ii) a lower real estate loan delinquency ratio at December 31, 2015.\n (b) Yield decreased primarily due to (i) the continued growth of secured personal loans, which generally have lower yields relative to our unsecured personal loans, and (ii) the effects of purchase accounting adjustments relating to the OneMain Acquisition. \nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that limit their ability to pay dividends. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on these restrictions and the dividends paid by our insurance subsidiaries during 2014 through 2016.\nFINANCE RECEIVABLE COMPOSITION\nOur operating subsidiaries' primary cash needs relate to funding our lending activities, our debt service obligations, our operating expenses (including acquisition-related transaction and integration expenses), payment of insurance claims and, to a lesser extent, expenditures relating to upgrading and monitoring our technology platform, risk systems, and branch locations.\nInterest expense decreased in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the net of the following:\nCredit Quality\n (b) Purchase accounting was not elected at the segment level. \nSPRINGCASTLE INTERESTS SALE\nContractual Obligations\nbranches where secured loan originations have historically represented a smaller proportion of total originations than those of the former Springleaf branches. While we have been able to increase secured loan originations at former OneMain branches in recent quarters, not every unsecured loan customer has the collateral or the willingness to take on a secured loan, and we believe this has contributed to slower growth in personal loan net finance receivables than anticipated. As we continue to increase secured loans as a proportion of our total loan portfolio, our yields may be lower in future periods relative to our historical yields; however, we also expect a proportional improvement in net credit losses as secured loans become a greater proportion of our total loan portfolio.\n \u2022 August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale; and \n\n \u2022 Other operating expenses increased $332 million primarily due to (i) other operating expenses of $306 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, which consisted primarily of advertising expenses of $74 million, occupancy costs of $66 million, amortization on other intangible assets of $57 million, and information technology expenses of $53 million, (ii) a decrease in Springleaf deferred origination costs of $12 million during 2016, and (iii) an increase in Springleaf information technology expenses of $12 million during 2016. \n \u2022 Insurance policy benefits and claims increased $71 million due to insurance policy benefits and claims of $88 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition. This increase was partially offset by a $17 million decrease in Springleaf insurance policy benefits and claims during 2016 primarily due to favorable variances in benefit reserves, which partially resulted from a $9 million write-down of benefit reserves recorded during 2016. \nOther expenses increased $224 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the net of the following:\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by SEC rules. We had no off-balance sheet exposure to losses associated with unconsolidated variable interest entities at December 31, 2016 or 2015, other than certain representations and warranties associated with the sales of the mortgage-backed retained certificates during 2014. As of December 31, 2016, we had no repurchase activity related to these sales.\nOn November 12, 2015, the Branch Sellers entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Lendmark to sell 127 Springleaf branches and, subject to certain exclusions, the associated personal loans issued to customers of such branches, fixed non-information technology assets and certain other tangible personal property located in such branches to Lendmark (the Lendmark Sale\u201d). On May 2, 2016, the Branch Sellers completed the sale of 127 Springleaf branches to Lendmark for an\nOther revenues increased $20 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily due to (i) lower net charge-offs recognized on real estate finance receivables held for sale and provision adjustments for liquidated real estate held for sale accounts during 2015 and (ii) investment income generated in 2015 from investing the proceeds of the real estate loan sales during 2014.\nThe principal factors that could decrease our liquidity are customer delinquencies and defaults, a decline in customer prepayments, a prolonged inability to adequately access capital market funding, and unanticipated expenditures in connection with the integration of OneMain. We intend to support our liquidity position by utilizing some or all the following strategies:\n (b) Weighted average interest rate on our debt decreased primarily due to (i) debt acquired from the OneMain Acquisition, which generally has a lower weighted average interest rate relative to SFC's weighted average interest rate, and (ii) the repurchase of $600 million unsecured notes, which had a higher interest rate relative to our other indebtedness, in connection with SFC's offering of the 8.25% SFC Notes, as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Part II - Item 7 of this report. The decrease was partially offset by (i) SFC's offering of the 8.25% SFC Notes in April of 2016 and (ii) the elimination of debt associated with the SpringCastle Interests Sale, which generally had a lower interest rate relative to our other indebtedness. \n \u2022 Salaries and benefits increased $125 million primarily due to (i) two months of salaries and benefits of $71 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, (ii) increased staffing in Springleaf centralized operations, and (iii) non-cash incentive compensation expense of $15 million recorded in 2015 relating to the rights of certain executives to receive a portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of OMH's common stock by the Initial Stockholder. \nAn index to our management's discussion and analysis follows:\nSee Notes 12 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on our long-term debt, consumer loan securitization transactions and conduit facilities.\n (a) On-balance sheet securitizations and borrowings under revolving conduit facilities are not included in maturities by period due to their variable monthly payments. At December 31, 2016, there were no amounts drawn under our revolving conduit facilities. \n \u2022 Other operating expenses increased $78 million primarily due to the net of (i) two months of other operating expenses of $71 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, (ii) an increase in Springleaf advertising expenses of $21 million, (iii) an increase in Springleaf information technology expenses of $8 million, (iv) costs of $7 million recorded in 2014 related to the real estate loan sales, and (v) a $6 million reduction in reserves related to Springleaf estimated Property Protection Insurance claims. \nNet finance receivables of the Other components (which are reported on a Segment Accounting Basis) were as follows:\nLIQUIDATION OF UNITED KINGDOM SUBSIDIARY\n \u2022 the effect of federal, state and local laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and practices; \nInterest income decreased in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the net of the following:\n (a) Represents securities sold at time of issuance or at a later date and does not include retained notes. \nNet Credit Losses\nRecent Developments and Outlook\n \u2022 Salaries and benefits decreased $21 million primarily due to the redistribution of the allocation of salaries and benefit expenses as a result of the real estate loan sales in 2014. \nSegment Accounting Basis\n\nWe assess our operational efficiency using various metrics and conduct extensive analysis to determine whether fluctuations in cost and expense levels indicate operational trends that need to be addressed. Our operating expense analysis also includes a review of origination and servicing costs to assist us in managing overall profitability.\nOther expenses increased $706 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 due to the following:\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the SpringCastle Interests Sale.\n\n \u2022 Finance charges decreased $24 million primarily due to the following: \n \u2022 the elimination of allowance for finance receivable losses of $1 million due to the transfer of personal loans held for investment to finance receivable held for sale during 2015. \nBenefit from income taxes totaled $133 million for 2015 compared to provision for income taxes of $272 million for 2014. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 59.0% compared to 31.6% for 2014. The effective tax rate for 2015 and 2014 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of the non-controlling interest in the previously owned SpringCastle Portfolio and state income taxes. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the effective rates.\n \u2022 Real Estate. \nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes attributable to OMH on a Segment Accounting Basis by segment was as follows:\n \u2022 On February 1, 2017, we completed a private securitization transaction in which OneMain Direct Auto Receivables Trust 2017-1, a wholly owned special purpose vehicle of SFC, issued $300 million principal amount of notes backed by direct auto loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance ( UPB\u201d) of $300 million as of December 31, 2016. See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on this subsequent transaction. \n \u2022 Finance charges increased $1.8 billion primarily due to the net of the following: \nTROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING\nThe largest component of our finance receivables and primary source of our interest income is our personal loan portfolio. Our personal loans are typically non-revolving with a fixed-rate and a fixed, original term of three to six years and are secured by consumer goods, automobiles, or other personal property or are unsecured. At December 31, 2016, 43% of our personal loans were secured by collateral, compared to 27% at December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 Interest income on finance receivables held for sale of $56 million and $43 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, resulted from the transfer of personal loans to finance receivables held for sale on September 30, 2015 and sold in the Lendmark Sale on May 2, 2016. \nSFC's Offering of 8.25% Senior Notes\n\n \u2022 Product opportunities and scale benefits. We expect the OneMain Acquisition to enable us to distribute existing Springleaf products through OneMain branches and leverage key OneMain sales practices to achieve greater scale benefits in existing Springleaf branches. \nProvision for finance receivable losses increased $216 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to (i) provision for finance receivable losses of $229 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, which reflected net charge-offs of $477 million, partially offset by the re-establishment of the allowance for finance receivable losses of $248 million in 2015 and (ii) higher net charge-offs on Springleaf personal loans reflecting growth during the past 12 months. This increase was partially offset by (i) lower net charge-offs on the previously owned SpringCastle Portfolio reflecting the SpringCastle Interests Sale and the improved central servicing performance as the acquired portfolio matured under our ownership and (ii) the continued refinement of our estimates of allowance for finance receivable losses and their related assumptions based on ongoing integration and alignment of collection and charge-off practices.\nInterest expense increased $496 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to (i) interest expense of $284 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition and (ii) a change in the methodology of allocating interest expense, as described in the allocation methodologies table in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report.\nThe following table presents (i) delinquency information of the Company's segments on a Segment Accounting Basis, (a basis other than GAAP), (ii) reconciliations to our total net finance receivables on a GAAP basis, by number of days delinquent, and (iii) delinquency ratios as a percentage of net finance receivables:\nOn March 31, 2016, we sold our equity interest in the SpringCastle Joint Venture, the primary component of our Acquisitions and Servicing segment. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the SpringCastle Interests Sale.\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n \u2022 Significant expansion of our geographical presence. We believe that our expanded footprint will allow us to reach new customers for our personal finance products and further enhance our reputation in the communities we serve. \nProvision for income taxes totaled $113 million for 2016 compared to benefit from income taxes of $133 million for 2015. The effective tax rate for 2016 was 31.8% compared to 59.0% for 2015. The effective tax rate for 2016 and 2015 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of the non-controlling interest in the previously owned SpringCastle Portfolio, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes. As discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report, on March 31, 2016, the Company sold its equity interest in the SpringCastle Portfolio. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the effective rates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \u2022 Diversification of our customer base. Our branch customer base more than doubled as a result of the OneMain Acquisition and, in addition, we believe the OneMain Acquisition will enable us to extend our reach to higher credit score segments than we historically served. \nInterest expense decreased $141 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily due to the sales of the Company's beneficial interests in the mortgage-backed retained certificates during 2014.\n \u2022 Leveraging scale and cost discipline across the company to realize a total of approximately $275 million - $300 million of aggregate acquisition cost synergies. This level of cost synergies is expected to include approximately $200 million of reductions in operating expenses to be fully realized by the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as an incremental $75 million - $100 million of costs that we do not expect to incur as a result of the OneMain Acquisition; \nInterest income decreased $21 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 due to the net of the following:\n * Not applicable. \nOTHER\nincome approach, which uses prospective financial information of the reporting unit discounted at a rate that we estimate a market participant would use. For indefinite lived intangible assets, if the qualitative assessment indicates that the assets are more likely than not to have been impaired, we proceed with the fair value calculation of the assets.\n \u2022 Non-prime: FICO score of 620-659 \n\n \u2022 Reinvigorating growth in receivables at OneMain through enhanced marketing strategies and product options, including an expansion of our direct auto lending; \nNet cash used for investing activities of $2 million for 2016 was primarily due to net principal collections and originations of finance receivables held for investment and held for sale, partially offset by the SpringCastle Interests Sale, the Lendmark Sale, the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale, and the December 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale. Net cash used for investing activities of $2.6 billion for 2015 was primarily due to the OneMain Acquisition. Net cash provided by investing activities of $1.8 billion for 2014 was primarily due to the sales of real estate loans held for sale originated as held for investment during 2014, partially offset by the purchase of investment securities.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had three operating segments:\nWe execute private securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. As of December 31, 2016, our structured financings consisted of the following:\nAs a result of this sale, SpringCastle Acquisition and SpringCastle Holdings no longer hold any ownership interests of the SpringCastle Joint Venture. However, unless we are terminated, we will remain as servicer of the SpringCastle Portfolio under the servicing agreement for the SpringCastle Funding Trust.\n \u2022 obtaining new and extending existing secured revolving facilities to provide committed liquidity in case of prolonged market fluctuations. \nWe consider the following policies to be our most critical accounting policies because they involve critical accounting estimates and a significant degree of management judgment:\n (c) Other consists of: \nONEMAIN ACQUISITION\nFinancing Activities\nOther expenses decreased $12 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily due to decreased credit and collection related costs reflecting lower portfolio servicing costs due to the liquidating status of the acquired portfolio.\nOUR DEBT AGREEMENTS\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on these transactions.\nThere are many different categorizations used in the consumer lending industry to describe the creditworthiness of a borrower, including prime, non-prime, and sub-prime. While our underwriting models are not based on FICO scores, we track and analyze the performance of our finance receivable portfolio using many different parameters, including FICO scores, which is widely recognized in the consumer lending industry.\n (c) The loss ratio in 2014 reflects $2 million of recoveries on charged-off real estate loans resulting from a sale of previously charged-off real estate loans in March of 2014. Excluding these recoveries, our Real Estate loss ratio would have been 2.14% in 2014. \nAt December 31, 2016, our material contractual obligations were as follows:\nOn August 16, 2016, we liquidated our United Kingdom subsidiary, Ocean Finance and Mortgages Limited, which had previously ceased originating real estate loans in 2012. In connection with this liquidation, we recorded a net gain in other revenues of $4 million resulting from a net realized foreign currency translation gain.\nDistribution of Finance Receivables by FICO Score\nInterest expense decreased $169 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to a change in the methodology of allocating interest expense, as described in the allocation methodologies table in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report, and the reallocation of interest expense to the Consumer and Insurance segment as a result of the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale and the December 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale.\n (b) Other expenses for 2015 reflected non-cash incentive compensation relating to the rights of certain executives to receive a portion of the cash proceeds received by the Initial Stockholder. \nOur personal loan volume is generally highest during the second and fourth quarters of the year, primarily due to marketing efforts, seasonality of demand, and increased traffic in branches after the winter months. Demand for our personal loans is usually lower in January and February after the holiday season and as a result of tax refunds. Delinquencies on our personal loans are generally lowest in the first quarter and tend to rise throughout the remainder of the year. These seasonal trends contribute to fluctuations in our operating results and cash needs throughout the year.\n (b) Weighted average interest rate on Springleaf debt increased primarily due to the elimination of debt associated with our mortgage securitizations discussed above, which generally have lower interest rates. This increase was partially offset by the debt repurchases and repayments discussed above, which resulted in lower accretion of net discount, established at the date Fortress acquired a significant ownership interest in OMH, applied to long-term debt. \nWith our experienced management team, long track record of successfully accessing the capital markets, and strong demand for consumer credit, we believe we are well positioned to execute on our strategic priorities of capturing the benefits of the OneMain Acquisition and strengthening our capital base through the following key initiatives:\n \u2022 Retail Sales Finance - We ceased purchasing retail sales contracts and revolving retail accounts in January of 2013. We continue to service the liquidating retail sales contracts and will provide revolving retail sales financing services on our revolving retail accounts. We refer to retail sales contracts and revolving retail accounts collectively as retail sales finance.\u201d \n (c) Operating leases include annual rental commitments for leased office space, automobiles, and information technology and related equipment. \nDuring 2016, we (i) entered into one new conduit facility, (ii) extended the revolving periods on four existing revolving conduit facilities, (iii) amended four existing revolving conduit facilities to change the maximum principal balances, (iv) replaced the 2015 Warehouse Facility with the New Facilities and refinanced two of the New Facilities, and (v) terminated one revolving conduit facility. Net repayments under the notes of our existing revolving conduit facilities totaled $2.6 billion for 2016. The 2015 Warehouse Facility and the New Facilities are described in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report.\nOn November 15, 2015, we completed the OneMain Acquisition, the most significant transaction undertaken by the Company to date. During 2016, many significant integration milestones were achieved, involving substantial changes in operating policies and procedures in the OneMain branch network and significant personnel realignment across our OneMain and Springleaf field management teams. In the second half of 2016, we developed and implemented unified pricing, credit, and underwriting models across our branches, consolidated branch incentive and commission plans, and configured former OneMain branches into the Springleaf data network. We completed the conversion of approximately 100 of the former OneMain branches (representing approximately 10% of the former OneMain branch network's net finance receivables) to the Springleaf loan origination and servicing system. This initial conversion, as well as the re-branding of all Springleaf branches and websites under the OneMain Financial\u201d name and logo, was completed on October 1, 2016. During January and February of 2017, all of the remaining former OneMain branches, as well as our centralized servicing operations, were converted to Springleaf systems, completing the integration.\n (c) OneMain interest expense for 2015 included two months of interest expense on debt acquired in the OneMain Acquisition. See Notes 12 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on OneMain's long-term debt, consumer securitizations, and borrowing under its revolving conduit facility. \nAdjusted Pretax Earnings (Loss)\n (b) The gross charge-off ratio and net charge-off ratio in 2015 reflect $62 million of additional charge-offs recorded in December of 2015 (on a Segment Accounting Basis) related to alignment in charge-off policy for personal loans in connection with the OneMain integration. Excluding these additional charge-offs, our gross charge-off ratio and net charge-off ratio would have been 6.43% and 5.62%, respectively. \n\nOther expenses increased $268 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the following:\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n \u2022 Interest income on real estate loans held for sale decreased $39 million primarily due to lower average real estate loans held for sale during 2015. \nSegment Results\n \u2022 Consumer and Insurance; \nProvision for finance receivable losses increased $560 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to (i) provision for finance receivable losses of $512 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition and (ii) higher net charge-offs on Springleaf personal loans reflecting growth during the past 12 months. This increase was partially offset by the continued refinement of our estimates of allowance for finance receivable losses and their related assumptions based on ongoing integration and alignment of collection and charge-off practices.\n\nWith the systems conversion of the former OneMain branches having been successfully completed in the first quarter of 2017, we expect to be well positioned to resume growth in our net finance receivables beginning in the second quarter of 2017. In addition, with the successful execution of our secured lending and credit risk management strategies, we expect to experience lower future credit losses beginning in late 2017, consistent with our long-term historical experience prior to the acquisition of OneMain. No assurance can be given, however, that these actions and strategies will be effective, that we will be successful in implementing these actions and strategies, or that we will not incur increased credit losses or declines in or lower growth of our personal loan net finance receivables in the future.\nWe closely monitor the primary drivers of pretax operating income, which consist of the following:\n \u2022 Salaries and benefits increased $303 million primarily due to salaries and benefits of $317 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition. This increase was partially offset by non-cash incentive compensation expense of $15 million recorded in 2015 relating to the rights of certain executives to receive a portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of OMH's common stock by the Initial Stockholder. \nProvision for finance receivable losses increased $8 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to a higher real estate loan delinquency ratio at December 31, 2016.\nNet cash used for financing activities of $1.7 billion for 2016 was primarily due to net repayments of long-term debt. Net cash provided by financing activities of $2.0 billion for 2015 reflected the debt issuances associated with the 2015-A and 2015-B securitizations. Net cash used for financing activities of $1.8 billion for 2014 was primarily due to the repayments of the secured term loan and the 2013-BAC trust notes in late March of 2014.\n \u2022 On February 15, 2017, we exercised our right to redeem asset-backed notes issued in March 2014 by Springleaf Funding Trust 2014-A for a redemption price of $188 million. The outstanding principal balance of the asset-backed notes was $221 million on the date of the optional redemption. See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on this subsequent transaction. \n \u2022 Insurance Products - We offer our customers credit insurance (life insurance, disability insurance, and involuntary unemployment insurance) and non-credit insurance through both our combined branch network and our centralized operations. Credit insurance and non-credit insurance products are provided by the Springleaf insurance subsidiaries, Merit and Yosemite, and by the OneMain insurance subsidiaries, AHL and Triton. We also offer auto membership plans of an unaffiliated company as an ancillary product. \nInterest income increased $1.8 billion in 2016 when compared to 2015 due to the following:\nComparison of Consolidated Results for 2015 and 2014\nThe reconciliations of income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes attributable to OMH on a GAAP basis (purchase accounting) to the same amounts under a Segment Accounting Basis were as follows:\nInterest income decreased $338 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the following:\n\n \u2022 Interest income on finance receivables held for sale of $43 million in 2015 resulted from the transfer of personal loans to finance receivables held for sale on September 30, 2015. \n \u2022 Acquisitions and Servicing; and \nWe record an allowance for finance receivable losses to cover expected losses on our finance receivables. Our allowance for finance receivable losses may fluctuate based upon our continual review of the credit quality of the finance receivable portfolios and changes in economic conditions.\nHOW WE ASSESS OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE\nOther revenues increased $54 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the net of (i) two months of other revenues of $62 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, which consisted of insurance revenues of $53 million, investment revenues of $4 million, and remaining other revenue of $5 million and (ii) a decrease in Springleaf insurance revenues of $8 million primarily due to decreases in credit and non-credit earned premiums reflecting the cancellations of dwelling policies as a result of the real estate loan sales during 2014 and fewer non-credit policies written, respectively.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II - Item 8 of this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties, and assumptions. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 3 of this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed in Risk Factors\u201d in Part I - Item 1A of this report.\nKey Financial Definitions\nComparison of Consolidated Results for 2016 and 2015\n \u25e6 Average net receivables increased primarily due to (i) loans acquired in the OneMain Acquisition and (ii) the continued growth of our loan portfolio (primarily of our secured personal loans). This increase was partially offset by the transfer of $608 million of our personal loans to finance receivables held for sale on September 30, 2015. \nOn April 11, 2016, SFC issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 8.25% SFC Notes due 2020 (the 8.25% SFC Notes\u201d) under the Indenture, pursuant to which OMH provided a guarantee of the notes on a senior unsecured basis. SFC used\n \u2022 pursuing additional debt financings (including new securitizations and new unsecured debt issuances, debt refinancing transactions and standby funding facilities), or a combination of the foregoing; \nLiquidity Risks and Strategies\n (a) For purposes of our segment reporting presentation in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report, we have combined the lower of cost or fair value adjustments recorded on the date the real estate loans were transferred to finance receivables held for sale with the final gain (loss) on the sales of these loans. \nOUTLOOK\nAcquisition-related transaction and integration costs of $62 million in 2015 reflected costs relating to the OneMain Acquisition and the Lendmark Sale, including transaction costs, technology termination and certain compensation and benefit related costs.\n (a) Springleaf average net receivables decreased primarily due to (i) Springleaf liquidating real estate loan portfolio, including the transfers of real estate loans with a total carrying value of $6.7 billion to finance receivables held for sale and the subsequent sales of nearly all of these real estate loans during 2014, (ii) the transfer of $608 million of Springleaf personal loans to finance receivables held for sale on September 30, 2015, and (iii) the liquidating status of the SpringCastle Portfolio. This decrease was partially offset by (i) our continued focus on personal loan originations through our branch network and centralized operations and (ii) the launch of Springleaf direct auto loans in June of 2014. \nOther revenues increased $328 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to other revenues of $336 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, which consisted of insurance revenues of $236 million, investment revenues of $71 million, and remaining other revenues of $29 million, partially offset by a decrease in Springleaf investment revenues of $12 million during 2016 resulting from a decrease in invested assets and lower realized gains on the sale of investment securities.\n \u2022 Significant cost savings opportunities by combining complementary businesses. We expect the highly complementary nature of our two operating companies, including branch operations, to enable us to achieve significant ongoing cost savings. Expected drivers of cost savings include consolidation of branch operations, elimination of redundant centralized and corporate functions and greater efficiency of marketing programs. We expect to realize approximately $275 million - $300 million of cost synergies from the OneMain Acquisition by the end of 2017. This level of cost synergies is expected to include approximately $200 million of reductions in operating expenses to be fully realized by the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as an incremental $75 million - $100 million of costs that we do not expect to incur as a result of the OneMain Acquisition. We also anticipate incurring approximately $275 million of acquisition-related expenses to consolidate the two operating companies. As of December 31, 2016, we had incurred approximately $170 million of acquisition-related transaction and integration expenses ($108 million incurred during 2016). \n \u2022 Finance charges decreased $299 million primarily due to the net of the following: \nOther revenues increased $344 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to (i) other revenues of $319 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, which consisted of insurance revenues of $236 million, investment revenues of $54 million, and remaining other revenues of $29 million, including $25 million of revenues from our ancillary products, (ii) servicing charge income for the SpringCastle Portfolio of $33 million in 2016, (iii) net gain on sales of personal and real estate loans of $18 million in 2016, (iv) servicing charge income for the receivables related to the Lendmark Sale of $6 million in 2016, and (v) foreign currency translation adjustment gain of $4 million in 2016 resulting from the liquidation of our United Kingdom subsidiary. This increase was partially offset by (i) a decrease in Springleaf investment revenues of $20 million during 2016 primarily due to a decrease in invested assets and lower realized gains on the sale of investment securities and (ii) net loss on repurchases and repayments of debt of $17 million in 2016.\nOn December 19, 2016, SFC and certain of its subsidiaries sold a portfolio of first and second lien mortgage loans for aggregate cash proceeds of $58 million (the December 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale\u201d) and recorded a net loss in other revenues at the time of sale of less than $1 million.\n\nREAL ESTATE LOAN SALES\nWhen we modify a loan's contractual terms for economic or other reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties and grant a concession that we would not otherwise consider, we classify that loan as a TDR finance receivable. When we modify an account we primarily use a combination of the following to reduce the borrower's monthly payment: reduce interest rate, extend the term, capitalize or forgive past due interest and, to a lesser extent, forgive principal. Account modifications that are deemed to be a TDR finance receivable are measured for impairment in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the accounting for impaired loans.\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the OneMain Acquisition.\n \u25e6 Average net receivables decreased primarily due to our liquidating real estate loan portfolio, including the transfers of $266 million and $49 million of real estate loans to finance receivables held for sale on June 30, 2016 and November 30, 2016, respectively. \nCONSUMER AND INSURANCE\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $579 million of cash and cash equivalents, and during 2016, we generated net income attributable to OMH of $215 million. Our net cash inflow from operating and investing activities totaled $1.3 billion in 2016. At December 31, 2016, our scheduled principal and interest payments for 2017 on our existing debt (excluding securitizations) totaled $1.7 billion. As of December 31, 2016, we had $4.0 billion UPB of unencumbered personal loans and $368 million UPB of unencumbered real estate loans (including $216 million held for sale).\nFollowing the OneMain Acquisition, we include OneMain's operations within the Consumer and Insurance segment. See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for more information about our segments.\nUSES OF FUNDS\n\nProvision for finance receivable losses decreased $37 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily due to lower net charge-offs on the SpringCastle Portfolio reflecting improvements in servicing of the acquired portfolio and its liquidating status.\n \u25e6 Yield increased primarily due to a higher proportion of our remaining real estate loans during 2015 that were secured by second mortgages, which generally have higher yields. \n (d) Other consists of the elimination of allowance for finance receivable losses due to the transfer of real estate loans held for investment to finance receivable held for sale during 2014. \n (a) Average net receivables increased primarily due to (i) loans acquired in the OneMain Acquisition and (ii) the continued growth of our loan portfolio (primarily of our secured personal loans). This increase was partially offset by (i) the SpringCastle Interests Sale, (ii) the transfer of $608 million of our personal loans to finance receivables held for sale on September 30, 2015, and (iii) our liquidating real estate loan portfolio, including the transfers of $257 million and $50 million of real estate loans to finance receivables held for sale on June 30, 2016 and November 30, 2016, respectively. \n \u2022 Insurance policy benefits and claims increased $21 million due to two months of insurance policy benefits and claims of $24 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, partially offset by a $3 million decrease in Springleaf insurance policy benefits and claims during 2015 primarily due to favorable variances in benefit reserves. \n \u2022 Sub-prime: FICO score of 619 or below \n \u25e6 Yield decreased primarily due to the continued growth of secured personal loans, which generally have lower yields relative to our unsecured personal loans. \nWe estimate the allowance for finance receivable losses primarily on historical loss experience using a roll rate-based model applied to our finance receivable portfolios. In our roll rate-based model, our finance receivable types are stratified by delinquency stages (i.e., current, 1-29 days past due, 30-59 days past due, etc.) and projected forward in one-month increments using historical roll rates. In each month of the simulation, losses on our finance receivable types are captured, and the ending delinquency stratification serves as the beginning point of the next iteration. No new volume is assumed. This process is repeated until the number of iterations equals the loss emergence period (the interval of time between the event which causes a borrower to default on a finance receivable and our recording of the charge-off) for our finance receivable types.\nWe consider the delinquency status of our finance receivable as the primary indicator of credit quality. We monitor delinquency trends to evaluate the risk of future credit losses and employ advanced analytical tools to manage our exposure and appetite. Our branch team members work with customers through occasional periods of financial difficulty and offer a variety of borrower assistance programs to help customers continue to make payments. Team members also actively engage in collection activities throughout the early stages of delinquency. We closely track and report the percentage of receivables that are 30-89 days past due as a benchmark of portfolio quality, collections effectiveness, and as a strong indicator of losses in coming quarters.\n \u25e6 Average net receivables decreased primarily due to the continued liquidation of the real estate loan portfolio, including the transfers of real estate loans with a total carrying value of $7.2 billion to finance receivables held for sale and the subsequent sales of nearly all of these real estate loans during 2014. \nACQUISITIONS AND SERVICING\n \u2022 Maintaining a strong liquidity level and diversified funding sources. \nDELINQUENCY\n \u2022 Insurance policy benefits and claims increased $16 million due to two months of insurance policy benefits and claims of $19 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in Springleaf insurance policy benefits and claims of $3 million primarily due to favorable variances in benefit reserves. \n \u2022 Reducing leverage; and \nInterest income increased in 2016 when compared to 2015 due to the net of the following:\n \u2022 the addition to allowance for finance receivable losses of $666 million due to the personal loans acquired in connection with the OneMain Acquisition and the offsetting Segment to GAAP adjustment; and \n (b) Not applicable. \nInvesting Activities\nOn November 15, 2015, we completed the OneMain Acquisition. The results of OneMain are included in our consolidated operating results and selected financial statistics from November 1, 2015 in the table below. A further discussion of our operating results for each of our operating segments is provided under Segment Results\u201d below.\nREAL ESTATE\nResults of Operations\n \u2022 SpringCastle Interests Sale; \nALLOWANCE FOR FINANCE RECEIVABLE LOSSES\nThe debt agreements to which SFC, OMFH, and their subsidiaries are a party include customary terms and conditions, including covenants and representations and warranties. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the restrictive covenants under SFC's and OMFH's debt agreements, as well as the guarantees of SFC's and OMFH's long-term debt.\nSOURCES OF FUNDS\nThe following table presents the composition of our finance receivables for each of the Company's segments on a Segment Accounting Basis (a basis other than GAAP), as well as reconciliations to our total net finance receivables on a GAAP basis:\nOther expenses decreased $46 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to the following:\nInterest expense increased in 2016 when compared to 2015 due to the net of the following:\n (a) See Key Financial Definitions\u201d at the end of our management's discussion and analysis for formulas and definitions of key performance ratios. \n \u2022 Other operating expenses decreased $25 million primarily resulting from the sales of real estate loans during 2014 and the redistribution of the allocation of other operating expenses as a result of the real estate loan sales in 2014. \n \u2022 Real Estate Loans - We ceased real estate lending in January of 2012, and during 2014, we sold $6.4 billion real estate loans held for sale. In connection with the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale and the December 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale (as discussed and defined in Recent Developments and Outlook\u201d below), we sold $308 million real estate loans held for sale. The remaining real estate loans may be closed-end accounts or open-end home equity lines of credit, generally have a fixed rate and maximum original terms of 360 months, and are secured by first or second mortgages on residential real estate. Predominantly, our first lien mortgages are serviced by third-party servicers, and we continue to provide servicing for our second lien mortgages (home equity lines of credit). At December 31, 2016, we had $144 million of real estate loans held for investment, of which 93% were secured by first mortgages, compared to $538 million at December 31, 2015, of which 38% were secured by first mortgages. Real estate loans held for sale totaled $153 million and $176 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \nAdjusted pretax operating results and selected financial statistics for Consumer and Insurance (which are reported on an adjusted Segment Accounting Basis) were as follows:\n \u2022 Finance charges increased $523 million due to (i) two months of finance charges of $355 million in 2015 resulting from the OneMain Acquisition and (ii) an increase in Springleaf finance charges of $168 million primarily due to higher average net receivables, partially offset by lower yield. Average net receivables increased primarily due to our continued focus on personal loans, including the launch of Springleaf direct auto loans in June of 2014. Yield decreased primarily due to the higher proportion of Springleaf direct auto loans, which generally have lower yields. \n\n \u2022 Insurance policy benefits and claims increased $70 million primarily due to insurance policy benefits and claims of $87 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition. This increase was partially offset by a $17 million decrease in Springleaf insurance policy benefits and claims during 2016 primarily due to favorable variances in benefit reserves, which partially resulted from a $9 million write-down of benefit reserves recorded during 2016. \n \u2022 Lendmark Sale; \nSee Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for (i) a description of our segments, (ii) reconciliations of segment totals to consolidated financial statement amounts, (iii) methodologies used to allocate revenues and expenses to each segment, and (iv) further discussion of the differences in our Segment Accounting Basis and GAAP.\nOther\u201d consists of our other non-originating legacy operations, which are isolated by geographic market and/or distribution channel from our three segments. These operations include: (i) Springleaf legacy operations in 14 states where we had also ceased branch-based personal lending during 2012; (ii) Springleaf liquidating retail sales finance portfolio (including retail sales finance accounts from its legacy auto finance operation); (iii) Springleaf lending operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands; and (iv) the operations of Springleaf United Kingdom subsidiary prior to its liquidation on August 16, 2016.\na portion of the proceeds from the offering to repurchase approximately $600 million aggregate principal amount of its existing senior notes that mature in 2017 and the remainder for general corporate purposes. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on this offering.\nOther expenses increased $695 million in 2016 when compared to 2015 due to the following:\nThe reconciliations of income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes attributable to OMH on a Segment Accounting Basis to adjusted pretax earnings (loss) (non-GAAP) by segment were as follows:\nTDR FINANCE RECEIVABLES\nHowever, it is possible that the actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or that one or more of our significant judgments or estimates could prove to be materially incorrect.\nOUR SEGMENTS\nOn November 15, 2015, we completed our acquisition of OneMain. The OneMain Acquisition brings together two branch-based consumer finance companies with complementary strategies and locations, focused on the non-prime market in the United States.\nChanges in the allowance for finance receivable losses for each of the Company's segments on a Segment Accounting Basis, (a basis other than GAAP), as well as reconciliations to our total allowance for finance receivable losses on a GAAP basis, were as follows:\nThe delinquency status of our finance receivable portfolio, along with the level of our troubled debt restructured ( TDR\u201d) finance receivables, are the primary drivers that can cause fluctuations in our allowance for finance receivable losses from period to period. We monitor the allowance ratio to ensure we have a sufficient level of allowance for finance receivable losses to cover estimated incurred losses in our finance receivable portfolio.\n\n\nManagement exercises its judgment, based on quantitative analyses, qualitative factors, such as recent delinquency and other credit trends, and experience in the consumer finance industry, when determining the amount of the allowance for finance receivable losses. We adjust the amounts determined by the roll rate-based model for management's estimate of the effects of model imprecision which include but are not limited to, any changes to underwriting criteria, portfolio seasoning, and current economic conditions, including levels of unemployment and personal bankruptcies.\nOn March 31, 2016, Springleaf Finance, Inc., SpringCastle Holdings, LLC ( SpringCastle Holdings\u201d) and Springleaf Acquisition Corporation ( Springleaf Acquisition\u201d and, together with SpringCastle Holdings, the SpringCastle Sellers\u201d), wholly owned subsidiaries of OMH, entered into a purchase agreement with certain subsidiaries of New Residential Investment Corp. ( NRZ\u201d and such subsidiaries, the NRZ Buyers\u201d) and BTO Willow Holdings II, L.P. and Blackstone Family Tactical Opportunities Investment Partnership-NQ-ESC L.P. (collectively, the Blackstone Buyers\u201d and together with the NRZ Buyers, the SpringCastle Buyers\u201d). Pursuant to the purchase agreement, on March 31, 2016, SpringCastle Holdings sold its 47% limited liability company interest in each of SpringCastle America, LLC, SpringCastle Credit, LLC and SpringCastle Finance, LLC, and Springleaf Acquisition sold its 47% limited liability company interest in SpringCastle Acquisition LLC, to the SpringCastle Buyers for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $112 million (the SpringCastle Interests Sale\u201d). SpringCastle America, LLC, SpringCastle Credit, LLC, SpringCastle Finance, LLC and SpringCastle Acquisition LLC are collectively referred to herein as the SpringCastle Joint Venture.\u201d\nWe report the operating results of Consumer and Insurance, Acquisitions and Servicing, Real Estate, and Other using the Segment Accounting Basis, which (i) reflects our allocation methodologies for certain costs, primarily interest expense, loan loss reserves and acquisition costs to reflect the manner in which we assess our business results and (ii) excludes the impact of applying purchase accounting (eliminates premiums/discounts on our finance receivables and long-term debt at acquisition, as well as the amortization/accretion in future periods). These allocations and adjustments currently have a material effect on our reported segment basis income as compared to GAAP. See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for a complete discussion of our segment accounting. We believe the Segment Accounting Basis (a basis other than GAAP) provides investors a consistent basis on which management evaluates segment performance.\nIn addition to cash received from our senior notes offering and securitization transactions, our sources of funds were favorably impacted by the following transactions:\nComparison of Adjusted Pretax Operating Results for 2016 and 2015\n\nOther Transactions\nInformation regarding TDR finance receivables held for investment for each of the Company's segments on a Segment Accounting Basis, (a basis other than GAAP), as well as reconciliations to information regarding our total TDR finance receivables held for investment on a GAAP basis, were as follows:\nInterest income decreased $82 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily due to lower average net receivables reflecting the liquidating status of the SpringCastle Portfolio.\nThe estimated synergies were derived by comparing the operating expenses expected in the second half of 2017 of the combined operations to the sum of operating expenses expected to be generated on a stand-alone basis, as if each company had the same business strategies. The foregoing estimates of synergies and charges in connection with consolidating the two companies and expectations regarding when they will be fully reflected in our results are subject to various risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Therefore, no assurance can be given as to when or if they will be realized. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 3 of this report.\n (b) Springleaf yield increased primarily due to a higher proportion of Springleaf personal loans, which have higher yields, as a result of the real estate loan sales during 2014. The increase in yield was partially offset by the launch of our direct auto loans in June of 2014, which generally has lower yields. \n \u2022 the elimination of allowance for finance receivable losses due to the transfers of real estate loans held for investment to finance receivable held for sale during 2016. \nAcquisition-related transaction and integration costs of $108 million and $62 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, reflected increased costs relating to the OneMain Acquisition and the Lendmark Sale, including branch and system conversions, information technology costs, certain compensation and benefit related costs, and other costs and fees that would not have been incurred in the ordinary course of business. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for further information regarding these costs.\n (a) Interest expense for 2016 when compared to 2015 reflected a change in the methodology of allocating interest expense, as described in the allocation methodologies table in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report. \n (a) Springleaf average debt decreased primarily due to debt repurchases and repayments of $2.0 billion during 2015 and the elimination of $3.5 billion of debt associated with our mortgage securitizations. These decreases were partially offset by net debt issuances pursuant to SFC's consumer securitization transactions completed during 2015 and additional borrowings under its conduit facilities. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on SFC's consumer loan securitization transactions and borrowings under its conduit facilities. \nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nStructured Financings\nWe finance the majority of our operating liquidity and capital needs through a combination of cash flows from operations, securitization debt, borrowings from conduit facilities, unsecured debt and equity, and may also utilize other corporate debt facilities in the future. As a holding company, all of the funds generated from our operations are earned by our operating subsidiaries.\n\n (a) See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the components of our GAAP to Segment Accounting Basis adjustments. \nWe also report selected financial statistics relating to the net finance receivables and credit quality of Consumer and Insurance, Acquisitions and Servicing, Real Estate, and Other using a Segment Accounting Basis.\n (c) Not applicable. \nComparison of Adjusted Pretax Operating Results for 2015 and 2014\n (b) See Key Financial Definitions\u201d at the end of our management's discussion and analysis for formulas and definitions of key performance ratios. \nWe group FICO scores into the following credit strength categories:\nThere are numerous risks to our financial results, liquidity, capital raising, and debt refinancing plans, some of which may not be quantified in our current liquidity forecasts. These risks include, but are not limited, to the following:\n \u2022 December 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale. \nAssuming the U.S. economy continues to experience slow to moderate growth, we expect to continue our long history of strong credit performance and believe the strong credit quality of our loan portfolio will continue as the result of our disciplined underwriting practices and ongoing collection efforts. We have continued to see some migration of customer activity away from traditional channels, such as direct mail, to online channels (primarily serviced through our combined branch network), where we believe we are well suited to capture volume due to our scale, technology, and deployment of advanced analytics.\nDuring 2016, the allowance for finance receivables for our consumer and insurance segment decreased $37 million, while the 60+ days delinquency ratio increased 40 basis points to 3.59% at December 31, 2016. The required allowance increase resulting from the higher delinquency ratio was more than offset by a decline of $81 million in our TDR finance receivables and a corresponding decline of $83 million in the allowance for TDR finance receivable losses during 2016.\nOn August 3, 2016, SFC and certain of its subsidiaries sold a portfolio of second lien mortgage loans for aggregate cash proceeds of $246 million (the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale\u201d) and recorded a net loss in other revenues at the time of sale of $4 million. The proceeds from this sale, together with cash on hand, were used to pay off $375 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes that matured in the third quarter of 2016. Unless we are terminated or we resign as servicer, we will continue to service the loans included in this sale pursuant to a servicing agreement. The purchase and sale agreement and the servicing agreement include customary representations and warranties and indemnification provisions.\n * See Key Financial Definitions\u201d at the end of our management's discussion and analysis for formulas and definitions of key performance ratios. \n (b) See Key Financial Definitions\u201d at the end of our management's discussion and analysis for formulas and definitions of key performance ratios. \n \u2022 the elimination of allowance for finance receivable losses due to the sale of the SpringCastle Portfolio on March 31, 2016, in connection with the sale of our equity interest in the SpringCastle Joint Venture. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on this sale; and \n (d) Delinquency ratio at December 31, 2016 reflected the retained real estate loan portfolio that was not eligible for sale. \nNet Interest Income\n \u2022 Prime: FICO score of 660 or higher \n (c) Interest income on finance receivables held for sale increased primarily due to (i) the transfer of $608 million of our personal loans to held for sale on September 30, 2015, which were sold in the Lendmark Sale on May 2, 2016, and (ii) the transfers of $307 million of real estate loans to finance receivables held for sale during 2016, which were sold in the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale and December 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale. \nOur securitizations have served to partially replace secured and unsecured debt in our capital structure with more favorable non-recourse funding. Our overall funding costs are positively impacted by our increased usage of securitizations, as we typically execute these transactions at interest rates significantly below those of our unsecured debt.\nOur products also included the SpringCastle Portfolio at December 31, 2015, as described below:\n \u2022 the potential for disruptions in the debt and equity markets. \naggregate cash purchase price of $624 million. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report for further information on the Settlement Agreement and the Lendmark Sale.\n (b) Future interest payments on floating-rate debt are estimated based upon floating rates in effect at December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 Other operating expenses increased $301 million primarily due to (i) other operating expenses of $266 million resulting from the OneMain Acquisition, which consisted primarily of advertising expenses of $74 million, occupancy costs of $66 million, and information technology expenses of $49 million, (ii) a decrease in Springleaf deferred origination costs of $13 million during 2016, (iii) an increase in Springleaf information technology expenses of $12 million during 2016, (iv) an increase in Springleaf advertising expenses of $6 million during 2016, and (v) an increase in Springleaf credit and collection related costs of $6 million during 2016 reflecting growth in our loan portfolio. \nManagement is responsible for the determination of the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities and the supporting methodologies and assumptions. We employ widely used financial techniques or utilize third-party valuation service providers to gather, analyze, and interpret market information and derive fair values based upon relevant methodologies and assumptions for individual instruments or pools of finance receivables. When our valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security, we determine fair value either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a quote, which is generally non-binding, or by employing widely used financial techniques.\nFor goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, we first complete a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test annually as of October 1 of each year. For goodwill, if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, we proceed with the two-step impairment test. When necessary, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated utilizing the\nFor those net intangible assets with a finite useful life, we review such intangibles for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nThe allowance for finance receivable losses related to our TDR finance receivables represents loan-specific reserves based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows. We establish our allowance for finance receivable losses related to our TDR finance receivables by calculating the present value (discounted at the loan's effective interest rate prior to modification) of all expected cash flows less the recorded investment in the aggregated pool. We use certain assumptions to estimate the expected cash flows from our TDR finance receivables. The primary assumptions for our model are prepayment speeds, default rates, and severity rates.\nALLOWANCE FOR FINANCE RECEIVABLE LOSSES\n \u2022 Growing secured lending originations at OneMain with a goal of enhancing credit performance; \n\nAdjusted pretax operating results and selected financial statistics for Acquisitions and Servicing (which are reported on an adjusted Segment Accounting Basis) were as follows:\nNet cash provided by operations of $1.3 billion for 2016 reflected net income of $243 million, the impact of non-cash items, and an unfavorable change in working capital of $115 million. Net cash provided by operations of $735 million for 2015 reflected a net loss of $93 million, the impact of non-cash items, and a favorable change in working capital of $97 million. Net cash provided by operations of $381 million for 2014 reflected net income of $589 million, the impact of non-cash items, and an unfavorable change in working capital of $107 million primarily due to costs relating to the real estate sales transactions.\nAdjusted pretax operating results of the Other components (which are reported on an adjusted Segment Accounting Basis) were as follows:\nOur non-originating legacy products include:\nTax Reform Proposals\nIn addition to the structured financings included in the table above, we had access to 11 conduit facilities with a total borrowing capacity of $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2016, as discussed in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8 of this report. At December 31, 2016, no amounts were drawn under these facilities.\nAdjusted pretax operating results and selected financial statistics for Real Estate (which are reported on an adjusted Segment Accounting Basis) were as follows:\nSFC's and OMFH's credit ratings are non-investment grade, which have a significant impact on our cost of, and access to, capital. This, in turn, can negatively affect our ability to manage our liquidity and our ability or cost to refinance our indebtedness.\nBased on our estimates and taking into account the risks and uncertainties of our plans, we believe that we will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate our businesses and repay our obligations as they become due for at least the next 12 months.\n\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe make modifications to our finance receivables to assist borrowers during times of financial difficulties. When we modify a loan's contractual terms for economic or other reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties and grant a concession that we would not otherwise consider, we classify that loan as a TDR finance receivable.\nSeasonality\nOperating Activities\n\n (b) Represents UPB of the collateral supporting the issued and retained notes. \nThe credit quality of our loans is driven by our long-standing underwriting philosophy, which takes into account the prospective customer's household budget, and his or her willingness and capacity to repay the proposed loan. The profitability of our loan portfolio is directly connected to net credit losses; therefore, we closely analyze credit performance. We also monitor recovery rates because of their contribution to the reduction in the severity of our charge-offs. Additionally, because delinquencies are an early indicator of future net credit losses, we analyze delinquency trends, adjusting for seasonality, to determine whether or not our loans are performing in line with our original estimates.\nOperating Expenses", "item_7_tables": "Table 321: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Acquisition and an increase in Springleaf staffing prior to the Lendmark Sale.\n\n- Interest income increased $1.8 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to loans acquired in the OneMain Acquisition and growth of the loan portfolio. This was partially offset by lower interest income on real estate loans held for sale.\n\n- Provision for finance receivable losses increased $560 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to provision resulting from the OneMain Acquisition and higher net charge-offs on Springleaf personal loans.  \n\n- Other revenues increased $344 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to revenues resulting from the OneMain Acquisition. This was partially offset by lower investment revenues.\n\n- Other expenses increased $695 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to expenses resulting from the OneMain Acquisition.\n\n- Net income attributable to OMH was $215 million in 2016 compared to a net loss of $220 million in 2015.\n\n- At December 31, 2016, net finance receivables totaled $13.7 billion compared to $15.6 billion at December 31, 2015. \n\n- The allowance for finance receivable losses was $689 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $592 million at December 31, 2015.\n\nIn summary, the increase in interest income, provision for losses, and expenses in 2016 was primarily driven by the OneMain Acquisition. Net finance receivables decreased from 2015 due to loan sales, while the allowance for losses increased due to provision related to the OneMain loans."}
