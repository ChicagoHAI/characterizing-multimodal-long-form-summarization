Business.\"\nIn June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply executed definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to spin off PPL Energy Supply and immediately combine it with Riverstone's competitive power generation businesses to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy. On June 1, 2015, the spinoff was completed. See \"Financial and Operational Developments - Other Financial and Operational Developments - Spinoff of PPL Energy Supply\" below for additional information.\nBusiness Strategy\n(All Registrants)\nFollowing the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, PPL completed its strategic transformation to a fully regulated business model consisting of seven diverse, high-performing utilities. These utilities are located in the U.K., Pennsylvania and Kentucky and each jurisdiction has different regulatory structures and customer classes. The Company believes this diverse portfolio provides strong earnings and dividend growth potential that will create significant value for its shareowners and positions PPL well for continued growth and success.\nTable 217: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPPL's businesses of WPD, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU plan to achieve this growth by providing efficient, reliable and safe operations and strong customer service, maintaining constructive regulatory relationships and achieving timely recovery of costs. These businesses are expected to achieve strong, long-term growth in rate base and RAV, as applicable, driven by planned significant capital expenditures to maintain existing assets and improve system reliability and, for LKE, LG&E and KU, to comply with federal and state environmental regulations related to coal-fired electricity generation facilities. Additionally, significant transmission rate base growth is expected through 2020 at PPL Electric.\nFor the U.S. businesses, our strategy is to recover capital project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test years, annual FERC formula rate mechanisms and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory lag. In Kentucky, the KPSC has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ECR, DSM, GLT, fuel adjustment clause, gas supply clause and recovery on construction work-in-progress) that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In addition, the KPSC requires a utility to obtain a CPCN prior to constructing a facility, unless the construction is an ordinary extension of existing facilities in the usual course of business or does not involve sufficient capital outlay to materially affect the utility's financial condition. Although such KPSC proceedings do not directly address cost recovery issues, the KPSC, in awarding a CPCN, concludes that the public convenience and necessity require the construction of the facility on the basis that the facility is the lowest reasonable cost alternative for addressing the need. In Pennsylvania, the FERC transmission formula rate, DSIC mechanism, Smart Meter Rider and other recovery mechanisms are in place to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on prudently incurred costs.\nAlthough rate base growth in the domestic utilities is expected to result in strong earnings growth for the foreseeable future, PPL does not expect significant earnings growth from the U.K. Regulated segment under the RIIO-ED1 price control period, which began on April 1, 2015. Although the U.K. Regulated segment also projects strong RAV growth, earnings from this segment are expected to be relatively flat from 2015 to 2017 during the transition to RIIO-ED1. Higher revenues resulting from the fast-track bonus are partially offset by higher levels of revenue profiling in the prior price control period (DPCR5) and a lower return on regulatory equity. In addition, starting in 2017, the amount of incentive revenues WPD is able to earn is expected to decline as a result of more stringent reliability and customer service targets established by Ofgem under RIIO-ED1. See \"Item 1. Business - General - Segment Information - U.K. Regulated Segment\" for additional information on revenues under RIIO-ED1.\nTo manage financing costs and access to credit markets, and to fund capital expenditures, a key objective of the Registrants is to maintain their investment grade credit ratings and adequate liquidity positions. In addition, the Registrants have financial and operational risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility, as applicable, related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and counterparty credit quality. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options, and swaps.\nAs discussed above, a key component of this strategy is to maintain constructive relationships with our regulators in all jurisdictions in which we operate (U.K., U.S. federal and state). This is supported by our strong culture of integrity and delivering on commitments to our customers, regulators and shareowners, and a commitment to continue to improve our customer service, reliability and efficiency of operations.\n(PPL)\nEarnings generated by PPL's U.K. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk. The U.K. subsidiaries also have currency exposure to the U.S. dollar to the extent of their U.S. dollar denominated debt. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and cross currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency exchange contracts.\nFollowing the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, PPL has no continuing ownership interest in or control of Talen Energy and Talen Energy Supply (formerly, PPL Energy Supply).\nSee \"Item 1.

This increase is primarily attributable to increases in the Kentucky Regulated and Pennsylvania Regulated segments. The following projections and factors underlying these projections (on an after-tax basis) are provided for PPL's segments and the Corporate and Other category and the related Registrants.\n(PPL's U.K. Regulated Segment)\nExcluding special items, relatively flat earnings are projected in 2016 compared with 2015, due to higher financing costs, depreciation expense, currency, taxes and other expenses, partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expense, including pension expense, and higher gross margins. The 2016 foreign currency exposure for this segment is 95% hedged at an average rate of $1.56 per pound.\n(PPL's Kentucky Regulated Segment and LKE, LG&E and KU)\nExcluding special items, higher earnings are projected in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily driven by electric and gas base rate increases effective July 1, 2015, and higher returns on additional environmental capital investments, partially offset by higher depreciation expense and higher financing costs.\nTable 224: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(PPL's Pennsylvania Regulated Segment and PPL Electric)\nExcluding special items, higher earnings are projected in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily driven by a distribution base rate increase effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins, partially offset by higher depreciation expense, higher financing costs and a benefit received in 2015 from the release of a gross receipts tax reserve.\n(PPL's Corporate and Other Category)\nExcluding special items, costs are projected to be relatively flat in 2016 compared with 2015.\n(All Registrants)\nEarnings in future periods are subject to various risks and uncertainties. See \"Forward-Looking Information,\" \"Item 1. Business,\" \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" the rest of this Item 7, and Notes 1, 6 and 13 to the Financial Statements (as applicable) for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and factors that may impact future earnings.\nOther Financial and Operational Developments\nRegulatory Requirements\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nThe businesses of LKE, LG&E and KU are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to CCRs, GHG, ELGs, MATS and the Clean Power Plan. See \"Financial Condition - Environmental Matters\" below for additional information on the CCRs requirements and Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the other significant environmental matters. These and other stringent environmental requirements have led PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU to retire approximately 800 megawatts of coal-fired generating plants in Kentucky. In September 2015, KU retired two coal-fired units, with a combined summer capacity rating of 161 MW, at the Green River plant. LG&E retired a 240 MW coal-fired unit in March 2015 and two additional coal-fired units, with a combined summer capacity rating of 323 MW, in June 2015 at the Cane Run plant. KU retired a 71 MW coal-fired unit at the Tyrone plant in 2013. The retirement of these units is not expected to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU.\nAlso as a result of the environmental requirements discussed above, LKE projects $1.9 billion ($1.0 billion at KU and $0.9 billion at LG&E) in environmental capital investment over the next five years. See PPL's \"Financial Condition - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures\", Note 6 and Note 13 for additional information.\n(All Registrants)\nThe Registrants cannot predict the impact that future regulatory requirements may have on their financial condition or results of operations.\n(PPL)\nSpinoff of PPL Energy Supply\nIn June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply executed definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to spin off PPL Energy Supply and immediately combine it with Riverstone's competitive power generation businesses to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy. In June 2015, the spinoff was completed. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information relating to the transaction.\nLoss on Spinoff\nIn conjunction with the accounting for the spinoff, PPL evaluated whether the fair value of the Supply segment's net assets was less than the carrying value as of the June 1, 2015 spinoff date.\nPPL considered several valuation methodologies to derive a fair value estimate of its Supply segment at the spinoff date. These methodologies included considering the closing \"when-issued\" Talen Energy market value on June 1, 2015 (the spinoff\nTable 225: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\ndate) adjusted for the proportional share of the equity value attributable to the Supply segment, as well as the valuation methods consistently used in PPL's goodwill impairment assessments - an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis of the Supply segment and an alternative market approach considering market multiples of comparable companies.\nAlthough the market value of Talen Energy approach utilized the most observable inputs of the three approaches, PPL considered certain limitations of the \"when-issued\" trading market for the spinoff transaction including the short trading duration, lack of liquidity in the market and anticipated initial Talen stock ownership base selling pressure, among other factors, and concluded that these factors limit the appropriateness of this input being solely determinative of the fair value of the Supply segment. As such, PPL also considered the other valuation approaches in estimating the overall fair value, but ultimately assigned the highest weighting to the Talen Energy market value approach.\nThe following table summarizes PPL's fair value analysis:\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Approach </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Weighting </td> <td> </td> <td>(in billions) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Talen Energy Market Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.4 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income/Discounted Cash Flow </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Alternative Market (Comparable Company) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Estimated Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.2 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA key assumption included in the fair value estimate is the application of a control premium of 25% in the two market approaches. PPL concluded it was appropriate to apply a control premium in these approaches as the goodwill impairment testing guidance was followed in determining the estimated fair value of the Supply segment, which had historically been a reporting unit for PPL. This guidance provides that the market price of an individual security (and thus the market capitalization of a reporting unit with publically traded equity securities) may not be representative of the fair value of the reporting unit. This guidance also indicates that substantial value may arise to a controlling shareholder from the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that arise from control over another entity, and that the market price of a Company's individual share of stock does not reflect this additional value to a controlling shareholder. Therefore, the quoted market price need not be the sole measurement basis for determining the fair value, and including a control premium is appropriate in measuring the fair value of a reporting unit.\nIn determining the control premium, PPL reviewed premiums received during the last five years in market sales transactions obtained from observable independent power producer and hybrid utility transactions greater than $1 billion. Premiums for these transactions ranged from 5% to 42% with a median of approximately 25%. Given these metrics, PPL concluded a control premium of 25% to be reasonable for both of the market valuation approaches used.\nAssumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis included forward energy prices, forecasted generation, and forecasted operation and maintenance expenditures that were consistent with assumptions used in the Energy Supply portion of the recent Talen Energy business planning process and a market participant discount rate.\nUsing these methodologies and weightings, PPL determined the estimated fair value of the Supply segment (classified as Level 3) was below its carrying value of $4.1 billion and recorded a loss on the spinoff of $879 million in the second quarter of 2015, which is reflected in discontinued operations and is nondeductible for tax purposes. This amount served to reduce the basis of the net assets accounted for as a dividend at the June 1, 2015 spinoff date.\nCosts of Spinoff\nFollowing the announcement of the transaction to form Talen Energy, efforts were initiated to identify the appropriate staffing for Talen Energy and for PPL and its subsidiaries following completion of the spinoff. Organizational plans were substantially completed in 2014. The new organizational plans identified the need to resize and restructure the organizations and as a result, in 2014, estimated charges of $36 million for employee separation benefits were recorded related to 306 positions. Of this amount, $16 million related to 112 Energy Supply positions and is reflected in discontinued operations. The remaining $20 million is primarily reflected in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the PPL Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2015, the organizational structures were finalized for both PPL and Talen Energy which resulted in an additional charge of $10 million for employee separation benefits. Of this amount, $2 million related to Energy Supply positions and is reflected in discontinued operations. The remaining $8 million is reflected in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the PPL Consolidated Statements of Income. The separation benefits include cash severance compensation, lump sum COBRA reimbursement payments and outplacement services. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the recorded\nTable 227: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nliabilities related to the separation benefits were $13 million and $20 million, which are included in \"Other current liabilities\" on the Balance Sheets.\nAdditional employee-related costs incurred primarily included accelerated stock-based compensation and prorated performance-based cash incentive and stock-based compensation awards, primarily for PPL Energy Supply employees and for PPL Services employees who became PPL Energy Supply employees in connection with the transaction. PPL Energy Supply recognized $24 million of these costs at the spinoff closing date in 2015, which are reflected in discontinued operations.\nPPL recorded $45 million and $27 million of third-party costs related to this transaction in 2015 and 2014. Of these costs, $32 million and $19 million were primarily for bank advisory, legal and accounting fees to facilitate the transaction, and are reflected in discontinued operations. An additional $13 million and $8 million of consulting and other costs were incurred in 2015 and 2014, related to the formation of the Talen Energy organization and to reconfigure the remaining PPL service functions. These costs are recorded primarily in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income. No significant additional third-party costs are expected to be incurred.\nAt the close of the transaction in 2015, $72 million ($42 million after-tax) of cash flow hedges, primarily unamortized losses on PPL interest rate swaps recorded in AOCI and designated as cash flow hedges of PPL Energy Supply's future interest payments, were reclassified into interest expense and reflected in discontinued operations.\nAs a result of the June 2014 spinoff announcement, PPL recorded $50 million of deferred income tax expense in 2014, to adjust valuation allowances on deferred tax assets primarily for state net operating loss carryforwards that were previously supported by the future earnings of PPL Energy Supply.\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe operations of PPL's Supply segment are included in \"Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)\" on the Statements of Income.\nThe assets and liabilities of PPL's Supply segment for all periods prior to the spinoff are included in \"Current assets of discontinued operations\", \"Noncurrent assets of discontinued operations\", \"Current liabilities of discontinued operations\" and \"Noncurrent liabilities of discontinued operations\" on PPL's Balance Sheet.\nNet assets, after recognition of the loss on spinoff, of $3.2 billion were distributed to PPL shareowners in the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply.\nSee Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information related to the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, including the components of Discontinued Operations.\n(PPL)\nRIIO-ED1\nOn April 1, 2015, the RIIO-ED1 eight-year price control period commenced for WPD's four DNOs. In February 2014, Ofgem published formal confirmation that WPD's Business Plans submitted by its four DNOs under RIIO-ED1 were accepted as submitted, or \"fast-tracked.\" Fast tracking afforded several benefits to the WPD DNOs including the ability to collect additional revenue equivalent to 2.5% of Totex during the eight-year price control period (approximately $43 million annually), greater revenue certainty and a higher level of cost savings retention. See \"Item 1. Business - Segment Information - U.K. Regulated Segment\" for additional information on RIIO-ED1.\nU.K. Depreciation\nEffective January 1, 2015, after completing a review of the useful lives of its distribution network assets, WPD extended the weighted average useful lives of these assets to 69 years from 55 years for GAAP reporting of depreciation expense. For 2015, this change in useful lives resulted in lower depreciation expense of $84 million ($66 million after-tax or $0.10 per share).\nTable 228: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nU.K. Distribution Revenue Reduction\nIn December 2013, WPD and other U.K. DNOs announced agreements with the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change and Ofgem to a reduction of \u00a35 per residential customer of electricity distribution revenues that otherwise would have been collected in the regulatory year beginning April 1, 2014. Full recovery of the revenue reduction, together with the associated carrying cost will occur in the regulatory year beginning April 1, 2016. Under GAAP, WPD does not record a receivable for under recovery of regulated income (which this reduction represents), as a result earnings for the U.K. Regulated segment were adversely affected by $15 million in 2015 and $31 million in 2014. PPL projects earnings in 2016 will be positively affected by $32 million and earnings for 2017 will be positively affected by $17 million.\nU.K. Tax Rate Change\nIn November 2015, the U.K. Summer 2015 Budget was enacted, which reduces the U.K.'s statutory income tax rate from 20% to 19% effective April 1, 2017 and from 19% to 18% effective April 1, 2020. As a result of these changes, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a deferred tax benefit of approximately $90 million (4% effective tax rate impact) in 2015.\nDiscount Rate Change for U.K. Pension Plans\nIn selecting the discount rate for its U.K. pension plans, WPD historically used a single weighted-average discount rate in the calculation of net periodic defined benefit cost. WPD will begin using individual spot rates to measure service cost and interest cost beginning with the calculation of 2016 net periodic defined benefit cost. Based on current estimates, PPL expects this change to reduce net periodic defined benefit costs by $44 million ($36 million after-tax or $0.05 per share) in 2016. Assuming interest rates continue to rise, the benefit is highest in the initial year and then falls over time as the additional actuarial losses on liabilities are amortized. See \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies-Defined Benefits\" for additional information.\n(PPL and PPL Electric)\nRate Case Proceedings\nOn March 31, 2015, PPL Electric filed a request with the PUC to increase its annual distribution revenue requirement by approximately $167.5 million. The application is based on a fully projected future test year of January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. On September 3, 2015, PPL Electric filed with the PUC Administrative Law Judge a petition for approval of a settlement agreement resolving all issues in the case. On November 19, 2015, the PUC issued its final order approving the settlement agreement. Under that agreement, PPL Electric was permitted to increase its annual distribution rates by $124 million, effective January 1, 2016.\nOn March 31, 2015, PPL Electric filed a petition requesting a waiver of the DSIC cap of 5% of billed revenues and approval to increase the maximum allowable DSIC from 5% to 7.5% for service rendered after January 1, 2016. PPL Electric filed the petition concurrently with its 2015 rate case and the Administrative Law Judge granted PPL Electric's request to consolidate these two proceedings. Under the terms of the settlement agreement discussed above, PPL Electric agreed to withdraw the petition without prejudice to filing it at a later date.\nRegional Transmission Expansion Plan\nIn July 2014, PPL Electric announced Project Compass, a proposal to construct a new multi-state transmission line. On October 27, 2015, PPL Electric filed an interconnection application with the New York Independent System Operator for the first segment of the project which contains a proposed 95-mile, $500 million to $600 million line between Blakely, Pennsylvania, and Ramapo, New York. The proposed line is intended to provide significant economic benefits for electricity customers in New York and also to provide grid reliability and grid security benefits for electricity customers in both states. The construction is proposed to begin in 2019 and be in operation by 2023. There will be numerous approvals required, including, among others, the public utility commissions of Pennsylvania and New York, the New York Independent System Operator, PJM, and FERC. As originally proposed in 2014, Project Compass would have run from western Pennsylvania into New York and New Jersey and also south into Maryland, covering approximately 725 miles at an estimated cost of $4 billion to $6 billion. The project has been revised to include about 475 miles of transmission line in Pennsylvania and New York at an estimated cost of $3 billion to $4 billion. Beyond this segment, no schedule is proposed for the rest of the project. There can be no assurance that this segment of Project Compass will be approved as proposed. Additionally, PPL Electric is\nTable 229: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\ncontinuing to study the project and may modify it in the future. The capital expenditures related to this project are excluded from the Capital Expenditures table included in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Forecasted Uses of Cash\" below.\nFERC Wholesale Formula Rates (LKE and KU)\nIn September 2013, KU filed an application with the FERC to adjust the formula rate under which KU provided wholesale requirements power sales to 12 municipal customers. Among other changes, the application requests an amended formula whereby KU would charge cost-based rates with a subsequent true-up to actual costs, replacing the current formula which does not include a true-up. KU's application proposed an authorized return on equity of 10.7%. Certain elements, including the new formula rate, became effective April 23, 2014, subject to refund. In April 2014, nine municipalities submitted notices of termination, under the original notice period provisions, to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements contracts. Such terminations are to be effective in 2019, except in the case of one municipality with a 2017 effective date. In addition, a tenth municipality has become a transmission-only customer as of June 2015. In July 2014, KU agreed on settlement terms with the two municipal customers that did not provide termination notices and filed the settlement proposal with the FERC for its approval. In August 2014, the FERC issued an order on the interim settlement agreement allowing the proposed rates to become effective pending a final order. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the FERC approved the settlement agreement resolving the rate case with respect to these two municipalities, including approval of the formula rate with a true-up provision and authorizing a return on equity of 10% or the return on equity awarded to other parties in this case, whichever is lower. In August 2015, KU filed a partial settlement agreement with the nine terminating municipalities, resolving all but one open matter with one municipality. The settlement was approved by FERC in the fourth quarter of 2015, including authorizing the agreed-upon refunds, approving the formula rate with a true-up provision, and authorizing a 10.25% return on equity. Refunds to both the remaining municipals and the departing municipals were issued during the fourth quarter of 2015 totaling $3.4 million. A single remaining unresolved issue with one terminating municipality is in FERC litigation proceedings. Hearings on the dispute were conducted in January 2016 and preliminary rulings on the matter may occur in mid- or late-2016. KU cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this remaining FERC proceeding, but the amounts under continuing dispute are not estimated to be significant.\nRate Case Proceedings (LKE, LG&E and KU)\nOn June 30, 2015, the KPSC approved a rate case settlement agreement providing for increases in the annual revenue requirements associated with KU base electricity rates of $125 million and LG&E base gas rates of $7 million. The annual revenue requirement associated with base electricity rates at LG&E was not changed. Although the settlement did not establish a specific return on equity with respect to the base rates, an authorized 10% return on equity will be utilized in the ECR and GLT mechanisms. The settlement agreement provides for deferred recovery of costs associated with KU's retirement of Green River Units 3 and 4. The new regulatory asset will be amortized over three years. The settlement also provides regulatory asset treatment for the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with LG&E and KU's pension accounting policy and pension expense using a 15 year amortization period for actuarial gains and losses. The new rates and all elements of the settlement became effective July 1, 2015.\nOn June 30, 2015, KU filed an application with the VSCC to increase annual Virginia base electricity revenue by approximately $7 million, representing an increase of 10.1%. On December 3, 2015, KU and other parties filed a proposed settlement with the VSCC. On February 2, 2016, the VSCC issued an order approving the settlement. The settlement provides for annual electric base revenues of $6 million and establishes an authorized return on equity range of 9.5% to 10.5% for annual rate review purposes. The new rates became effective February 15, 2016.\nResults of Operations\n(PPL)\nThe discussion for PPL provides a review of results by reportable segment. The \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" discussion provides explanations of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The \"Statement of Income Analysis\" discussion addresses significant changes in principal line items on PPL's Statements of Income, comparing year-to-year changes. \"Segment Earnings, Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Statement of Income Analysis\" is presented separately for PPL.\nTables analyzing changes in amounts between periods within \"Segment Earnings\" and \"Statement of Income Analysis\" are presented on a constant U.K. foreign currency exchange rate basis, where applicable, in order to isolate the impact of the change in the exchange rate on the item being explained. Results computed on a constant U.K. foreign currency exchange\nTable 230: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nrate basis are calculated by translating current year results at the prior year weighted-average U.K. foreign currency exchange rate.\n(Subsidiary Registrants)\nThe discussion for each of PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU provides a summary of earnings. The \"Margins\" discussion includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to \"Operating Income\" and \"Statement of Income Analysis\" addresses significant changes in principal line items on the Statements of Income comparing year-to-year changes. \"Earnings, Margins and Statement of Income Analysis\" are presented separately for PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU.\nPPL Segment Earnings, Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Statement of Income Analysis\nSegment Earnings\nU.K. Regulated Segment\nThe U.K. Regulated segment consists of PPL Global which primarily includes WPD's regulated electricity distribution operations, the results of hedging the translation of WPD's earnings from British pound sterling to U.S. dollars, and certain costs, such as U.S. income taxes, administrative costs, and allocated financing costs.

PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's fundamental earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. PPL's management also uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring certain corporate performance goals. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance. Earnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items as described below, which for all years includes the Supply segment's earnings now reflected in discontinued operations. Also included in special items in 2015 is the loss on spinoff, reflecting the fair value of the Supply segment being less than PPL's recorded value as of the June 1, 2015 spinoff. Earnings from Ongoing Operations for 2014 and 2013 also reflects, within the Corporate and Other category, the impact of spinoff dissynergies that, if not mitigated, would remain with PPL after completion of the spinoff.\nTable 277: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEarnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items include:\n\u2022 Unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency-related economic hedges.\n\u2022 Supply segment discontinued operations.\n\u2022 Gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business.\n\u2022 Impairment charges.\n\u2022 Workforce reduction and other restructuring effects.\n\u2022 Acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments.\n\u2022 Other charges or credits that are, in management's view, not reflective of the company's ongoing operations.\nReconciliation of Earnings from Ongoing Operations\nThe following tables contain after-tax gains

The increases in base rates were the result of new rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2015. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in volumes of $28 million ($23 million at KU and $5 million at LG&E) primarily due to milder weather during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nKentucky Gross Margins increased in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to returns on additional environmental capital investments of $55 million ($27 million at LG&E and $28 million at KU) and higher volumes of $13 million ($5 million at LG&E and $8 million at KU). The change in volumes was driven by unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014.\nPennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins\nDistribution\nDistribution margins increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to returns on additional distribution improvement capital investments of $17 million partially offset by a $12 million benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2014 as a result of a change in estimate of a regulatory liability.\nDistribution margins increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to returns on additional distribution improvement capital investments of $18 million and a $12 million benefit from a change in estimate of a regulatory liability.\nTransmission\nTransmission margins increased for both periods, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments focused on replacing the aging infrastructure and improving reliability.\nTable 294: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nStatement of Income Analysis --\nCertain

The increases in base rates were the result of new rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2015. The change in sales volume was due to milder weather during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nEarnings in 2014 compared with 2013 decreased primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expense driven by the timing and scope of scheduled generation maintenance outages, higher bad debt expense, storm-related expenses, higher financing costs and higher depreciation expense partially offset by returns on additional environmental capital investments and higher sales volumes. The changes in sales volumes were driven by unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014.\nThe table below quantifies the changes in the components of Net Income between these periods, which reflect amounts classified as Margins and certain items that management considers special on separate lines within the table and not in their respective Statement of Income line items.

partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and lower sales volume. The increases in base rates were the result of new rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2015. The change in sales volume were due to milder weather during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nExcluding special items, earnings in 2014 compared with 2013 decreased primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expense driven by the timing and scope of scheduled generation maintenance outages, higher financing costs and higher depreciation expense partially offset by returns on additional environmental capital investments and higher sales volumes. The changes in sales volumes were driven by unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014.\nThe table below quantifies the changes in the components of Net Income between these periods, which reflect amounts classified as Margins and certain items that management considers special on separate lines within the table and not in their respective Statement of Income line items.

These bonds continue to experience failed auctions and the interest rate continues to be set by a formula pursuant to the relevant indentures. For the period ended December 31, 2015, the weighted-average rate on LG&E's and KU's auction rate bonds in total was 0.22% (0.20% at LG&E and 0.24% at KU).\nForecasted Sources of Cash\n(All Registrants)\nThe Registrants expect to continue to have adequate liquidity available from operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities and commercial paper issuances. Additionally, subject to market conditions, the Registrants and their subsidiaries may access the capital markets, and PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU anticipate receiving equity contributions from their parent or member in 2016.\nCredit Facilities\nThe Registrants maintain credit facilities to enhance liquidity, provide credit support and provide a backstop to commercial paper programs. Amounts borrowed under these credit facilities are reflected in \"Short-term debt\" on the Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2015, the total committed borrowing capacity under credit facilities and the use of this borrowing capacity were:\nTable 426: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nExternal\nTable 427: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Letters of </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Credit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>and </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Committed </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Paper </td> <td> </td> <td>Unused </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Capacity </td> <td> </td> <td>Borrowed </td> <td> </td> <td>Issued </td> <td> </td> <td>Capacity </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>PPL Capital Funding Credit Facilities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>471 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>279 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>PPL Electric Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>299 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>LKE Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>LG&E Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>358 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>KU Credit Facilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>352 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total LKE Consolidated </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>388 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>710 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Total U.S. Credit Facilities (a) (b) (c) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,223 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>860 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,288 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total U.K. Credit Facilities (c) (d) (e) </td> <td> </td> <td>\u00a3 </td> <td>1,055 </td> <td> </td> <td>\u00a3 </td> <td>133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\u00a3 </td> <td>922 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 428: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(a) </td> <td>The syndicated credit facilities, as well as KU's letter of credit facility, each contain a financial covenant requiring debt to total capitalization not to exceed 70% for PPL Capital Funding, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU, as calculated in accordance with the facility, and other customary covenants. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 429: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(b) </td> <td>The commitments under the domestic credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group, with no one bank and its affiliates providing an aggregate commitment of more than the following percentages of the total committed capacity: PPL - 13%, PPL Electric - 12%, LKE - 21%, LG&E - 12% and KU - 37%. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 430: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(c) </td> <td>Each company pays customary fees under its respective syndicated credit facility, as does KU under its letter of credit facility, and borrowings generally bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus an applicable margin. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 431: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(d) </td> <td>The facilities contain financial covenants to maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 times consolidated earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization and total net debt not in excess of 85% of its RAV, calculated in accordance with the credit facility. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 432: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(e) </td> <td>At December 31, 2015, the unused capacity under the U.K. committed credit facilities was approximately $1.4 billion.

In November 2015, PPL declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable January 4, 2016, at 37.75 cents per share (equivalent to $1.51 per annum). On February 4, 2016, PPL announced that the company is increasing its common stock dividend to 38 cents per share on a quarterly basis (equivalent to $1.52 per annum). Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other relevant factors at the time. Subject to certain exceptions, PPL may not declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067 or 2013 Series B Junior Subordinated Notes due 2073. At December 31, 2015, no interest payments were deferred.\nSee Note 8 for information regarding the June 1, 2015 distribution to PPL's shareowners of a newly formed entity, Holdco, which at closing owned all of the membership interests of PPL Energy Supply and all of the common stock of Talen Energy.\n(PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nFrom time to time, as determined by their respective Board of Directors or Board of Managers, the Registrants pay dividends or distributions, as applicable, to their respective shareholders or members. Certain of the credit facilities of PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU include minimum debt covenant ratios that could effectively restrict the payment of dividends or distributions.\n(All Registrants)\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for these and other restrictions related to distributions on capital interests for the Registrants and their subsidiaries.\nPurchase or Redemption of Debt Securities\nThe Registrants will continue to evaluate outstanding debt securities and may decide to purchase or redeem these securities in open market or privately negotiated transactions, in exchange transactions or otherwise, depending upon prevailing market conditions, available cash and other factors, and may be commenced or suspended at any time. The amounts involved may be material.\nRating Agency Actions\nMoody's, S&P and Fitch periodically review the credit ratings of the debt of the Registrants and their subsidiaries. Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations.\nA credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the Registrants and other sources. The ratings of Moody's, S&P and Fitch are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the Registrants or their subsidiaries. Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities.\nThe credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowing under their credit facilities. A downgrade in the Registrants' or their subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. The Registrants and their subsidiaries have no credit rating triggers that would result in the reduction of access to capital markets or the acceleration of maturity dates of outstanding debt.\nThe following table sets forth the Registrants' and their subsidiaries' credit ratings for outstanding debt securities or commercial paper programs as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 456: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 457: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Senior Unsecured </td> <td> </td> <td>Senior Secured </td> <td> </td> <td>Commercial Paper </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Issuer </td> <td> </td> <td>Moody's </td> <td> </td> <td>S&P </td> <td> </td> <td>Moody's </td> <td> </td> <td>S&P </td> <td> </td> <td>Moody's </td> <td> </td> <td>S&P </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>PPL </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>PPL Capital Funding </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa2 </td> <td> </td> <td> BBB+ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>P-2 </td> <td> </td> <td>A-2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>WPD plc </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa3 </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB+ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>WPD (East Midlands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa1 </td> <td> </td> <td>A- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>WPD (West Midlands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa1 </td> <td> </td> <td>A- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>WPD (South Wales) </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa1 </td> <td> </td> <td>A- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>WPD (South West) </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa1 </td> <td> </td> <td>A- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>PPL and PPL Electric </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>PPL Electric </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>A1 </td> <td> </td> <td>A </td> <td> </td> <td>P-2 </td> <td> </td> <td>A-2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>PPL and LKE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>LKE </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa1 </td> <td> </td> <td> BBB+ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>LG&E </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>A1 </td> <td> </td> <td>A </td> <td> </td> <td>P-2 </td> <td> </td> <td>A-2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>KU </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>A1 </td> <td> </td> <td>A </td> <td> </td> <td>P-2 </td> <td> </td> <td>A-2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe rating agencies have taken the following actions related to the Registrants and their subsidiaries.\nIn January 2015, Fitch withdrew its ratings for PPL, PPL Capital Funding, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E, and KU.\n(PPL)\nIn May 2015, Moody's upgraded the following ratings with a stable outlook:\nTable 458: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the long-term issuer rating from Baa3 to Baa2 for PPL;

A restructuring event includes the loss of, or a material adverse change to, the distribution licenses under which WPD (East Midlands), WPD (South West), WPD (South Wales) and WPD (West Midlands) operate and would be a trigger event for each company. These notes totaled \u00a34.4 billion (approximately $6.6 billion) nominal value at December 31, 2015.\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nVarious derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, interest rate and foreign currency instruments (for PPL), contain provisions that require the posting of additional collateral, or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if PPL's, LKE's, LG&E's or KU's or their subsidiaries' credit rating, as applicable, were to fall below investment grade.

At this time, PPL believes that these covenants will not limit access to relevant funding sources. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information about guarantees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants have entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these agreements.\nRisk Management\nMarket Risk\n(All Registrants)\nSee Notes 1, 16, and 17 to the Financial Statements for information about the Registrants' risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations.\nThe forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions. Actual future results may differ materially from those presented. These disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Registrants and their subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. The Registrants and their subsidiaries utilize various financial derivative instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of their debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolios due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates.\nThe following interest rate hedges were outstanding at December 31.\nTable 478: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014

Under its risk management program, PPL may enter into financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including translation risk of expected earnings, firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions and net investments.\nThe following foreign currency hedges were outstanding at December 31.\nTable 486: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Effect of a 10% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Effect of a 10% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value, </td> <td> </td> <td>Adverse Movement </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value, </td> <td> </td> <td>Adverse Movement </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Exposure </td> <td> </td> <td>Net - Asset </td> <td> </td> <td>in Foreign Currency </td> <td> </td> <td>Ranging </td> <td> </td> <td>Exposure </td> <td> </td> <td>Net - Asset </td> <td> </td> <td>in Foreign Currency </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Hedged </td> <td> </td> <td>(Liability) </td> <td> </td> <td>Exchange Rates (a) </td> <td> </td> <td>Through </td> <td> </td> <td>Hedged </td> <td> </td> <td>(Liability) </td> <td> </td> <td>Exchange Rates (a) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net investment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>hedges (b) </td> <td> </td> <td>\u00a3 </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>\u00a3 </td> <td>217 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(34) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Economic </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>hedges (c) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(246) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(193) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 487: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(a) </td> <td>Effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 488: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(b) </td> <td>To protect the value of a portion of its net investment in WPD, PPL executes forward contracts to sell GBP. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 489: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(c) </td> <td>To economically hedge the translation of expected earnings denominated in GBP. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommodity Price Risk (Non-trading)\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nLG&E's and KU's retail electric rates, LG&E's natural gas rates and KU's municipal wholesale electric rates are set by regulatory commissions and the fuel costs incurred are directly recoverable from customers. As a result, LG&E and KU are subject to commodity price risk for only a small portion of their business operations. LG&E and KU sell excess economic generation to maximize the value of the physical assets at times when the assets are not required to serve LG&E's or KU's customers. See Note 17 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\n(PPL and PPL Electric)\nPPL Electric is exposed to market price and volumetric risks from its obligation as a PLR. The PUC has approved a cost recovery mechanism that allows PPL Electric to pass through to customers the cost associated with fulfilling its PLR obligation. This cost recovery mechanism substantially eliminates PPL Electric's exposure to market price risk. PPL Electric also mitigates its exposure to volumetric risk by entering into full-requirement energy supply contracts for the majority of its PLR obligations. These supply contracts transfer the volumetric risk associated with the PLR obligation to the energy suppliers.\nTable 490: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(All Registrants)\nDefined Benefit Plans - Securities Price Risk\nSee \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Defined Benefits\" for additional information regarding the effect of securities price risk on plan assets.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk that the Registrants would incur a loss as a result of nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual obligations. The Registrants maintain credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparty credit (including requirements that counterparties maintain specified credit ratings) and require other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk. However, the Registrants, as applicable, have concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities, financial institutions and energy marketing and trading companies. These concentrations may impact the Registrants' overall exposure to credit risk, positively or negatively, as counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions.\n(PPL and PPL Electric)\nIn 2013, the PUC approved PPL Electric's PLR procurement plan for the period of June 2013 through May 2015. To date, PPL Electric has conducted all of its planned competitive solicitations. In 2014, PPL Electric filed a request with the PUC for approval of PPL Electric's PLR procurement plan for the period of June 2015 through May 2017, which was approved in January 2015.\nUnder the standard Supply Master Agreement (the Agreement) for the competitive solicitation process, PPL Electric requires all suppliers to post collateral if their credit exposure exceeds an established credit limit. In the event a supplier defaults on its obligation, PPL Electric would be required to seek replacement power in the market. All incremental costs incurred by PPL Electric would be recoverable from customers in future rates. At December 31, 2015, most of the successful bidders under all of the solicitations had an investment grade credit rating from S&P, and were not required to post collateral under the Agreement. A small portion of bidders were required to post an insignificant amount of collateral under the Agreement. There is no instance under the Agreement in which PPL Electric is required to post collateral to its suppliers.\nSee Notes 14, 16 and 17 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the competitive solicitation process, the Agreement, credit concentration and credit risk.\nForeign Currency Translation (PPL)\nThe value of the British pound sterling fluctuates in relation to the U.S. dollar. In 2015, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $240 million, which primarily reflected a $589 million decrease to PP&E and goodwill offset by a decrease of $349 million to net liabilities. In 2014, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $290 million, which primarily reflected a $680 million decrease to PP&E and goodwill offset by a decrease of $390 million to net liabilities. In 2013, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $150 million, which primarily reflected a $330 million increase to PP&E and goodwill offset by an increase of $180 million to net liabilities. The impact of foreign currency translation is recorded in AOCI.\n(All Registrants)\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Registrants are not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other entities doing business with the Registrants. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information on related party transactions for PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU.\nAcquisitions, Development and Divestitures\nThe Registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures and development projects. Development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with,\nTable 491: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nmodify or terminate the projects. Any resulting transactions may impact future financial results. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for information on the more significant activities.\n(PPL)\nSee Note 8 to the Financial Statements for information on the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply.\nEnvironmental Matters\n(All Registrants)\nExtensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to PPL's, LKE's, LG&E's and KU's air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, as well as other aspects of the Registrants' businesses. The cost of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be significant. In addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed. Costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions. Many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the cost for their products or their demand for the Registrants' services. Increased capital and operating and maintenance expenses are subject to rate recovery. PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities.\nSee Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the more significant environmental matters including:\nTable 492: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Legal Matters, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 493: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Climate Change, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 494: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Coal Combustion Residuals, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 495: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Effluent Limitations Guidelines, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 496: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 497: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>National Ambient Air Quality Standards, and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 498: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Superfund and Other Remediation. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally, see \"Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters\" for additional information on environmental matters.\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nCoal Combustion Residuals (CCRs)\nIn October 2015, the EPA's final rule regulating CCRs became effective. In connection with the final CCR rule, LG&E and KU recorded increases to existing AROs of $228 million during 2015. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information. Further increases to AROs or changes to current capital plans or to operating costs may be required as estimates are refined based on closure developments, groundwater monitoring results and regulatory or legal proceedings. See Note 6 for details surrounding the CPCN and ECR filings that request rate recovery of the costs related to this rule.\n(All Registrants)\nCompetition\nSee \"Competition\" under each of PPL's reportable segments in \"Item 1. Business - General - Segment Information\" and \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of competitive factors affecting the Registrants.\nNew Accounting Guidance\nSee Notes 1 and 21 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting guidance adopted and pending adoption.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nFinancial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. The following accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of the reported financial condition or results of operations, and require management to make estimates or other judgments of\nTable 499: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nmatters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements). Senior management has reviewed with PPL's Audit Committee these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application and the estimates and assumptions regarding them.\nPrice Risk Management (PPL)\nSee \"Price Risk Management\" in Note 1 to the Financial Statements, as well as \"Financial Condition - Risk Management\" above.\nDefined Benefits\n(All Registrants)\nCertain of the Registrants' subsidiaries sponsor or participate in, as applicable, various qualified funded and non-qualified unfunded defined benefit pension plans and both funded and unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. These plans are applicable to the majority of the Registrants' employees (based on eligibility for their applicable plans). The Registrants and certain of their subsidiaries record an asset or liability to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to AOCI or in the case of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the Balance Sheets. See Notes 6 and 11 to the Financial Statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits.\nA summary of plan sponsors by Registrant and whether a Registrant or its subsidiaries sponsor (S) or participate in and receives allocations (P) from those plans is shown in the table below.\nTable 500: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Plan Sponsor </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>PPL </td> <td> </td> <td>PPL Electric </td> <td> </td> <td>LKE </td> <td> </td> <td>LG&E </td> <td> </td> <td>KU </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>PPL Services </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>S </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>P </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>WPD (a) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>S </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>LKE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>S </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>P </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>P </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>LG&E </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>S </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 501: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(a) </td> <td>Does not sponsor or participate in other postretirement benefits plans. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. As such, annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings or regulatory assets based on estimated results. Any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in AOCI, or in the case of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, regulatory assets and liabilities, for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. These amounts in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods. The delayed recognition allows for a smoothed recognition of costs over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans. The primary assumptions are:\nTable 502: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Discount Rate - The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 503: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Expected Return on Plan Assets - Management projects the long-term rates of return on plan assets that will be earned over the life of the plan.

At December 31, 2014, the plan sponsors adopted the new mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries in October 2014 (RP-2014 base tables) for all U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. In addition, plan sponsors updated the basis for estimating projected mortality improvements and selected the IRS BB-2D two-dimensional improvement scale on a generational basis for all U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. These new mortality assumptions reflect the recognition of both improved life expectancies and the expectation of continuing improvements in life expectancies. The use of the new base tables and improvement scale resulted in an increase to U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, an increase to future expense and a decrease to funded status.\n(PPL)\nIn selecting the discount rate for its U.K. pension plans, WPD starts with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its plans. These plan-specific cash flows are matched against a spot-rate yield curve to determine the assumed discount rate. The spot-rate yield curve uses an iBoxx British pounds sterling denominated corporate bond index as its base. From this base, those bonds with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds. Historically, WPD used the single weighted-average discount rate derived from the spot rates used to discount the benefit obligation. Concurrent with the annual remeasurement of plan assets and obligations at December 31, 2015, WPD will begin using individual spot rates to measure service cost and interest cost beginning with the calculation of 2016 net periodic defined benefit cost.\nAn individual bond matching approach, which is used for the U.S. pension plans as discussed below, is not used for the U.K. pension plans because the universe of bonds in the U.K. is not deep enough to adequately support such an approach.\n(All Registrants)\nIn selecting the discount rates for U.S. defined benefit plans, the plan sponsors start with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans. The plan-specific cash flows are matched against the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. This bond matching process begins with the full universe of Aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds, serving as the base from which those with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds. Individual bonds are then selected based on the timing of each plan's cash flows and parameters are established as to the percentage of each individual bond issue that could be hypothetically purchased and the surplus reinvestment rates to be assumed.\nTo determine the expected return on plan assets, plan sponsors project the long-term rates of return on plan assets using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. Each plan's specific current and expected asset allocations are also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption.\nIn selecting a rate of compensation increase, plan sponsors consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates.\nThe following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used for discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase at December 31.\nTable 507: <table> <tr> <td>Assumption / Registrant </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Discount rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Pension - PPL (U.S.) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.59% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.25% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Pension - PPL (U.K.) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.68% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.85% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Pension - LKE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.56% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.25% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Pension - LG&E </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.49% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.20% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Other Postretirement - PPL </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.48% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.09% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Other Postretirement - LKE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.49% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.06% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected return on plan assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Pension - PPL (U.S.) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.00% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.00% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Pension - PPL (U.K.) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.20% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.19% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Pension - LKE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.00% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.00% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Pension - LG&E </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.00% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.00% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Other Postretirement - PPL </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.11% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.06% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Other Postretirement - LKE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.82% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.85% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 508: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 509: <table> <tr> <td>Assumption / Registrant </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rate of compensation increase </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Pension - PPL (U.S.) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.93% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.91% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Pension - PPL (U.K.) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.00% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.00% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Pension - LKE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.50% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.50% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Other Postretirement - PPL </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.91% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.86% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Other Postretirement - LKE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.50% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.50% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn selecting health care cost trend rates, plan sponsors consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs.

</tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill Impairment (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. PPL has determined its reporting units to be at the same level as its reportable segments. LKE, LG&E and KU each operate within a single reportable segment and single reporting unit. A goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may be greater than the reporting unit's fair value. Additionally, goodwill is tested for impairment after a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed of.\nPPL, LKE, LG&E and KU may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a two-step quantitative test. If the qualitative evaluation (referred to as \"step zero\") is elected and the assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is not necessary.\nWhen the two-step quantitative impairment test is elected or required as a result of the step zero assessment, in step one, PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU determine whether a potential impairment exists by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill, on the measurement date. If the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.\nThe second step of the quantitative test requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination. That is, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill.\nPPL elected to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test of goodwill for all its reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2015. Management used both discounted cash flows and market multiples, which required significant assumptions, to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows include discount and growth rates, outcomes of future rate filings, projected operating and capital cash flows and the fair value of debt. Projected operating and capital cash flows is based on PPL's internal business plan, which assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future. Significant assumptions used in the market multiples include utility sector market performance and comparable transactions.\nGoodwill was $3.6 billion at December 31, 2015, which consists of $2.9 billion related to the acquisition of WPD and $662 million related to the acquisition of LKE. Applying an appropriate weighting to both the discounted cash flow and market\nTable 519: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nmultiple valuations for the most recent impairment tests performed as of October 1, 2015, did not require the second-step assessment and did not result in any impairment.\nA high degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to fair value conclusions. A decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10%, an increase in the discount rate by 0.25%, or a 10% decrease in the market multiples would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill for these reporting units.\nLoss Accruals (All Registrants)\nLosses are accrued for the estimated impacts of various conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain or contingent future outcomes. For loss contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of the uncertain future outcomes, and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting guidance defines \"probable\" as cases in which \"the future event or events are likely to occur.\" The accrual of contingencies that might result in gains is not recorded unless recovery is assured. Potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other events are continuously assessed.\nThe accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include (1) the initial identification and recording of the loss, (2) the determination of triggering events for reducing a recorded loss accrual, and (3) the ongoing assessment as to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient. All three of these aspects require significant judgment by management. Internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers and engineers) are consulted, as necessary, to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss.\nCertain other events have been identified that could give rise to a loss, but that do not meet the conditions for accrual. Such events are disclosed, but not recorded, when it is \"reasonably possible\" that a loss has been incurred. Accounting guidance defines \"reasonably possible\" as cases in which \"the future event or events occurring is more than remote, but less than likely to occur.\"\nWhen an estimated loss is accrued, the triggering events for subsequently adjusting the loss accrual are identified, where applicable. The triggering events generally occur when new information becomes known, the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is settled or written off, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated. The following are some of the triggering events that provide for the adjustment of certain recorded loss accruals:\nTable 520: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted, a better estimate of the allowance is determined or underlying amounts are ultimately collected. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 521: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Environmental and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is resolved and actual payments are made, a better estimate of the loss is determined or the loss is no longer considered probable. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 522: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Actions or decisions by certain regulators could result in a better estimate of a previously recorded loss accrual. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss accruals are reviewed on a regular basis to assure that the recorded probable loss exposures are appropriate. This involves ongoing communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel, engineers, business unit management and other parties.\nSee Notes 6 and 13 to the Financial Statements for disclosure of loss contingencies accrued and other potential loss contingencies that have not met the criteria for accrual.\nAsset Retirement Obligations (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nARO liabilities are required to be recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. The initial obligation is measured at its estimated fair value. An ARO must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated. An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset. For LG&E and KU, costs of removal are collected in rates, and therefore the accretion and depreciation expenses related to an ARO are recorded as a regulatory asset, such that there is no earnings impact.\nSee Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information on AROs.\nTable 523: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value. Fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that consider estimated retirement costs in current period dollars that are inflated to the anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred. Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the ARO. Any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.\nAt December 31, 2015, the total recorded balances and information on the most significant recorded AROs were as follows.\nTable 524: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Most Significant AROs </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>ARO </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Recorded </td> <td> </td> <td>Recorded </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Description </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>PPL </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>586 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>430 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ash ponds, landfills and natural gas mains </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 525: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>LKE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>430 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ash ponds, landfills and natural gas mains </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>LG&E </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ash ponds, landfills and natural gas mains </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>KU </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td>Ash ponds and landfills </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe most significant assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted retirement costs (including the settlement dates and the timing of cash flows), the discount rates and the inflation rates. At December 31, 2015, a 10% change to retirement cost would increase the ARO liabilities by $44 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase the ARO liabilities by $6 million and a 0.25% increase in the inflation rate would increase the ARO liabilities by $6 million. For PPL, there would be no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the ARO asset or the annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as a result of these changes in assumptions. As noted above, these factors do not impact the Statements of Income of LKE, LG&E and KU.\nIncome Taxes (All Registrants)\nSignificant management judgment is required in developing the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and whether the undistributed earnings of WPD are considered indefinitely reinvested.\nSignificant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position. Tax positions are evaluated following a two-step process. The first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained. This determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position. The second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion. The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds 50%. Management considers a number of factors in assessing the benefit to be recognized, including negotiation of a settlement.\nOn a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known as of the reporting date. Based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be derecognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future. Unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current to the extent management expects to settle an uncertain tax position by payment or receipt of cash within one year of the reporting date.\nAt December 31, 2015, no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits are projected over the next 12 months.\nThe need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also require significant management judgment. Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. Management considers a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position. Management also considers the uncertainty posed by political risk and the effect of\nTable 526: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nthis uncertainty on the various factors that management takes into account in evaluating the need for valuation allowances. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.\nSee Note 5 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures, including management's conclusion that the undistributed earnings of WPD are considered indefinitely reinvested. Based on this conclusion, PPL Global does not record U.S. income taxes on WPD's undistributed earnings.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\n(PPL)\nWPD operates in an incentive-based regulatory structure under distribution licenses granted by Ofgem. As the regulatory model is incentive-based rather than a cost recovery model, WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP for entities subject to cost-based rate regulation. Therefore, the accounting treatment of adjustments to base demand revenue and/or allowed revenue is evaluated based on revenue recognition and contingency guidance. See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\n(All Registrants)\nPPL Electric, LG&E and KU, are subject to cost-based rate regulation. As a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements. Assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose.\nManagement continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset would be written-off. Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of recovery of regulatory assets.\nAt December 31, 2015, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities were recorded as reflected in the table below. All regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices.\nTable 527: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>PPL </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>PPL </td> <td> </td> <td>Electric </td> <td> </td> <td>LKE </td> <td> </td> <td>LG&E </td> <td> </td> <td>KU </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Regulatory assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,781 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>762 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>440 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>322 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Regulatory liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>511 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information on regulatory assets and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenue (PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nRevenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual meter reads taken throughout the month, estimates are recorded for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. For LG&E and KU, such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of deliveries to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. The unbilled revenue estimates reflect consideration of factors including daily load models, estimated usage for each customer class, the effect of current and different rate schedules, the meter read schedule, the billing schedule, actual weather data and where applicable, the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures. For PPL Electric, unbilled revenue amounts reflect actual deliveries since the date of the last billed meter reading multiplied by the estimated average cents per kWh. At December 31, unbilled revenues recorded on the Balance Sheets were as follows.\nTable 528: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 529: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>PPL Electric </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 530: <table> <tr> <td>LKE </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>167 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>LG&E </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>KU </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Information (All Registrants)\nPPL's Audit Committee has approved the independent auditor to provide audit and audit-related services, tax services and other services permitted by Sarbanes-Oxley and SEC rules.

In Kentucky, the KPSC has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ECR, DSM, GLT, fuel adjustment clause, gas supply clause and recovery on construction work-in-progress) that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In addition, the KPSC requires a utility to obtain a CPCN prior to constructing a facility, unless the construction is an ordinary extension of existing facilities in the usual course of business or does not involve sufficient capital outlay to materially affect the utility's financial condition. Although such KPSC proceedings do not directly address cost recovery issues, the KPSC, in awarding a CPCN, concludes that the public convenience and necessity require the construction of the facility on the basis that the facility is the lowest reasonable cost alternative for addressing the need. In Pennsylvania, the FERC transmission formula rate, DSIC mechanism, Smart Meter Rider and other recovery mechanisms are in place to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on prudently incurred costs.\n\n (a) Primarily represents financing and certain other costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, which are presented to reconcile segment information to PPL's consolidated results. 2015 and 2014 include costs related to the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply.

PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's fundamental earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. PPL's management also uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring certain corporate performance goals. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance. Earnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items as described below, which for all years includes the Supply segment's earnings now reflected in discontinued operations. Also included in special items in 2015 is the loss on spinoff, reflecting the fair value of the Supply segment being less than PPL's recorded value as of the June 1, 2015 spinoff.

In addition, the Registrants have financial and operational risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility, as applicable, related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and counterparty credit quality. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options, and swaps.\nCosts of Spinoff\nIn comparing 2015 with 2014, cash provided by financing activities decreased as a result of the repayment of short-term debt and lower capital contributions from LKE, partially offset by the $300 million of additional long-term debt issued in 2015.\nThe discussion for PPL provides a review of results by reportable segment. The \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" discussion provides explanations of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The \"Statement of Income Analysis\" discussion addresses significant changes in principal line items on PPL's Statements of Income, comparing year-to-year changes. \"Segment Earnings, Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Statement of Income Analysis\" is presented separately for PPL.\n\"Margins\" is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that management utilizes as an indicator of the performance of its business. See PPL's \"Results of Operations - Margins\" for an explanation of why management believes this measure is useful and the underlying drivers of the changes between periods.

Deferred income taxes were lower in 2015 as a large portion of the effect of accelerated tax depreciation did not result in cash as a result of the Federal net operating losses. \n (e) In 2013, WPD Midlands increased its line loss liability for DCPR4 based on additional information provided by Ofgem regarding the calculation.

See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u00b7 The increase in cash from changes in working capital was driven primarily by a decrease in income tax receivable as a result of receiving payment from LKE in 2015 for the use of excess tax depreciation deductions in 2014, a decrease in coal inventory as a result of the retirement of Green River coal units, and decreases in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to milder weather in December 2015, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable to affiliates compared to an increase in the prior year due to lower fuel costs for jointly owned units and a decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of fuel purchases and payments. \nIn addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as purchased power, payroll, fuel and taxes, the Registrants currently expect to incur future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations, payment of dividends on its common stock, distributions by LKE to their members, and possibly the purchase or redemption of a portion of debt securities.\nSee Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes.\n(KU)\nTable 361: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 vs. 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 vs. 2013 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Retail and wholesale </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(38) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Electric revenue from affiliate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(51) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Fuel </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(75) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Energy purchases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(64) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Energy purchases from affiliate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor PPL Electric, in 2015 compared with 2014, the increase in expenditures was primarily due to the Northeast Pocono reliability project, smart grid projects and other various projects, partially offset by the completion of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission project.\nTable 351: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Facilities\nIn selecting the discount rate for its U.K. pension plans, WPD historically used a single weighted-average discount rate in the calculation of net periodic defined benefit cost. WPD will begin using individual spot rates to measure service cost and interest cost beginning with the calculation of 2016 net periodic defined benefit cost. Based on current estimates, PPL expects this change to reduce net periodic defined benefit costs by $44 million ($36 million after-tax or $0.05 per share) in 2016. Assuming interest rates continue to rise, the benefit is highest in the initial year and then falls over time as the additional actuarial losses on liabilities are amortized. See \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies-Defined Benefits\" for additional information.\n (a) The increase in 2015 compared with 2014 is attributed to the change in mortality tables and lower discount rates. \nExternal\nTable 418: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>PPL </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

On October 27, 2015, PPL Electric filed an interconnection application with the New York Independent System Operator for the first segment of the project which contains a proposed 95-mile, $500 million to $600 million line between Blakely, Pennsylvania, and Ramapo, New York. The proposed line is intended to provide significant economic benefits for electricity customers in New York and also to provide grid reliability and grid security benefits for electricity customers in both states. The construction is proposed to begin in 2019 and be in operation by 2023. There will be numerous approvals required, including, among others, the public utility commissions of Pennsylvania and New York, the New York Independent System Operator, PJM, and FERC. As originally proposed in 2014, Project Compass would have run from western Pennsylvania into New York and New Jersey and also south into Maryland, covering approximately 725 miles at an estimated cost of $4 billion to $6 billion. The project has been revised to include about 475 miles of transmission line in Pennsylvania and New York at an estimated cost of $3 billion to $4 billion. Beyond this segment, no schedule is proposed for the rest of the project. There can be no assurance that this segment of Project Compass will be approved as proposed. Additionally, PPL Electric is\n \u00b7 The $148 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital was partially due to a decrease in taxes payable (primarily due an increase in current income tax benefits in 2015) and a decrease in accounts payable (primarily due to milder weather and lower energy prices in December 2015), partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable (primarily due to milder weather in 2015, improved collection performance and higher write-offs). \nTable 358: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Operating </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Margins </td> <td> </td> <td>Other (a) </td> <td> </td> <td>Income (b) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Fuel </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Energy purchases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Other operation and maintenance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Depreciation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Taxes, other than income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Operating Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>619 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>791 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(498) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLKE had a $79 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared with 2013.\n (e) The increase in 2015 compared with 2014 was due to the corporate costs allocated to PPL Energy Supply (and included in discontinued operations) prior to the spin.

These net non-cash charges included a $238 million decrease in deferred income taxes and $65 million of changes to the WPD line loss accrual. These decreases in non-cash charges were partially offset by $110 million of lower unrealized gains on hedging activities. The net $114 million decrease from net income and non-cash adjustments between the periods was primarily due to lower margins from the U.K. Regulated segment, partially offset by higher margins from the Kentucky and Pennsylvania Regulated segments. \n\"Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins\" is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that management utilizes as an indicator of the performance of its business.

The decrease in expenditures for KU was primarily due to lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7 and CCR projects at the Ghent and the E.W. Brown plants, partially offset by higher expenditures for environmental air projects at the Ghent and the E.W. Brown plants. The increase in expenditures for LG&E was primarily due to environmental air projects at the Mill Creek plant and the gas service riser program, partially offset by lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7.\nDistribution margins increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to returns on additional distribution improvement capital investments of $18 million and a $12 million benefit from a change in estimate of a regulatory liability.\nFollowing the announcement of the transaction to form Talen Energy, efforts were initiated to identify the appropriate staffing for Talen Energy and for PPL and its subsidiaries following completion of the spinoff. Organizational plans were substantially completed in 2014. The new organizational plans identified the need to resize and restructure the organizations and as a result, in 2014, estimated charges of $36 million for employee separation benefits were recorded related to 306 positions. Of this amount, $16 million related to 112 Energy Supply positions and is reflected in discontinued operations. The remaining $20 million is primarily reflected in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the PPL Consolidated Statements of Income.

Premiums for these transactions ranged from 5% to 42% with a median of approximately 25%. Given these metrics, PPL concluded a control premium of 25% to be reasonable for both of the market valuation approaches used.\n\n(PPL's Kentucky Regulated Segment and LKE, LG&E and KU)\nFollowing the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, PPL completed its strategic transformation to a fully regulated business model consisting of seven diverse, high-performing utilities. These utilities are located in the U.K., Pennsylvania and Kentucky and each jurisdiction has different regulatory structures and customer classes. The Company believes this diverse portfolio provides strong earnings and dividend growth potential that will create significant value for its shareowners and positions PPL well for continued growth and success.\nAssumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis included forward energy prices, forecasted generation, and forecasted operation and maintenance expenditures that were consistent with assumptions used in the Energy Supply portion of the recent Talen Energy business planning process and a market participant discount rate.\n \u00b7 LG&E's non-cash components of net income included a $92 million increase in deferred income taxes primarily due to an increase in accelerated tax depreciation over book depreciation as a result of additional assets in service in 2014. \n\nThe following after-tax loss, which management considers a special item, impacted the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's results and is excluded from Earnings from Ongoing Operations.\nAlso as a result of the environmental requirements discussed above, LKE projects $1.9 billion ($1.0 billion at KU and $0.9 billion at LG&E) in environmental capital investment over the next five years. See PPL's \"Financial Condition - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures\", Note 6 and Note 13 for additional information.\nIn conjunction with the accounting for the spinoff, PPL evaluated whether the fair value of the Supply segment's net assets was less than the carrying value as of the June 1, 2015 spinoff date.\n \u00b7 The decrease in cash from KU's other operating activities was driven primarily by $43 million in proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps received in 2013. \n \u00b7 Pension funding was $70 million lower in 2014. \nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for PPL's definition of Earnings from Ongoing Operations as well as a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to Net Income.\n \u00b7 The decrease in cash from LG&E's other operating activities was driven primarily by $43 million in proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps received in 2013. \nInterest expense increased by $5 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the issuance of $250 million of incremental First Mortgage Bonds in September 2015 and higher interest rates on $250 million of First Mortgage Bonds refinanced by KU.\nU.S.\n (a) Represents an inventory write-down and separation benefits. \nAlthough rate base growth in the domestic utilities is expected to result in strong earnings growth for the foreseeable future, PPL does not expect significant earnings growth from the U.K. Regulated segment under the RIIO-ED1 price control period, which began on April 1, 2015. Although the U.K. Regulated segment also projects strong RAV growth, earnings from this segment are expected to be relatively flat from 2015 to 2017 during the transition to RIIO-ED1. Higher revenues resulting from the fast-track bonus are partially offset by higher levels of revenue profiling in the prior price control period (DPCR5) and a lower return on regulatory equity. In addition, starting in 2017, the amount of incentive revenues WPD is able to earn is expected to decline as a result of more stringent reliability and customer service targets established by Ofgem under RIIO-ED1. See \"Item 1. Business - General - Segment Information - U.K. Regulated Segment\" for additional information on revenues under RIIO-ED1.\nThe Registrants had the following at:\n\nThe remainder of this Item 7 in this Form 10-K is presented on a combined basis, providing information, as applicable, for all Registrants.\nto timing of fuel purchases and payments and unfavorable weather in 2015) partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable (primarily due to unfavorable weather in 2015).\n \u00b7 The decrease in cash from KU's other operating activities was driven primarily by $44 million in payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps. \n (c) The increase in 2014 compared with 2013 was due to more storm events. \ndate) adjusted for the proportional share of the equity value attributable to the Supply segment, as well as the valuation methods consistently used in PPL's goodwill impairment assessments - an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis of the Supply segment and an alternative market approach considering market multiples of comparable companies.\n\n(All Registrants)\ncontinuing to study the project and may modify it in the future. The capital expenditures related to this project are excluded from the Capital Expenditures table included in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Forecasted Uses of Cash\" below.\nDuring 2013, PPL recorded $23 million of state deferred income tax expense related to a deferred tax valuation allowance primarily due to a decrease in projected future taxable income at PPL Energy Supply over the remaining carryforward period of Pennsylvania net operating losses.\nEarnings\n\nIn comparing 2014 with 2013, cash provided by financing activities decreased as a result of the $250 million long-term debt issued in November 2013, a decrease of contributions from LKE and higher dividends to LKE.\nMargins\n(All Registrants)\n (b) As reported on the Statements of Income. \n \u00b7 Net income decreased by $11 million between the periods and included an additional $181 million of net non-cash charges, primarily due to increases in deferred tax expense and depreciation. \n (c) Each company pays customary fees under its respective syndicated credit facility, as does KU under its letter of credit facility, and borrowings generally bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus an applicable margin. \n \u00b7 KU's non-cash components of net income included a $155 million increase in deferred income taxes primarily due to the utilization of net operating losses and an increase in accelerated tax depreciation over book depreciation as a result of additional assets in service in 2014. \nThe components of the change in cash provided by (used in) operating activities were as follows.\n\n (c) During 2015, PPL recorded a $12 million tax benefit related to the settlement of the IRS audit for the tax years 1998-2011. \n (b) Includes $5 million of Cane Run 7 operations partially offset by $2 million reduction of costs in 2015 due to the retirement of Green River units. \nExcluding a special item, earnings decreased for 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by returns on additional transmission and distribution improvement capital investments and the release of a gross receipts tax reserve.\nAs a result of the June 2014 spinoff announcement, PPL recorded $50 million of deferred income tax expense in 2014, to adjust valuation allowances on deferred tax assets primarily for state net operating loss carryforwards that were previously supported by the future earnings of PPL Energy Supply.\n (b) As reported on the Statements of Income. \nThe changes in the components of the U.K. Regulated segment's results between these periods were due to the factors set forth below, which reflect amounts classified as U.K. Gross Margins, the items that management considers special and the effects of movements in foreign currency exchange, including the effects of foreign currency hedge contracts, on separate lines and not in their respective Statement of Income line items.\n(PPL)\nExcluding a special item, earnings increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to returns on additional transmission and distribution improvement capital investments, lower other operation and maintenance expense and a benefit from a change in estimate of a regulatory liability, partially offset by higher interest expense and depreciation expense.\nThe businesses of LKE, LG&E and KU are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to CCRs, GHG, ELGs, MATS and the Clean Power Plan. See \"Financial Condition - Environmental Matters\" below for additional information on the CCRs requirements and Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the other significant environmental matters. These and other stringent environmental requirements have led PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU to retire approximately 800 megawatts of coal-fired generating plants in Kentucky. In September 2015, KU retired two coal-fired units, with a combined summer capacity rating of 161 MW, at the Green River plant. LG&E retired a 240 MW coal-fired unit in March 2015 and two additional coal-fired units, with a combined summer capacity rating of 323 MW, in June 2015 at the Cane Run plant. KU retired a 71 MW coal-fired unit at the Tyrone plant in 2013. The retirement of these units is not expected to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU.\nIn 2013, financing activities also included net cash contributions of $1.2 billion from PPL to PPL Energy Supply (discontinued operations) to fund debt maturities, to repay short-term debt and to terminate the operating lease arrangement for interests in the Montana Colstrip facility and acquire the previously leased interests.\nUsing these methodologies and weightings, PPL determined the estimated fair value of the Supply segment (classified as Level 3) was below its carrying value of $4.1 billion and recorded a loss on the spinoff of $879 million in the second quarter of 2015, which is reflected in discontinued operations and is nondeductible for tax purposes. This amount served to reduce the basis of the net assets accounted for as a dividend at the June 1, 2015 spinoff date.\nEarnings\n\nLG&E had a $5 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared with 2013.\nIn June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply executed definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to spin off PPL Energy Supply and immediately combine it with Riverstone's competitive power generation businesses to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy. On June 1, 2015, the spinoff was completed. See \"Financial and Operational Developments - Other Financial and Operational Developments - Spinoff of PPL Energy Supply\" below for additional information.\nSee \"Long-term Debt and Equity Securities\" below for additional information on current year activity. See \"Forecasted Sources of Cash\" for a discussion of the Registrants' plans to issue debt and equity securities, as well as a discussion of credit facility capacity available to the Registrants. Also see \"Forecasted Uses of Cash\" for a discussion of PPL's plans to pay dividends on common securities in the future, as well as the Registrants' maturities of long-term debt.\n (a) Represents amounts excluded from Margins. \nIncome Taxes\n(LG&E)\nLKE: Earnings, Margins and Statement of Income Analysis\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n (a) Represents unrealized gains (losses) on contracts that economically hedge anticipated GBP-denominated earnings. \n(LKE, LG&E and KU)\nAlthough the market value of Talen Energy approach utilized the most observable inputs of the three approaches, PPL considered certain limitations of the \"when-issued\" trading market for the spinoff transaction including the short trading duration, lack of liquidity in the market and anticipated initial Talen stock ownership base selling pressure, among other factors, and concluded that these factors limit the appropriateness of this input being solely determinative of the fair value of the Supply segment. As such, PPL also considered the other valuation approaches in estimating the overall fair value, but ultimately assigned the highest weighting to the Talen Energy market value approach.\nFor PPL, lower project expenditures at WPD and KU were partially offset by higher project expenditures at PPL Electric and LG&E. The decrease in expenditures for WPD was primarily due to a decrease in expenditures to enhance system reliability associated with the end of the DPCR5 price control period and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in expenditures for KU was related to lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7 which was put into commercial operation in June 2015, and lower expenditures for environmental air projects and CCR projects at KU's Ghent and E.W. Brown plants. The increase in expenditures for PPL Electric was primarily due to the Northeast Pocono reliability project, smart grid projects and other various projects, partially offset by the completion of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission project. The increase in expenditures for LG&E was primarily due to environmental air projects at LG&E's Mill Creek plant, partially offset by lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7.\n (a) In June 2014, PPL Electric's largest IBEW local ratified a new three-year labor agreement. In connection with the new agreement, bargaining unit one-time voluntary retirement benefits were recorded. \nPPL recorded a tax benefit of $7 million during 2013 to federal and state income tax reserves related to stranded cost securitization. The reserve balance at December 31, 2013 related to stranded costs securitization was zero.\n \u00b7 \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies\" provides an overview of the accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of the Registrants and that require their management to make significant estimates, assumptions and other judgments of inherently uncertain matters. \n(PPL)\n(All Registrants)\nEarnings generated by PPL's U.K. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk. The U.K. subsidiaries also have currency exposure to the U.S. dollar to the extent of their U.S. dollar denominated debt. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and cross currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency exchange contracts.\nEarnings\nInterest Expense\nIn December 2013, WPD and other U.K. DNOs announced agreements with the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change and Ofgem to a reduction of \u00a35 per residential customer of electricity distribution revenues that otherwise would have been collected in the regulatory year beginning April 1, 2014. Full recovery of the revenue reduction, together with the associated carrying cost will occur in the regulatory year beginning April 1, 2016. Under GAAP, WPD does not record a receivable for under recovery of regulated income (which this reduction represents), as a result earnings for the U.K. Regulated segment were adversely affected by $15 million in 2015 and $31 million in 2014. PPL projects earnings in 2016 will be positively affected by $32 million and earnings for 2017 will be positively affected by $17 million.\n\n \u00b7 Lower other operation and maintenance in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to $38 million from lower pension expense. \n (a) Includes net increase (decrease) in notes payable with affiliates. \n The increase in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to debt issuances at WPD (West Midlands) in October 2013, LG&E and KU in November 2013 and PPL Electric in June 2014 and July 2013. \n(PPL's Pennsylvania Regulated Segment and PPL Electric)\nLong-term debt and equity securities activity for 2015 included:\n (c) 2015, 2014 and 2013 exclude $46 million, $48 million and $44 million of ancillary activity revenues. 2014 and 2013 also exclude $65 million and $45 million of revenue reductions related to adjustments to WPD's line loss accrual related to DPCR4 which are considered special items. \n2016 Outlook\n \u00b7 See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Margins - Changes in Margins\" for an explanation of U.K. Gross Margins. \n\nThe following Statement of Income line items and their related increase (decrease) are included above within \"Margins\" and are not discussed separately.\nPPL plans to issue not more than $200 million of common stock in 2016.\nInterest expense increased by $8 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the issuance of $300 million of incremental First Mortgage Bonds in September 2015 and higher interest rates on $250 million of First Mortgage Bonds refinanced by LG&E.\nInterest expense increased by $22 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the issuance of $500 million of First Mortgage Bonds in November 2013 and higher short-term debt balances in 2014.\nInterest expense increased by $7 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the issuance of $250 million of First Mortgage Bonds in November 2013.\n \u00b7 \"Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins\" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity transmission and distribution delivery operations of the Pennsylvania Regulated segment and PPL Electric. In calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a PLR, are offset with minimal impact on earnings. Costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in \"Energy purchases,\" \"Other operation and maintenance,\" (which are primarily Act 129 and Universal Service program costs), and \"Taxes, other than income,\" which is primarily gross receipts tax. This performance measure includes PLR energy purchases by PPL Electric from PPL EnergyPlus, which are reflected in \"Energy purchases from affiliate\" in the reconciliation tables. As a result of the June 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply and the formation of Talen Energy, PPL EnergyPlus (renamed Talen Energy Marketing) is no longer an affiliate of PPL Electric. PPL Electric's purchases from Talen Energy Marketing subsequent to May 31, 2015 are reflected in \"Energy Purchases\" in the reconciliation tables. This measure represents the net revenues from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's and PPL Electric's electricity delivery operations. \n\nPPL received $136 million during 2015 from the sale of short-term investments.\nThe table below quantifies the changes in the components of Net Income between these periods, which reflect amounts classified as Margins and certain items that management considers special on separate lines within the table and not in their respective Statement of Income line items. See PPL's \"Results of Operations - Segment Earnings - Kentucky Regulated segment\" for details of these special items.\n \u00b7 Higher depreciation for both periods primarily due to transmission and distribution additions to PP&E, net, related to the ongoing efforts to improve reliability and replace aging infrastructure. \nOther Operation and Maintenance\n \u00b7 Pension funding was $10 million higher in 2015. \n\n\nThe following tables contain the components from the Statements of Income that are included in this non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to \"Operating Income.\"\nSee Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information related to the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, including the components of Discontinued Operations.\n (a) The increase in 2015 compared with 2014 is attributed to the change in mortality tables and lower discount rates. \n \u00b7 The decrease in cash from LKE's other operating activities was driven primarily by $88 million in payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps. \nOther income (expense) - net increased $3 million in 2015 compared with 2014 and increased $160 million in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to changes in realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency contracts to economically hedge GBP denominated earnings from WPD.\nInvesting Activities\nTransmission margins increased for both periods, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments focused on replacing the aging infrastructure and improving reliability.\n (b) As reported on the Statements of Income. \n\nCertain Operating Revenues and Expenses Included in \"Margins\"\n In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the December 2011 ruling, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, concerning the creditability of U.K. Windfall Profits Tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result of this decision, PPL recorded a tax benefit of $44 million during 2013. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nIn comparing 2014 with 2013, cash used by investing activities decreased as a result of the decrease in expenditures primarily due to lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7 and CCR projects at the Ghent and the E.W. Brown plants, partially offset by higher expenditures for environmental air projects at the Ghent and the E.W. Brown plants.\nATM Program (PPL)\nIntercompany (LKE, LG&E and KU)\n \u00b7 LKE's non-cash components of net income included a $213 million decrease in deferred income taxes, partially offset by a $28 million increase in depreciation due to additional assets in service in 2015. Deferred income taxes were lower in 2015 as a large portion of the effect of accelerated tax depreciation did not result in cash as a result of the Federal net operating losses. \nDepreciation\n \u00b7 Net income improved by $54 million between the periods. However, this included an additional $53 million of net non-cash benefits, primarily due to a decrease in deferred income tax expense. \nThe increase (decrease) in interest expense was due to:\n(LG&E)\n(All Registrants)\nThe following tables contain after-tax gains (losses), in total, which management considers special items, that are excluded from Earnings from Ongoing Operations and a reconciliation to PPL's \"Net Income (Loss)\" for the years ended December 31.\n (a) LG&E and KU participate in an intercompany agreement whereby LKE, LG&E and/or KU make available funds up to $500 million at an interest rate based on a market index of commercial paper issues. However, the FERC has authorized a maximum aggregate short-term debt limit for each utility at $500 million from all covered sources. \n\nThe changes in the components of the Kentucky Regulated segment's results between these periods were due to the factors set forth below, which reflect amounts classified as Kentucky Gross Margins and the items that management considers special on separate lines and not in their respective Statement of Income line item.\n (a) Recorded at LKE and represents a valuation allowance against tax credits expiring in 2016 through 2020 that are more likely than not to expire before being utilized. \n \u00b7 Higher other operation and maintenance for 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to $30 million of higher corporate service costs allocated to PPL Electric, $11 million of higher vegetation management expenses and related costs for additional work done by outside vendors and $5 million of higher bad debt expenses. \n\nLKE had a $64 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared with 2014.\nA key assumption included in the fair value estimate is the application of a control premium of 25% in the two market approaches. PPL concluded it was appropriate to apply a control premium in these approaches as the goodwill impairment testing guidance was followed in determining the estimated fair value of the Supply segment, which had historically been a reporting unit for PPL. This guidance provides that the market price of an individual security (and thus the market capitalization of a reporting unit with publically traded equity securities) may not be representative of the fair value of the reporting unit. This guidance also indicates that substantial value may arise to a controlling shareholder from the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that arise from control over another entity, and that the market price of a Company's individual share of stock does not reflect this additional value to a controlling shareholder. Therefore, the quoted market price need not be the sole measurement basis for determining the fair value, and including a control premium is appropriate in measuring the fair value of a reporting unit.\n \u00b7 Higher other operation and maintenance in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to $14 million of higher pension expense and $11 million of higher costs related to the Cane Run units' retirements consisting of an inventory write-down and separation benefits, partially offset by $7 million of lower storm costs and lower bad debt expense of $6 million. \n \u00b7 The $341 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to a decrease in taxes payable (primarily due to a decrease in current income tax expense in 2015), a decrease in accounts payable (primarily due \nThe components of the change in cash provided by (used in) financing activities were as follows.\nDiscontinued Operations\n\n \u00b7 Higher depreciation in 2014 compared with 2013 due to additions to PP&E, net. \nDepreciation increased by $29 million in 2015 compared with 2014, and by $7 million in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to additions to PP&E, net, related to the ongoing efforts to improve reliability and replace aging infrastructure.\n (a) Management considers this a special item. See PPL's \"Results of Operations - Segment Earnings - Kentucky Regulated Segment\" for details of this item. \n\n\n(PPL)\n (b) The U.K. Finance Acts of 2015 and 2013 reduced the U.K.'s statutory income tax rates. As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liability and recognized a deferred tax benefit in 2015 and 2013. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u00b7 The decrease in cash from working capital was driven primarily by an increase in income tax receivable from LKE as a result of the use of excess tax depreciation deductions, and an increase in accounts receivable from affiliates, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to extended payment terms, higher rates and colder December weather in 2013. \n\nInterest expense increased by $8 million in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to debt issuances in October 2015 and June 2014. Interest expense increased by $14 million in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to debt issuances in June 2014 and July 2013.\n (b) The increase in 2015 compared with 2014 was due to higher corporate support costs charged to Electric Utilities, primarily as a result of the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply. \nThe following should be read in conjunction with the Registrants' Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes.

The changes in sales volumes were driven by unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014.\n During 2013, PPL recorded $28 million of income tax expense resulting from increased taxable dividends offset by a $19 million income tax benefit associated with a ruling obtained from the IRS impacting the recalculation of 2010 U.K. earnings and profits that was reflected on an amended 2010 U.S. tax return. \nIn comparing 2014 with 2013, cash provided by financing activities increased due to an increase in short-term debt to fund capital expenditures and an increase in contributions from LKE, offset by the $250 million of long-term debt issued in November 2013.\n\nStatement of Income Analysis --\nPPL's businesses of WPD, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU plan to achieve this growth by providing efficient, reliable and safe operations and strong customer service, maintaining constructive regulatory relationships and achieving timely recovery of costs. These businesses are expected to achieve strong, long-term growth in rate base and RAV, as applicable, driven by planned significant capital expenditures to maintain existing assets and improve system reliability and, for LKE, LG&E and KU, to comply with federal and state environmental regulations related to coal-fired electricity generation facilities. Additionally, significant transmission rate base growth is expected through 2020 at PPL Electric.\nLG&E had a $183 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared with 2014.\n\nRate Case Proceedings (LKE, LG&E and KU)\n (c) The decrease in 2014 compared with 2013 was due to lower headcount, less maintenance work and more focus on capital projects in 2014. \nExcluding special items, higher earnings are expected in 2016 compared with 2015. This increase is primarily attributable to increases in the Kentucky Regulated and Pennsylvania Regulated segments. The following projections and factors underlying these projections (on an after-tax basis) are provided for PPL's segments and the Corporate and Other category and the related Registrants.\nFinancial Condition\nCertain Operating Revenues and Expenses Included in \"Margins\"\nThe increase (decrease) in income taxes was due to:\nTaxes, Other Than Income\n\nFollowing the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, PPL has no continuing ownership interest in or control of Talen Energy and Talen Energy Supply (formerly, PPL Energy Supply).\nKentucky Regulated Segment\n (d) During 2015, PPL recorded lower income taxes primarily due to a decrease in taxable dividends. \n (b) Issuances include a $400 million note with PPL Capital Funding.

The application is based on a fully projected future test year of January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. On September 3, 2015, PPL Electric filed with the PUC Administrative Law Judge a petition for approval of a settlement agreement resolving all issues in the case. On November 19, 2015, the PUC issued its final order approving the settlement agreement. Under that agreement, PPL Electric was permitted to increase its annual distribution rates by $124 million, effective January 1, 2016.\nThe Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of LKE's regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of LG&E and KU, as well as LG&E's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas. In addition, certain financing costs are allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment. The Kentucky Regulated segment represents 20% of PPL's Income from Continuing Operations After Income Taxes for 2015 and 35% of PPL's assets at December 31, 2015.\n(KU)\n \u00b7 The decrease in cash from LG&E's other operating activities was driven primarily by $44 million in payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps. \nThe Registrants maintain credit facilities to enhance liquidity, provide credit support and provide a backstop to commercial paper programs. Amounts borrowed under these credit facilities are reflected in \"Short-term debt\" on the Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2015, the total committed borrowing capacity under credit facilities and the use of this borrowing capacity were:\n \u00b7 \"Financial Condition - Risk Management\" provides an explanation of the Registrants' risk management programs relating to market and credit risk. \n\nAt December 31, 2015, LG&E's and KU's tax-exempt revenue bonds in the form of auction rate securities total $231 million ($135 million at LG&E and $96 million at KU). These bonds continue to experience failed auctions and the interest rate continues to be set by a formula pursuant to the relevant indentures. For the period ended December 31, 2015, the weighted-average rate on LG&E's and KU's auction rate bonds in total was 0.22% (0.20% at LG&E and 0.24% at KU).\nThe following Statement of Income line items and their related increase (decrease) are included above within \"Margins\" and are not discussed separately.\n \u00b7 Lower other operation and maintenance for 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to $16 million of lower payroll related expenses due to lower headcount, less maintenance projects and more focus on capital work in 2014. \n\nTaxes, other than income decreased by $13 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the settlement of a 2011 gross receipts tax audit resulting in the reversal of $17 million of previously recognized reserves.\n \u00b7 The $166 million decrease in cash from other operating activities was partially due to net proceeds of $104 million for settlement in 2013 of forward starting interest rate swaps. \nAs discussed above, a key component of this strategy is to maintain constructive relationships with our regulators in all jurisdictions in which we operate (U.K., U.S. federal and state). This is supported by our strong culture of integrity and delivering on commitments to our customers, regulators and shareowners, and a commitment to continue to improve our customer service, reliability and efficiency of operations.\nEarnings (PPL)\nEarnings in 2015 compared with 2014 increased primarily due to higher base rates and returns on additional environmental capital investments partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and lower sales volume. The increases in base rates were the result of new rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2015. The change in sales volume were due to milder weather during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nThe increase (decrease) in other operation and maintenance was due to:\nSegment Earnings\n (b) The increase in 2015 compared with 2014 is attributed to the change in mortality tables and lower discount rates. \n(PPL)\nKentucky Gross Margins increased in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to returns on additional environmental capital investments of $55 million ($27 million at LG&E and $28 million at KU) and higher volumes of $13 million ($5 million at LG&E and $8 million at KU). The change in volumes was driven by unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014.\n (a) The decrease in 2015 compared with 2014 was primarily due to the settlement of the 2011 gross receipts tax audit resulting in the reversal of $17 million of previously recognized reserves. \n\n\nSpinoff of PPL Energy Supply\n \u00b7 \"Overview\" provides a description of each Registrant's business strategy, a description of key factors expected to impact future earnings and a discussion of important financial and operational developments. \n\u2022 Acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments.\nOn June 30, 2015, the KPSC approved a rate case settlement agreement providing for increases in the annual revenue requirements associated with KU base electricity rates of $125 million and LG&E base gas rates of $7 million. The annual revenue requirement associated with base electricity rates at LG&E was not changed. Although the settlement did not establish a specific return on equity with respect to the base rates, an authorized 10% return on equity will be utilized in the ECR and GLT mechanisms. The settlement agreement provides for deferred recovery of costs associated with KU's retirement of Green River Units 3 and 4. The new regulatory asset will be amortized over three years. The settlement also provides regulatory asset treatment for the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with LG&E and KU's pension accounting policy and pension expense using a 15 year amortization period for actuarial gains and losses. The new rates and all elements of the settlement became effective July 1, 2015.\nLong-term Debt and Equity Securities\n\nPPL Segment Earnings, Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Statement of Income Analysis\nIncome taxes increased by $11 million in 2015 compared with 2014 and increased by $9 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the change in pre-tax income at current period tax rates.\n(PPL)\n(All Registrants)\nThe Registrants expect to continue to have adequate liquidity available from operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities and commercial paper issuances. Additionally, subject to market conditions, the Registrants and their subsidiaries may access the capital markets, and PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU anticipate receiving equity contributions from their parent or member in 2016.\n \u00b7 Net income improved by $69 million between the periods. This included an additional $124 million of net non-cash charges, including a $279 million increase in deferred income tax expense. These non-cash charges were partially offset by $243 million of higher unrealized gains on hedging activities. \n \u00b7 \"Results of Operations\" for PPL provides a detailed analysis of earnings by segment, and for PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU, includes a summary of earnings. For all Registrants, \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\", \"Earnings from Ongoing Operations\" and \"Margins\" provide explanations of non-GAAP measures used and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. \"Statement of Income Analysis\" addresses significant changes in principal line items on the Statements of Income, comparing 2015 with 2014 and 2014 with 2013. \n\nIncome Taxes\nPPL Electric is currently authorized to incur, subject to market conditions, up to approximately $500 million of long-term indebtedness in 2016, the proceeds of which would be used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes.\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n(LKE)\nCertain Operating Revenues and Expenses Included in \"Margins\"\nEarnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items.

Commercial paper issuances, included in \"Short-term debt\" on the Balance Sheets, are supported by the respective Registrant's Syndicated Credit Facility. The following commercial paper programs were in place at:\nThe following Statement of Income line items are included above within \"Margins\" and are not discussed separately.\nIn September 2013, KU filed an application with the FERC to adjust the formula rate under which KU provided wholesale requirements power sales to 12 municipal customers. Among other changes, the application requests an amended formula whereby KU would charge cost-based rates with a subsequent true-up to actual costs, replacing the current formula which does not include a true-up. KU's application proposed an authorized return on equity of 10.7%. Certain elements, including the new formula rate, became effective April 23, 2014, subject to refund. In April 2014, nine municipalities submitted notices of termination, under the original notice period provisions, to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements contracts. Such terminations are to be effective in 2019, except in the case of one municipality with a 2017 effective date. In addition, a tenth municipality has become a transmission-only customer as of June 2015. In July 2014, KU agreed on settlement terms with the two municipal customers that did not provide termination notices and filed the settlement proposal with the FERC for its approval. In August 2014, the FERC issued an order on the interim settlement agreement allowing the proposed rates to become effective pending a final order. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the FERC approved the settlement agreement resolving the rate case with respect to these two municipalities, including approval of the formula rate with a true-up provision and authorizing a return on equity of 10% or the return on equity awarded to other parties in this case, whichever is lower. In August 2015, KU filed a partial settlement agreement with the nine terminating municipalities, resolving all but one open matter with one municipality. The settlement was approved by FERC in the fourth quarter of 2015, including authorizing the agreed-upon refunds, approving the formula rate with a true-up provision, and authorizing a 10.25% return on equity. Refunds to both the remaining municipals and the departing municipals were issued during the fourth quarter of 2015 totaling $3.4 million. A single remaining unresolved issue with one terminating municipality is in FERC litigation proceedings. Hearings on the dispute were conducted in January 2016 and preliminary rulings on the matter may occur in mid- or late-2016. KU cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this remaining FERC proceeding, but the amounts under continuing dispute are not estimated to be significant.\nIn 2014, financing activities also included net cash distributions of $1.2 billion to PPL from PPL Energy Supply (discontinued operations) for the proceeds from the PPL Montana hydroelectric generation facilities sale, net of a tax liability payment and proceeds from a tax grant.\nU.K. Gross Margins excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to $194 million from the April 1, 2014 and 2013 price increases, partially offset by $88 million from lower volumes due primarily to weather.\n(PPL Electric)\nThe following table summarizes PPL's fair value analysis:\nThe assets and liabilities of PPL's Supply segment for all periods prior to the spinoff are included in \"Current assets of discontinued operations\", \"Noncurrent assets of discontinued operations\", \"Current liabilities of discontinued operations\" and \"Noncurrent liabilities of discontinued operations\" on PPL's Balance Sheet.\n (b) Costs were lower in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to the benefits of corporate restructuring. Costs were higher in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to higher long-term debt interest expense. \n (a) Issuances are net of pricing discounts, where applicable and exclude the impact of debt issuance costs. \nThe table below quantifies the changes in the components of Net Income between these periods, which reflect amounts classified as Margins within the table and not in their respective Statement of Income line items.\nEffective January 1, 2015, after completing a review of the useful lives of its distribution network assets, WPD extended the weighted average useful lives of these assets to 69 years from 55 years for GAAP reporting of depreciation expense. For 2015, this change in useful lives resulted in lower depreciation expense of $84 million ($66 million after-tax or $0.10 per share).\nIn 2014, PPL Electric required $75 million less cash from financing activities to support its significant capital expenditure program, primarily due to the receipt of $150 million on notes receivable from affiliates (as described in \"Investing Activities\" above) and improvements in cash from operations of $90 million.\n\n (a) Represents amounts excluded from Margins. \n\nSee \"Forecasted Uses of Cash\" for detail regarding projected capital expenditures for the years 2016 through 2020.\n (a) At December 31, 2015, $447 million of cash and cash equivalents were denominated in GBP. If these amounts would be remitted as dividends, PPL would not anticipate a material incremental U.S. tax cost. Historically, dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries have been limited to distributions of the current year's earnings. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information on undistributed earnings of WPD. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures including \"Earnings from Ongoing Operations\" and \"Gross Margins\" as further described below.\nThe increase (decrease) in taxes, other than income was due to:\n\u2022 Unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency-related economic hedges.\n\nPPL paid $120 million during 2014 from the purchase of short-term investments.\nLong-term Debt and Equity Securities\n\nIn comparing 2015 with 2014, cash used by investing activities increased as a result of receiving payment from PPL in 2014 for the notes receivable issued in 2013, partially offset by lower PP&E\nInterest Expense\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\nU.K.\nTransmission\n (e) The U.K.'s Finance Act 2015, enacted in November 2015, reduces the U.K. statutory income tax rate from 20% to 19% effective April 1, 2017 and from 19% to 18% effective April 1, 2020. As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a $90 million deferred tax benefit in 2015 related to both rate decreases. \nIn comparing 2014 with 2013, cash used by investing activities increased as a result of the increase in expenditures primarily due to environmental air projects at the Mill Creek plant and the gas service riser program, partially offset by lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7.\n \u00b7 \"U.K. Gross Margins\" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity distribution operations of the U.K. Regulated segment. In calculating this measure, direct costs such as National Grid connection charges and Ofgem license fees (recorded in \"Other operations and maintenance expense\" on the Statement of Income) are deducted from operating revenues as they are costs passed through to customers. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from the delivery of electricity across WPD's distribution network in the U.K. and directly related activities. \n (a) The increase in 2015 compared with 2014 is primarily due to 2015 including interest expense related to certain PPL Energy Funding debt that was previously associated with PPL's Supply segment and included in \"Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes) in 2014. \nIncome Taxes\n \u00b7 Lower taxes, other than income for 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the settlement of a 2011 gross receipts tax audit resulting in the reversal of $17 million of previously recognized reserves. \n\n\"Margins\" is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that management utilizes as an indicator of the performance of its business. See PPL's \"Results of Operations - Margins\" for an explanation of why management believes this measure is useful and the underlying drivers of the changes between periods. Within PPL's discussion, LG&E's Margins are included in \"Kentucky Gross Margins.\"\n \u00b7 \"Kentucky Gross Margins\" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of the Kentucky Regulated segment, LKE, LG&E and KU, as well as the Kentucky Regulated segment's, LKE's and LG&E's distribution and sale of natural gas. In calculating this measure, fuel, energy purchases and certain variable costs of production (recorded as \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income) are deducted from revenues. In addition, certain other expenses, recorded as \"Other operation and maintenance\", \"Depreciation\" and \"Taxes, other than income\" on the Statements of Income, associated with approved cost recovery mechanisms are offset against the recovery of those expenses, which are included in revenues. These mechanisms allow for direct recovery of these expenses and, in some cases, returns on capital investments and performance incentives. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from electricity and gas operations. \nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31 and the changes between periods were as follows.\n (a) Represents amounts excluded from Margins. \nThe Statements of Cash Flows separately report the cash flows of the discontinued operations.

In February 2014, Ofgem published formal confirmation that WPD's Business Plans submitted by its four DNOs under RIIO-ED1 were accepted as submitted, or \"fast-tracked.\" Fast tracking afforded several benefits to the WPD DNOs including the ability to collect additional revenue equivalent to 2.5% of Totex during the eight-year price control period (approximately $43 million annually), greater revenue certainty and a higher level of cost savings retention.

See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \nKentucky Gross Margins\n\nOn March 31, 2015, PPL Electric filed a petition requesting a waiver of the DSIC cap of 5% of billed revenues and approval to increase the maximum allowable DSIC from 5% to 7.5% for service rendered after January 1, 2016. PPL Electric filed the petition concurrently with its 2015 rate case and the Administrative Law Judge granted PPL Electric's request to consolidate these two proceedings. Under the terms of the settlement agreement discussed above, PPL Electric agreed to withdraw the petition without prejudice to filing it at a later date.\nThis \"Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" is separately filed by PPL Corporation, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU. Information contained herein relating to any individual Registrant is filed by such Registrant solely on its own behalf, and no Registrant makes any representation as to information relating to any other Registrant. The specific Registrant to which disclosures are applicable is identified in parenthetical headings in italics above the applicable disclosure or within the applicable disclosure for each Registrant's related activities and disclosures. Within combined disclosures, amounts are disclosed for any Registrant when significant.\n \u00b7 Higher income taxes in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to a $19 million increase primarily in taxable dividends and a $19 million benefit in 2013 related to an IRS ruling regarding 2010 U.K. earnings and profits calculations. \n(All Registrants)\n (a) Represents amounts excluded from Margins. \nIn addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, the credit agreements governing the above credit facilities contain various other covenants. Failure to comply with the covenants after applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of repayment of borrowings and/or termination of the agreements. The Registrants monitor compliance with the covenants on a regular basis. At December 31, 2015, the Registrants were in compliance with these covenants. At this time, the Registrants believe that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to these funding sources.\n (b) As reported on the Statements of Income. \n \u00b7 The decrease in cash from LKE's other operating activities was driven primarily by $86 million in proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps received in 2013. \nPPL and its subsidiaries are currently authorized to incur, subject to market conditions, up to approximately $2 billion of long-term indebtedness in 2016, the proceeds of which would be used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes.\n\nThe following tables contain the components from the Statement of Income that are included in the non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to PPL's \"Operating Income\" for the years ended December 31.\nDepreciation increased by $23 million in 2015 compared with 2014 and by $11 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to additions to PP&E, net.\nForecasted Sources of Cash\nRegulatory Requirements\nU.K. Depreciation\n \u00b7 LG&E's non-cash components of net income included an $8 million increase in deferred income taxes and a $5 million increase in depreciation due to additional assets in service in 2015. \nThe following tables contain the components from the Statements of Income that are included in this non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to \"Operating Income.\"\n(PPL Electric)\nDepreciation\nThe changes in the components of the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's results between these periods were due to the factors set forth below, which reflect amounts classified as Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins and the item that management considers special on separate lines and not in their respective Statement of Income line item.\n\n (a) Effective January 1, 2015, after completion of a review of the useful lives of its distribution network assets, WPD extended the weighted average useful lives of these assets to 69 years from 55 years resulting in lower depreciation of $84 million ($66 million after-tax or $0.10 per share). \nU.K. Gross Margins\n (b) The increase in 2015 compared with 2014 is attributed to the change in mortality tables and lower discount rates. \nThe Pennsylvania Regulated segment includes the regulated electricity transmission and distribution operations of PPL Electric. The Pennsylvania Regulated segment represents 16% of PPL's Income from Continuing Operations After Income Taxes for 2015 and 22% of PPL's assets at December 31, 2015.\n\n (a) Represents amounts excluded from Margins. \n(All Registrants)\nEarnings in 2015 compared with 2014 increased primarily due to returns on additional environmental capital investments partially offset by higher income taxes, financing costs and lower sales volume. The change in sales volume was due to milder weather during the fourth quarter of 2015.\n \u00b7 Higher other operation and maintenance in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to $14 million of higher expenses due to the timing and scope of scheduled generation maintenance outages, $9 million of higher bad debt expense and higher storm expenses of $8 million. \nCommercial Paper (All Registrants)\n (f) The decrease in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to lower amortization of prior period losses and an increase in expected asset returns. \n\nPPL had a $494 million increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2014 compared with 2013.\nIncome taxes increased by $5 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the change in pre-tax income at current period tax rates.\n\nPPL had a $669 million decrease in cash from operating activities from continuing operations in 2015 compared with 2014.\n \u00b7 Higher income taxes in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to higher pre-tax income. \nSee \"Results of Operations\" below for further discussion of PPL's results of operations, details of special items by reportable segments and analysis of the consolidated results of operations.\nIn 2015, PPL Electric required $28 million less cash from financing activities due to the use of cash on hand which helped support the significant capital expenditure program.\nIn June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply executed definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to spin off PPL Energy Supply and immediately combine it with Riverstone's competitive power generation businesses to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy. In June 2015, the spinoff was completed. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information relating to the transaction.\nU.K. Gross Margins excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to $171 million from the April 1, 2015 price decrease resulting from the commencement of RIIO-ED1, partially offset by $46 million from the April 1, 2014 price increase.\nFERC Wholesale Formula Rates (LKE and KU)\n", "item_7_text": "For the U.S. businesses, our strategy is to recover capital project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test years, annual FERC formula rate mechanisms and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory lag. In Kentucky, the KPSC has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ECR, DSM, GLT, fuel adjustment clause, gas supply clause and recovery on construction work-in-progress) that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In addition, the KPSC requires a utility to obtain a CPCN prior to constructing a facility, unless the construction is an ordinary extension of existing facilities in the usual course of business or does not involve sufficient capital outlay to materially affect the utility's financial condition. Although such KPSC proceedings do not directly address cost recovery issues, the KPSC, in awarding a CPCN, concludes that the public convenience and necessity require the construction of the facility on the basis that the facility is the lowest reasonable cost alternative for addressing the need. In Pennsylvania, the FERC transmission formula rate, DSIC mechanism, Smart Meter Rider and other recovery mechanisms are in place to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on prudently incurred costs.\n\n (a) Primarily represents financing and certain other costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, which are presented to reconcile segment information to PPL's consolidated results. 2015 and 2014 include costs related to the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information. (b) As a result of the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, substantially representing PPL's Supply segment, the earnings of the Supply segment are included in Discontinued Operations. 2015 includes an $879 million charge reflecting the difference between PPL's recorded value for the Supply segment and its estimated fair value as of the spinoff date, determined in accordance with the applicable accounting rules under GAAP. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information. 2013 excludes $2 million which has been classified as discontinued operations in the Kentucky Regulated segment. \nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes) for all periods presented, primarily includes the results of operations of PPL Energy Supply, which was spun off from PPL on June 1, 2015 and substantially represents PPL's former Supply segment. See \"Discontinued Operations\" in Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\n \u00b7 See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Margins - Changes in Margins\" for an explanation of Kentucky Gross Margins. \nNet Income and Earnings from Ongoing Operations include the following results.\nExcluding special items, relatively flat earnings are projected in 2016 compared with 2015, due to higher financing costs, depreciation expense, currency, taxes and other expenses, partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expense, including pension expense, and higher gross margins. The 2016 foreign currency exposure for this segment is 95% hedged at an average rate of $1.56 per pound.\n\n (a) Represents an inventory write-down and separation benefits. \nIn 2015, PPL required $220 million additional cash from financing activities including the WPD, LG&E and KU long-term debt issuances in 2015, partially offset by lower common stock issuances in 2015.\n\nThe components of the change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities were as follows.\n(PPL)\n(KU)\nThe table below quantifies the changes in the components of Net Income between these periods, which reflect amounts classified as Margins and certain items that management considers special on separate lines within the table and not in their respective Statement of Income line items. See PPL's \"Results of Operations - Segment Earnings - Kentucky Regulated segment\" for details of the special items.\n (g) The offsetting impacts from foreign currency hedging instruments are recorded in \"Other Income (Expense)-net.\" \n(LG&E)\n\n(PPL Electric)\nForecasted Uses of Cash\nIn comparing 2015 with 2014, cash provided by financing activities decreased as a result of the repayment of short-term debt, partially offset by the $550 million of additional long-term debt issued by LG&E and KU in 2015 and lower distributions to PPL.\nNet assets, after recognition of the loss on spinoff, of $3.2 billion were distributed to PPL shareowners in the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply.\n\nExcluding special items, earnings increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to higher base rates and returns on additional environmental capital investments partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expense, income taxes, financing costs and lower sales volume. The increases in base rates were the result of new rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2015. The change in sales volume was due to milder weather during the fourth quarter of 2015.\n(All Registrants)\nExcluding special items, higher earnings are projected in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily driven by a distribution base rate increase effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins, partially offset by higher depreciation expense, higher financing costs and a benefit received in 2015 from the release of a gross receipts tax reserve.\n \u00b7 The increase in cash from changes in working capital was driven primarily by a decrease in income tax receivable as a result of receiving payment from PPL in 2015 for the use of excess tax depreciation deductions in 2014, decreases in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to milder weather in December 2015, a decrease in coal inventory as a result of plant retirements, and a decrease in natural gas stored underground due to lower gas prices in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of fuel purchases and payments. \n\nFrom time to time, LKE's member or the parents of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU make capital contributions to subsidiaries. The proceeds from these contributions are used to fund capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes and, in the case of LKE, to make contributions to its subsidiaries.\nOn June 30, 2015, KU filed an application with the VSCC to increase annual Virginia base electricity revenue by approximately $7 million, representing an increase of 10.1%. On December 3, 2015, KU and other parties filed a proposed settlement with the VSCC. On February 2, 2016, the VSCC issued an order approving the settlement. The settlement provides for annual electric base revenues of $6 million and establishes an authorized return on equity range of 9.5% to 10.5% for annual rate review purposes. The new rates became effective February 15, 2016.\nSee Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes.\n During 2014, PPL recorded $47 million of income tax expense primarily attributable to taxable dividends. \nPPL Electric had a $90 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared with 2013.\nIn 2014, PPL required $2.5 billion less cash from financing activities including the PPL Capital Funding and WPD long-term debt issuances in 2014, lower common stock issuances in 2014 and improvements in cash from operations of $494 million which helped support the significant capital expenditure programs of its subsidiaries.\nThese measures are not intended to replace \"Operating Income,\" which is determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of overall operating performance. Other companies may use different measures to analyze and report their results of operations. Management believes these measures provide additional useful criteria to make investment decisions. These performance measures are used, in conjunction with other information, by senior management and PPL's Board of Directors to manage the operations and analyze actual results compared with budget.\n\n (a) 2014 and 2013 were adjusted to include costs that were previously allocated to the Supply segment that would remain with PPL after the completion of the transaction, if left unmitigated. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Reconciliation of Earnings from Ongoing Operations\" below for an itemization of special items impacting Corporate and Other. \nOther Financial and Operational Developments\n\n \u00b7 Higher interest expense in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to an October 2013 debt issuance. \n \u00b7 The decrease in cash from working capital was driven primarily by an increase in income tax receivable and a decrease of income tax payable from PPL as a result of the use of excess tax depreciation deductions, and an increase in inventory due to increased coal purchases in anticipation of a cold December similar to that of 2013, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to extended payment terms, higher rates and colder December weather in 2013. \n\nOther Income (Expense) - net\n (d) Relates to the 2015 settlement of the IRS audit for the tax years 1998-2011. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \nDiscount Rate Change for U.K. Pension Plans\n (e) At December 31, 2015, the unused capacity under the U.K. committed credit facilities was approximately $1.4 billion. The commitments under the U.K.'s credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group with no one bank providing more than 14% of the total committed capacity. \nEarnings\nSee Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes.\nMargins\n\nKU had a $71 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared with 2013.\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the Registrants' credit facilities.\nThe following after-tax gains (losses), which management considers special items, impacted the Kentucky Regulated segment's results and are excluded from Earnings from Ongoing Operations.\nIn comparing 2015 with 2014, cash provided by financing activities decreased as a result of the repayment of short-term debt and lower capital contributions from LKE, partially offset by the $250 million of additional long-term debt issued in 2015.\nDepreciation increased by $28 million in 2015 compared with 2014 and by $20 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to additions to PP&E, net.\n \u00b7 \"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources\" provides an analysis of the Registrants' liquidity positions and credit profiles. This section also includes a discussion of forecasted sources and uses of cash and rating agency actions. \n\u2022 Gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business.\n\n\n\nExcluding special items, costs are projected to be relatively flat in 2016 compared with 2015.\n (b) In March 2014, a $9 million loss was recorded related to PPL Capital Funding's remarketing and debt exchange of the junior subordinated notes originally issued in April 2011 as a component of the 2011 Equity Units. In May 2013, a $10 million loss was recorded related to PPL Capital Funding's remarketing and exchange of the junior subordinated notes that were originally issued in June 2010 as a component of PPL's 2010 Equity Units. \nliabilities related to the separation benefits were $13 million and $20 million, which are included in \"Other current liabilities\" on the Balance Sheets.\n \u00b7 The $99 million decrease in cash provided by other operating activities was primarily due to payments of $101 million for the settlement in 2015 of forward starting interest rate swaps. \nOperating Activities\nThe following tables contain the components from the Statements of Income that are included in this non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to \"Operating Income.\"\nSee \"Item 1. Business,\" \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" and \"Financial and Operational Developments - Other Financial and Operational Developments - Cost of Spinoff\" and \"Loss on Spinoff\" below for additional information.\nManagement utilizes \"Earnings from Ongoing Operations\" as a non-GAAP financial measure and it should not be considered as an alternative to net income, which is an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's fundamental earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. PPL's management also uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring certain corporate performance goals. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance. Earnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items as described below, which for all years includes the Supply segment's earnings now reflected in discontinued operations. Also included in special items in 2015 is the loss on spinoff, reflecting the fair value of the Supply segment being less than PPL's recorded value as of the June 1, 2015 spinoff. Earnings from Ongoing Operations for 2014 and 2013 also reflects, within the Corporate and Other category, the impact of spinoff dissynergies that, if not mitigated, would remain with PPL after completion of the spinoff.\nTables analyzing changes in amounts between periods within \"Segment Earnings\" and \"Statement of Income Analysis\" are presented on a constant U.K. foreign currency exchange rate basis, where applicable, in order to isolate the impact of the change in the exchange rate on the item being explained. Results computed on a constant U.K. foreign currency exchange\n\nResults of Operations\n\"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" includes the following information:\nMargins\nFinancing Activities\n(PPL)\nU.K. Regulated Segment\nAs a result of the PPL Energy Supply spinoff announcement, PPL recorded $50 million of deferred income tax expense during 2014 to adjust the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets primarily for state net operating loss carryforwards that were previously supported by the future earnings of PPL Energy Supply. See Note 8 for additional information on the spinoff.\nLG&E: Earnings, Margins and Statement of Income Analysis\n\nAt the close of the transaction in 2015, $72 million ($42 million after-tax) of cash flow hedges, primarily unamortized losses on PPL interest rate swaps recorded in AOCI and designated as cash flow hedges of PPL Energy Supply's future interest payments, were reclassified into interest expense and reflected in discontinued operations.\nOverview\n\nNet Income and Earnings from Ongoing Operations include the following results.\nDistribution margins increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to returns on additional distribution improvement capital investments of $17 million partially offset by a $12 million benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2014 as a result of a change in estimate of a regulatory liability.\nU.K. Tax Rate Change\n\n\n(All Registrants)\nSee Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes.\nMargins\nInterest Expense\n(PPL)\n \u00b7 Higher income taxes in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to higher pre-tax income. \n\nTo manage financing costs and access to credit markets, and to fund capital expenditures, a key objective of the Registrants is to maintain their investment grade credit ratings and adequate liquidity positions. In addition, the Registrants have financial and operational risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility, as applicable, related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and counterparty credit quality. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options, and swaps.\nCosts of Spinoff\nIn comparing 2015 with 2014, cash provided by financing activities decreased as a result of the repayment of short-term debt and lower capital contributions from LKE, partially offset by the $300 million of additional long-term debt issued in 2015.\nThe discussion for PPL provides a review of results by reportable segment. The \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" discussion provides explanations of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The \"Statement of Income Analysis\" discussion addresses significant changes in principal line items on PPL's Statements of Income, comparing year-to-year changes. \"Segment Earnings, Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Statement of Income Analysis\" is presented separately for PPL.\n\"Margins\" is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that management utilizes as an indicator of the performance of its business. See PPL's \"Results of Operations - Margins\" for an explanation of why management believes this measure is useful and the underlying drivers of the changes between periods. Within PPL's discussion, LKE's Margins are referred to as \"Kentucky Gross Margins.\"\nRegional Transmission Expansion Plan\n \u00b7 KU's non-cash components of net income included a $64 million decrease in deferred income taxes, partially offset by a $23 million increase in depreciation due to additional assets in service in 2015. Deferred income taxes were lower in 2015 as a large portion of the effect of accelerated tax depreciation did not result in cash as a result of the Federal net operating losses. \n (e) In 2013, WPD Midlands increased its line loss liability for DCPR4 based on additional information provided by Ofgem regarding the calculation. In March 2014, Ofgem issued its final decision on the DPCR4 line loss incentives and penalties mechanism. As a result, WPD increased its existing liability for over-recovery of line losses. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u00b7 The increase in cash from changes in working capital was driven primarily by a decrease in income tax receivable as a result of receiving payment from LKE in 2015 for the use of excess tax depreciation deductions in 2014, a decrease in coal inventory as a result of the retirement of Green River coal units, and decreases in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to milder weather in December 2015, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable to affiliates compared to an increase in the prior year due to lower fuel costs for jointly owned units and a decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of fuel purchases and payments. \nIn addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as purchased power, payroll, fuel and taxes, the Registrants currently expect to incur future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations, payment of dividends on its common stock, distributions by LKE to their members, and possibly the purchase or redemption of a portion of debt securities.\nSee Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes.\n(KU)\nFor PPL Electric, in 2015 compared with 2014, the increase in expenditures was primarily due to the Northeast Pocono reliability project, smart grid projects and other various projects, partially offset by the completion of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission project.\nCredit Facilities\nIn selecting the discount rate for its U.K. pension plans, WPD historically used a single weighted-average discount rate in the calculation of net periodic defined benefit cost. WPD will begin using individual spot rates to measure service cost and interest cost beginning with the calculation of 2016 net periodic defined benefit cost. Based on current estimates, PPL expects this change to reduce net periodic defined benefit costs by $44 million ($36 million after-tax or $0.05 per share) in 2016. Assuming interest rates continue to rise, the benefit is highest in the initial year and then falls over time as the additional actuarial losses on liabilities are amortized. See \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies-Defined Benefits\" for additional information.\n (a) The increase in 2015 compared with 2014 is attributed to the change in mortality tables and lower discount rates. \nExternal\n \u00b7 Lower income taxes in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to $25 million from lower U.K. tax rates and $11 million from lower pre-tax income. \n\nStatement of Income Analysis --\nContributions from Parent/Member (PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)\nFinancial and Operational Developments\nEarnings in future periods are subject to various risks and uncertainties. See \"Forward-Looking Information,\" \"Item 1. Business,\" \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" the rest of this Item 7, and Notes 1, 6 and 13 to the Financial Statements (as applicable) for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and factors that may impact future earnings.\nFor PPL, in 2014 compared with 2013, the increase in \"Expenditures for PP&E\" was partially due to expenditures made in 2014 at WPD (primarily due to projects to enhance system reliability and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates) partially offset by expenditures made in 2013 for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7 for both LG&E and KU.\nLG&E and KU are currently authorized to incur, subject to market conditions, up to approximately $100 million each of long-term indebtedness in 2016, the proceeds of which would be used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. LG&E currently plans to remarket, subject to market conditions, a $25 million bond with a put date in 2016.\nThe following Statement of Income line items and their related increase (decrease) are included above within \"Margins\" and are not discussed separately.\nKentucky Gross Margins increased in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to higher base rates of $64 million ($61 million at KU and $3 million at LG&E) and returns on additional environmental capital investments of $53 million ($36 million at LG&E and $17 million at KU). The increases in base rates were the result of new rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2015. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in volumes of $28 million ($23 million at KU and $5 million at LG&E) primarily due to milder weather during the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\n\u2022 Supply segment discontinued operations.\n \u00b7 Higher income taxes in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to higher pre-tax income which increased income taxes by $46 million and tax benefits related to federal and state income tax reserves of $8 million in 2013. \nThe table below quantifies the changes in the components of Net Income between these periods, which reflect amounts classified as Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins and an item that management considers special on separate lines within the table and not in their respective Statement of Income line items.\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information about long-term debt and equity securities.\nThe following Statement of Income line items and their related increase (decrease) are included above within \"Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins\" and are not discussed separately.\nInterest expense increased by $15 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the issuance of $250 million of First Mortgage Bonds in November 2013 and amortization of a fair market value adjustment of $7 million in 2013.\n\nManagement also utilizes the following non-GAAP financial measures as indicators of performance for its businesses.\nSee Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes.\n\n(PPL's U.K. Regulated Segment)\n(PPL Electric)\n (b) Recorded at PPL and allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment. The amount represents a settlement between E.ON AG (a German corporation and the indirect parent of E.ON US Investments Corp., the former parent of LKE) and PPL for a tax matter. \n\nThe Registrants' cash flows from operations and access to cost effective bank and capital markets are subject to risks and uncertainties. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that could affect the Registrants' cash flows.\nDepreciation\n\u2022 Other charges or credits that are, in management's view, not reflective of the company's ongoing operations.\nexpenditures. An increase in expenditures for LG&E was primarily due to higher expenditures for environmental air projects at the Mill Creek plant, partially offset by lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7. A decrease in expenditures for KU was primarily due to lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7 which was put into commercial operation in June 2015, and lower expenditures for environmental air projects and CCR projects at the Ghent and the E.W. Brown plants.\nThe U.K. Regulated segment consists of PPL Global which primarily includes WPD's regulated electricity distribution operations, the results of hedging the translation of WPD's earnings from British pound sterling to U.S. dollars, and certain costs, such as U.S. income taxes, administrative costs, and allocated financing costs. The U.K. Regulated segment represents 70% of PPL's Income from Continuing Operations After Income Taxes for 2015 and 42% of PPL's assets at December 31, 2015.\n\n\nEarnings in 2014 compared with 2013 increased primarily due to returns on additional environmental capital investments and higher sales volume partially offset by higher operation and maintenance driven by storm-related expenses, financing costs, depreciation and income tax expense. The changes in sales volume were driven by unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014.\n (a) The decrease in 2014 compared with 2013 was due to lower headcount, less maintenance work and more focus on capital projects in 2014. \nEarnings in 2014 compared with 2013 decreased primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expense driven by the timing and scope of scheduled generation maintenance outages, higher bad debt expense, storm-related expenses, higher financing costs and higher depreciation expense partially offset by returns on additional environmental capital investments and higher sales volumes. The changes in sales volumes were driven by unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014.\nIn July 2014, PPL Electric announced Project Compass, a proposal to construct a new multi-state transmission line. On October 27, 2015, PPL Electric filed an interconnection application with the New York Independent System Operator for the first segment of the project which contains a proposed 95-mile, $500 million to $600 million line between Blakely, Pennsylvania, and Ramapo, New York. The proposed line is intended to provide significant economic benefits for electricity customers in New York and also to provide grid reliability and grid security benefits for electricity customers in both states. The construction is proposed to begin in 2019 and be in operation by 2023. There will be numerous approvals required, including, among others, the public utility commissions of Pennsylvania and New York, the New York Independent System Operator, PJM, and FERC. As originally proposed in 2014, Project Compass would have run from western Pennsylvania into New York and New Jersey and also south into Maryland, covering approximately 725 miles at an estimated cost of $4 billion to $6 billion. The project has been revised to include about 475 miles of transmission line in Pennsylvania and New York at an estimated cost of $3 billion to $4 billion. Beyond this segment, no schedule is proposed for the rest of the project. There can be no assurance that this segment of Project Compass will be approved as proposed. Additionally, PPL Electric is\n \u00b7 The $148 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital was partially due to a decrease in taxes payable (primarily due an increase in current income tax benefits in 2015) and a decrease in accounts payable (primarily due to milder weather and lower energy prices in December 2015), partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable (primarily due to milder weather in 2015, improved collection performance and higher write-offs). \nLKE had a $79 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared with 2013.\n (e) The increase in 2015 compared with 2014 was due to the corporate costs allocated to PPL Energy Supply (and included in discontinued operations) prior to the spin. As a result of the spinoff on June 1, 2015, these corporate costs now remain in continuing operations. \nStatement of Income Analysis --\nDepreciation\n (d) Recorded by KU. \n\n \u00b7 The decrease in cash from working capital was driven primarily by an increase in income tax receivable and a decrease of income tax payable from LKE as a result of the use of excess tax depreciation deductions, and an increase in inventory due to increased coal purchases in anticipation of a cold December similar to that of 2013, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to extended payment terms, higher rates and colder December weather in 2013 and an increase in accounts payable to affiliates. \n \u00b7 See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Margins - Changes in Margins\" for an explanation of Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins. \n(LKE)\n\n (c) Includes $6 million reduction of costs in 2015 due to the retirement of Cane Run units. \nIn comparing 2015 with 2014, cash used by investing activities increased primarily due to higher expenditures for environmental air projects at the Mill Creek plant, partially offset by lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7 which was put into commercial operation in June 2015.\n \u00b7 Higher interest expense in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the issuance of First Mortgage Bonds in July 2013 and June 2014. \nIn comparing 2015 with 2014, cash used by investing activities decreased primarily due to lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7 which was put into commercial operation in June 2015, and lower expenditures for environmental air projects and CCR projects at the Ghent and the E.W. Brown plants.\nStatement of Income Analysis --\nDistribution\n\n (b) The commitments under the domestic credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group, with no one bank and its affiliates providing an aggregate commitment of more than the following percentages of the total committed capacity: PPL - 13%, PPL Electric - 12%, LKE - 21%, LG&E - 12% and KU - 37%. \nAdditional employee-related costs incurred primarily included accelerated stock-based compensation and prorated performance-based cash incentive and stock-based compensation awards, primarily for PPL Energy Supply employees and for PPL Services employees who became PPL Energy Supply employees in connection with the transaction. PPL Energy Supply recognized $24 million of these costs at the spinoff closing date in 2015, which are reflected in discontinued operations.\nExcluding special items, higher earnings are projected in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily driven by electric and gas base rate increases effective July 1, 2015, and higher returns on additional environmental capital investments, partially offset by higher depreciation expense and higher financing costs.\n(Subsidiary Registrants)\n\nPPL's earnings by reportable segment were as follows:\n\n\"Margins\" is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that management utilizes as an indicator of the performance of its business. See PPL's \"Results of Operations - Margins\" for an explanation of why management believes this measure is useful and the underlying drivers of the changes between periods.

These methodologies included considering the closing \"when-issued\" Talen Energy market value on June 1, 2015 (the spinoff\n The U.K.'s Finance Act 2013, enacted in July 2013, reduced the U.K. statutory income tax rate from 23% to 21% effective April 1, 2014 and from 21% to 20% effective April 1, 2015. As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a $97 million deferred tax benefit in 2013 related to both rate decreases. \n (a) The syndicated credit facilities, as well as KU's letter of credit facility, each contain a financial covenant requiring debt to total capitalization not to exceed 70% for PPL Capital Funding, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU, as calculated in accordance with the facility, and other customary covenants. \n (c) Recorded at LKE. \nFor a description of the Registrants and their businesses, see \"Item 1. Business.\"\n (a) During 2015, PPL recorded $24 million of deferred income tax expense related to deferred tax valuation allowances. PPL recorded state deferred income tax expense of $12 million primarily related to increased Pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards expected to be unutilized and $12 million of federal deferred income tax expense primarily related to federal tax credit carryforwards that are expected to expire as a result of lower future taxable earnings due to the extension of bonus depreciation. \nIn November 2015, the U.K. Summer 2015 Budget was enacted, which reduces the U.K.'s statutory income tax rate from 20% to 19% effective April 1, 2017 and from 19% to 18% effective April 1, 2020. As a result of these changes, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a deferred tax benefit of approximately $90 million (4% effective tax rate impact) in 2015.\nThe changes in \"Notes receivable with affiliates, net\" resulted from proceeds of $150 million received in 2014 from repayments on a note extended in 2013.\n\n (b) Changes in state apportionment resulted in reductions to the future estimated state tax rate at December 31, 2014, and an increase to the future estimated state tax rate at December 31, 2013. PPL recorded an insignificant deferred tax benefit in 2014 and a $15 million deferred tax expense in 2013 related to its state deferred tax liabilities. \n\n \u00b7 Net income improved by $166 million between the periods, but included a decrease in net non-cash charges of $280 million. These net non-cash charges included a $238 million decrease in deferred income taxes and $65 million of changes to the WPD line loss accrual. These decreases in non-cash charges were partially offset by $110 million of lower unrealized gains on hedging activities. The net $114 million decrease from net income and non-cash adjustments between the periods was primarily due to lower margins from the U.K. Regulated segment, partially offset by higher margins from the Kentucky and Pennsylvania Regulated segments. \n\"Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins\" is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that management utilizes as an indicator of the performance of its business. See PPL's \"Results of Operations - Margins\" for information on why management believes this measure is useful and for explanations of the underlying drivers of the changes between periods.\nIn comparing 2014 with 2013, cash used by investing activities decreased as a result of the decrease in PP&E expenditures for KU, partially offset by the increase in PP&E expenditures for LG&E. The decrease in expenditures for KU was primarily due to lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7 and CCR projects at the Ghent and the E.W. Brown plants, partially offset by higher expenditures for environmental air projects at the Ghent and the E.W. Brown plants. The increase in expenditures for LG&E was primarily due to environmental air projects at the Mill Creek plant and the gas service riser program, partially offset by lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7.\nDistribution margins increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to returns on additional distribution improvement capital investments of $18 million and a $12 million benefit from a change in estimate of a regulatory liability.\nFollowing the announcement of the transaction to form Talen Energy, efforts were initiated to identify the appropriate staffing for Talen Energy and for PPL and its subsidiaries following completion of the spinoff. Organizational plans were substantially completed in 2014. The new organizational plans identified the need to resize and restructure the organizations and as a result, in 2014, estimated charges of $36 million for employee separation benefits were recorded related to 306 positions. Of this amount, $16 million related to 112 Energy Supply positions and is reflected in discontinued operations. The remaining $20 million is primarily reflected in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the PPL Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2015, the organizational structures were finalized for both PPL and Talen Energy which resulted in an additional charge of $10 million for employee separation benefits. Of this amount, $2 million related to Energy Supply positions and is reflected in discontinued operations. The remaining $8 million is reflected in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the PPL Consolidated Statements of Income. The separation benefits include cash severance compensation, lump sum COBRA reimbursement payments and outplacement services. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the recorded\nInterest expense increased by $14 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due the issuance of $550 million of incremental First Mortgage Bonds by LG&E and KU in September 2015 and higher interest rates on $500 million of First Mortgage Bonds refinanced by LG&E and KU.\nPPL recorded $45 million and $27 million of third-party costs related to this transaction in 2015 and 2014. Of these costs, $32 million and $19 million were primarily for bank advisory, legal and accounting fees to facilitate the transaction, and are reflected in discontinued operations. An additional $13 million and $8 million of consulting and other costs were incurred in 2015 and 2014, related to the formation of the Talen Energy organization and to reconfigure the remaining PPL service functions. These costs are recorded primarily in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income. No significant additional third-party costs are expected to be incurred.\n\n (b) As reported on the Statements of Income. \nLoss on Spinoff\n\nKU: Earnings, Margins and Statement of Income Analysis\nInterest Expense\nReconciliation of Earnings from Ongoing Operations\nKU had a $42 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared with 2014.\nThe increase (decrease) in income taxes was due to:\n \u00b7 The increase in cash from changes in working capital was driven primarily by a decrease in income tax receivable as a result of receiving payment from LKE in 2015 for the use of excess tax depreciation deductions in 2014, a decrease in accounts receivable from affiliates due to lower fuel costs for jointly owned units compared to an increase in the prior year, a decrease in accounts receivable due to milder weather in December 2015 compared to an increase in the prior year, a decrease in coal inventory as a result of the retirement of Cane Run coal units, and a decrease in natural gas stored underground due to lower gas prices in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of fuel purchases and payments compared to an increase in the prior year. \n\n(PPL's Corporate and Other Category)\nStatement of Income Analysis --\n\n\n(LKE)\n\nIn determining the control premium, PPL reviewed premiums received during the last five years in market sales transactions obtained from observable independent power producer and hybrid utility transactions greater than $1 billion. Premiums for these transactions ranged from 5% to 42% with a median of approximately 25%. Given these metrics, PPL concluded a control premium of 25% to be reasonable for both of the market valuation approaches used.\n\n(PPL's Kentucky Regulated Segment and LKE, LG&E and KU)\nFollowing the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, PPL completed its strategic transformation to a fully regulated business model consisting of seven diverse, high-performing utilities. These utilities are located in the U.K., Pennsylvania and Kentucky and each jurisdiction has different regulatory structures and customer classes. The Company believes this diverse portfolio provides strong earnings and dividend growth potential that will create significant value for its shareowners and positions PPL well for continued growth and success.\nAssumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis included forward energy prices, forecasted generation, and forecasted operation and maintenance expenditures that were consistent with assumptions used in the Energy Supply portion of the recent Talen Energy business planning process and a market participant discount rate.\n \u00b7 LG&E's non-cash components of net income included a $92 million increase in deferred income taxes primarily due to an increase in accelerated tax depreciation over book depreciation as a result of additional assets in service in 2014. \n\nThe following after-tax loss, which management considers a special item, impacted the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's results and is excluded from Earnings from Ongoing Operations.\nAlso as a result of the environmental requirements discussed above, LKE projects $1.9 billion ($1.0 billion at KU and $0.9 billion at LG&E) in environmental capital investment over the next five years. See PPL's \"Financial Condition - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures\", Note 6 and Note 13 for additional information.\nIn conjunction with the accounting for the spinoff, PPL evaluated whether the fair value of the Supply segment's net assets was less than the carrying value as of the June 1, 2015 spinoff date.\n \u00b7 The decrease in cash from KU's other operating activities was driven primarily by $43 million in proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps received in 2013. \n \u00b7 Pension funding was $70 million lower in 2014. \nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for PPL's definition of Earnings from Ongoing Operations as well as a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to Net Income.\n \u00b7 The decrease in cash from LG&E's other operating activities was driven primarily by $43 million in proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps received in 2013. \nInterest expense increased by $5 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the issuance of $250 million of incremental First Mortgage Bonds in September 2015 and higher interest rates on $250 million of First Mortgage Bonds refinanced by KU.\nU.S.\n (a) Represents an inventory write-down and separation benefits. \nAlthough rate base growth in the domestic utilities is expected to result in strong earnings growth for the foreseeable future, PPL does not expect significant earnings growth from the U.K. Regulated segment under the RIIO-ED1 price control period, which began on April 1, 2015. Although the U.K. Regulated segment also projects strong RAV growth, earnings from this segment are expected to be relatively flat from 2015 to 2017 during the transition to RIIO-ED1. Higher revenues resulting from the fast-track bonus are partially offset by higher levels of revenue profiling in the prior price control period (DPCR5) and a lower return on regulatory equity. In addition, starting in 2017, the amount of incentive revenues WPD is able to earn is expected to decline as a result of more stringent reliability and customer service targets established by Ofgem under RIIO-ED1. See \"Item 1. Business - General - Segment Information - U.K. Regulated Segment\" for additional information on revenues under RIIO-ED1.\nThe Registrants had the following at:\n\nThe remainder of this Item 7 in this Form 10-K is presented on a combined basis, providing information, as applicable, for all Registrants.\nto timing of fuel purchases and payments and unfavorable weather in 2015) partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable (primarily due to unfavorable weather in 2015).\n \u00b7 The decrease in cash from KU's other operating activities was driven primarily by $44 million in payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps. \n (c) The increase in 2014 compared with 2013 was due to more storm events. \ndate) adjusted for the proportional share of the equity value attributable to the Supply segment, as well as the valuation methods consistently used in PPL's goodwill impairment assessments - an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis of the Supply segment and an alternative market approach considering market multiples of comparable companies.\n\n(All Registrants)\ncontinuing to study the project and may modify it in the future. The capital expenditures related to this project are excluded from the Capital Expenditures table included in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Forecasted Uses of Cash\" below.\nDuring 2013, PPL recorded $23 million of state deferred income tax expense related to a deferred tax valuation allowance primarily due to a decrease in projected future taxable income at PPL Energy Supply over the remaining carryforward period of Pennsylvania net operating losses.\nEarnings\n\nIn comparing 2014 with 2013, cash provided by financing activities decreased as a result of the $250 million long-term debt issued in November 2013, a decrease of contributions from LKE and higher dividends to LKE.\nMargins\n(All Registrants)\n (b) As reported on the Statements of Income. \n \u00b7 Net income decreased by $11 million between the periods and included an additional $181 million of net non-cash charges, primarily due to increases in deferred tax expense and depreciation. \n (c) Each company pays customary fees under its respective syndicated credit facility, as does KU under its letter of credit facility, and borrowings generally bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus an applicable margin. \n \u00b7 KU's non-cash components of net income included a $155 million increase in deferred income taxes primarily due to the utilization of net operating losses and an increase in accelerated tax depreciation over book depreciation as a result of additional assets in service in 2014. \nThe components of the change in cash provided by (used in) operating activities were as follows.\n\n (c) During 2015, PPL recorded a $12 million tax benefit related to the settlement of the IRS audit for the tax years 1998-2011. \n (b) Includes $5 million of Cane Run 7 operations partially offset by $2 million reduction of costs in 2015 due to the retirement of Green River units. \nExcluding a special item, earnings decreased for 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by returns on additional transmission and distribution improvement capital investments and the release of a gross receipts tax reserve.\nAs a result of the June 2014 spinoff announcement, PPL recorded $50 million of deferred income tax expense in 2014, to adjust valuation allowances on deferred tax assets primarily for state net operating loss carryforwards that were previously supported by the future earnings of PPL Energy Supply.\n (b) As reported on the Statements of Income. \nThe changes in the components of the U.K. Regulated segment's results between these periods were due to the factors set forth below, which reflect amounts classified as U.K. Gross Margins, the items that management considers special and the effects of movements in foreign currency exchange, including the effects of foreign currency hedge contracts, on separate lines and not in their respective Statement of Income line items.\n(PPL)\nExcluding a special item, earnings increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to returns on additional transmission and distribution improvement capital investments, lower other operation and maintenance expense and a benefit from a change in estimate of a regulatory liability, partially offset by higher interest expense and depreciation expense.\nThe businesses of LKE, LG&E and KU are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to CCRs, GHG, ELGs, MATS and the Clean Power Plan. See \"Financial Condition - Environmental Matters\" below for additional information on the CCRs requirements and Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the other significant environmental matters. These and other stringent environmental requirements have led PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU to retire approximately 800 megawatts of coal-fired generating plants in Kentucky. In September 2015, KU retired two coal-fired units, with a combined summer capacity rating of 161 MW, at the Green River plant. LG&E retired a 240 MW coal-fired unit in March 2015 and two additional coal-fired units, with a combined summer capacity rating of 323 MW, in June 2015 at the Cane Run plant. KU retired a 71 MW coal-fired unit at the Tyrone plant in 2013. The retirement of these units is not expected to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU.\nIn 2013, financing activities also included net cash contributions of $1.2 billion from PPL to PPL Energy Supply (discontinued operations) to fund debt maturities, to repay short-term debt and to terminate the operating lease arrangement for interests in the Montana Colstrip facility and acquire the previously leased interests.\nUsing these methodologies and weightings, PPL determined the estimated fair value of the Supply segment (classified as Level 3) was below its carrying value of $4.1 billion and recorded a loss on the spinoff of $879 million in the second quarter of 2015, which is reflected in discontinued operations and is nondeductible for tax purposes. This amount served to reduce the basis of the net assets accounted for as a dividend at the June 1, 2015 spinoff date.\nEarnings\n\nLG&E had a $5 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared with 2013.\nIn June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply executed definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to spin off PPL Energy Supply and immediately combine it with Riverstone's competitive power generation businesses to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy. On June 1, 2015, the spinoff was completed.

As such, PPL also considered the other valuation approaches in estimating the overall fair value, but ultimately assigned the highest weighting to the Talen Energy market value approach.\nFor PPL, lower project expenditures at WPD and KU were partially offset by higher project expenditures at PPL Electric and LG&E. The decrease in expenditures for WPD was primarily due to a decrease in expenditures to enhance system reliability associated with the end of the DPCR5 price control period and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in expenditures for KU was related to lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7 which was put into commercial operation in June 2015, and lower expenditures for environmental air projects and CCR projects at KU's Ghent and E.W. Brown plants. The increase in expenditures for PPL Electric was primarily due to the Northeast Pocono reliability project, smart grid projects and other various projects, partially offset by the completion of the Susquehanna-Roseland transmission project. The increase in expenditures for LG&E was primarily due to environmental air projects at LG&E's Mill Creek plant, partially offset by lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7.\n (a) In June 2014, PPL Electric's largest IBEW local ratified a new three-year labor agreement. In connection with the new agreement, bargaining unit one-time voluntary retirement benefits were recorded. \nPPL recorded a tax benefit of $7 million during 2013 to federal and state income tax reserves related to stranded cost securitization. The reserve balance at December 31, 2013 related to stranded costs securitization was zero.\n \u00b7 \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies\" provides an overview of the accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of the Registrants and that require their management to make significant estimates, assumptions and other judgments of inherently uncertain matters. \n(PPL)\n(All Registrants)\nEarnings generated by PPL's U.K. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk. The U.K. subsidiaries also have currency exposure to the U.S. dollar to the extent of their U.S. dollar denominated debt. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and cross currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency exchange contracts.\nEarnings\nInterest Expense\nIn December 2013, WPD and other U.K. DNOs announced agreements with the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change and Ofgem to a reduction of \u00a35 per residential customer of electricity distribution revenues that otherwise would have been collected in the regulatory year beginning April 1, 2014. Full recovery of the revenue reduction, together with the associated carrying cost will occur in the regulatory year beginning April 1, 2016. Under GAAP, WPD does not record a receivable for under recovery of regulated income (which this reduction represents), as a result earnings for the U.K. Regulated segment were adversely affected by $15 million in 2015 and $31 million in 2014. PPL projects earnings in 2016 will be positively affected by $32 million and earnings for 2017 will be positively affected by $17 million.\n\n \u00b7 Lower other operation and maintenance in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to $38 million from lower pension expense. \n (a) Includes net increase (decrease) in notes payable with affiliates. \n The increase in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to debt issuances at WPD (West Midlands) in October 2013, LG&E and KU in November 2013 and PPL Electric in June 2014 and July 2013. \n(PPL's Pennsylvania Regulated Segment and PPL Electric)\nLong-term debt and equity securities activity for 2015 included:\n (c) 2015, 2014 and 2013 exclude $46 million, $48 million and $44 million of ancillary activity revenues. 2014 and 2013 also exclude $65 million and $45 million of revenue reductions related to adjustments to WPD's line loss accrual related to DPCR4 which are considered special items. \n2016 Outlook\n \u00b7 See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Margins - Changes in Margins\" for an explanation of U.K. Gross Margins. \n\nThe following Statement of Income line items and their related increase (decrease) are included above within \"Margins\" and are not discussed separately.\nPPL plans to issue not more than $200 million of common stock in 2016.\nInterest expense increased by $8 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the issuance of $300 million of incremental First Mortgage Bonds in September 2015 and higher interest rates on $250 million of First Mortgage Bonds refinanced by LG&E.\nInterest expense increased by $22 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the issuance of $500 million of First Mortgage Bonds in November 2013 and higher short-term debt balances in 2014.\nInterest expense increased by $7 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the issuance of $250 million of First Mortgage Bonds in November 2013.\n \u00b7 \"Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins\" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity transmission and distribution delivery operations of the Pennsylvania Regulated segment and PPL Electric. In calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a PLR, are offset with minimal impact on earnings. Costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in \"Energy purchases,\" \"Other operation and maintenance,\" (which are primarily Act 129 and Universal Service program costs), and \"Taxes, other than income,\" which is primarily gross receipts tax. This performance measure includes PLR energy purchases by PPL Electric from PPL EnergyPlus, which are reflected in \"Energy purchases from affiliate\" in the reconciliation tables. As a result of the June 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply and the formation of Talen Energy, PPL EnergyPlus (renamed Talen Energy Marketing) is no longer an affiliate of PPL Electric. PPL Electric's purchases from Talen Energy Marketing subsequent to May 31, 2015 are reflected in \"Energy Purchases\" in the reconciliation tables. This measure represents the net revenues from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's and PPL Electric's electricity delivery operations. \n\nPPL received $136 million during 2015 from the sale of short-term investments.\nThe table below quantifies the changes in the components of Net Income between these periods, which reflect amounts classified as Margins and certain items that management considers special on separate lines within the table and not in their respective Statement of Income line items. See PPL's \"Results of Operations - Segment Earnings - Kentucky Regulated segment\" for details of these special items.\n \u00b7 Higher depreciation for both periods primarily due to transmission and distribution additions to PP&E, net, related to the ongoing efforts to improve reliability and replace aging infrastructure. \nOther Operation and Maintenance\n \u00b7 Pension funding was $10 million higher in 2015. \n\n\nThe following tables contain the components from the Statements of Income that are included in this non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to \"Operating Income.\"\nSee Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information related to the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, including the components of Discontinued Operations.\n (a) The increase in 2015 compared with 2014 is attributed to the change in mortality tables and lower discount rates. \n \u00b7 The decrease in cash from LKE's other operating activities was driven primarily by $88 million in payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps. \nOther income (expense) - net increased $3 million in 2015 compared with 2014 and increased $160 million in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to changes in realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency contracts to economically hedge GBP denominated earnings from WPD.\nInvesting Activities\nTransmission margins increased for both periods, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments focused on replacing the aging infrastructure and improving reliability.\n (b) As reported on the Statements of Income. \n\nCertain Operating Revenues and Expenses Included in \"Margins\"\n In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the December 2011 ruling, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, concerning the creditability of U.K. Windfall Profits Tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result of this decision, PPL recorded a tax benefit of $44 million during 2013. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n\nIn comparing 2014 with 2013, cash used by investing activities decreased as a result of the decrease in expenditures primarily due to lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7 and CCR projects at the Ghent and the E.W.

Brown plants.\nATM Program (PPL)\nIntercompany (LKE, LG&E and KU)\n \u00b7 LKE's non-cash components of net income included a $213 million decrease in deferred income taxes, partially offset by a $28 million increase in depreciation due to additional assets in service in 2015. Deferred income taxes were lower in 2015 as a large portion of the effect of accelerated tax depreciation did not result in cash as a result of the Federal net operating losses. \nDepreciation\n \u00b7 Net income improved by $54 million between the periods. However, this included an additional $53 million of net non-cash benefits, primarily due to a decrease in deferred income tax expense. \nThe increase (decrease) in interest expense was due to:\n(LG&E)\n(All Registrants)\nThe following tables contain after-tax gains (losses), in total, which management considers special items, that are excluded from Earnings from Ongoing Operations and a reconciliation to PPL's \"Net Income (Loss)\" for the years ended December 31.\n (a) LG&E and KU participate in an intercompany agreement whereby LKE, LG&E and/or KU make available funds up to $500 million at an interest rate based on a market index of commercial paper issues. However, the FERC has authorized a maximum aggregate short-term debt limit for each utility at $500 million from all covered sources. \n\nThe changes in the components of the Kentucky Regulated segment's results between these periods were due to the factors set forth below, which reflect amounts classified as Kentucky Gross Margins and the items that management considers special on separate lines and not in their respective Statement of Income line item.\n (a) Recorded at LKE and represents a valuation allowance against tax credits expiring in 2016 through 2020 that are more likely than not to expire before being utilized. \n \u00b7 Higher other operation and maintenance for 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to $30 million of higher corporate service costs allocated to PPL Electric, $11 million of higher vegetation management expenses and related costs for additional work done by outside vendors and $5 million of higher bad debt expenses. \n\nLKE had a $64 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared with 2014.\nA key assumption included in the fair value estimate is the application of a control premium of 25% in the two market approaches. PPL concluded it was appropriate to apply a control premium in these approaches as the goodwill impairment testing guidance was followed in determining the estimated fair value of the Supply segment, which had historically been a reporting unit for PPL. This guidance provides that the market price of an individual security (and thus the market capitalization of a reporting unit with publically traded equity securities) may not be representative of the fair value of the reporting unit. This guidance also indicates that substantial value may arise to a controlling shareholder from the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that arise from control over another entity, and that the market price of a Company's individual share of stock does not reflect this additional value to a controlling shareholder. Therefore, the quoted market price need not be the sole measurement basis for determining the fair value, and including a control premium is appropriate in measuring the fair value of a reporting unit.\n \u00b7 Higher other operation and maintenance in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to $14 million of higher pension expense and $11 million of higher costs related to the Cane Run units' retirements consisting of an inventory write-down and separation benefits, partially offset by $7 million of lower storm costs and lower bad debt expense of $6 million. \n \u00b7 The $341 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to a decrease in taxes payable (primarily due to a decrease in current income tax expense in 2015), a decrease in accounts payable (primarily due \nThe components of the change in cash provided by (used in) financing activities were as follows.\nDiscontinued Operations\n\n \u00b7 Higher depreciation in 2014 compared with 2013 due to additions to PP&E, net. \nDepreciation increased by $29 million in 2015 compared with 2014, and by $7 million in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to additions to PP&E, net, related to the ongoing efforts to improve reliability and replace aging infrastructure.\n (a) Management considers this a special item. See PPL's \"Results of Operations - Segment Earnings - Kentucky Regulated Segment\" for details of this item. \n\n\n(PPL)\n (b) The U.K. Finance Acts of 2015 and 2013 reduced the U.K.'s statutory income tax rates. As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liability and recognized a deferred tax benefit in 2015 and 2013. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u00b7 The decrease in cash from working capital was driven primarily by an increase in income tax receivable from LKE as a result of the use of excess tax depreciation deductions, and an increase in accounts receivable from affiliates, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to extended payment terms, higher rates and colder December weather in 2013. \n\nInterest expense increased by $8 million in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to debt issuances in October 2015 and June 2014. Interest expense increased by $14 million in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to debt issuances in June 2014 and July 2013.\n (b) The increase in 2015 compared with 2014 was due to higher corporate support costs charged to Electric Utilities, primarily as a result of the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply. \nThe following should be read in conjunction with the Registrants' Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes.

The changes in sales volumes were driven by unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014.\n During 2013, PPL recorded $28 million of income tax expense resulting from increased taxable dividends offset by a $19 million income tax benefit associated with a ruling obtained from the IRS impacting the recalculation of 2010 U.K. earnings and profits that was reflected on an amended 2010 U.S. tax return. \nIn comparing 2014 with 2013, cash provided by financing activities increased due to an increase in short-term debt to fund capital expenditures and an increase in contributions from LKE, offset by the $250 million of long-term debt issued in November 2013.\n\nStatement of Income Analysis --\nPPL's businesses of WPD, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU plan to achieve this growth by providing efficient, reliable and safe operations and strong customer service, maintaining constructive regulatory relationships and achieving timely recovery of costs. These businesses are expected to achieve strong, long-term growth in rate base and RAV, as applicable, driven by planned significant capital expenditures to maintain existing assets and improve system reliability and, for LKE, LG&E and KU, to comply with federal and state environmental regulations related to coal-fired electricity generation facilities. Additionally, significant transmission rate base growth is expected through 2020 at PPL Electric.\nLG&E had a $183 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared with 2014.\n\nRate Case Proceedings (LKE, LG&E and KU)\n (c) The decrease in 2014 compared with 2013 was due to lower headcount, less maintenance work and more focus on capital projects in 2014. \nExcluding special items, higher earnings are expected in 2016 compared with 2015. This increase is primarily attributable to increases in the Kentucky Regulated and Pennsylvania Regulated segments. The following projections and factors underlying these projections (on an after-tax basis) are provided for PPL's segments and the Corporate and Other category and the related Registrants.\nFinancial Condition\nCertain Operating Revenues and Expenses Included in \"Margins\"\nThe increase (decrease) in income taxes was due to:\nTaxes, Other Than Income\n\nFollowing the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, PPL has no continuing ownership interest in or control of Talen Energy and Talen Energy Supply (formerly, PPL Energy Supply).\nKentucky Regulated Segment\n (d) During 2015, PPL recorded lower income taxes primarily due to a decrease in taxable dividends. \n (b) Issuances include a $400 million note with PPL Capital Funding.

The application is based on a fully projected future test year of January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. On September 3, 2015, PPL Electric filed with the PUC Administrative Law Judge a petition for approval of a settlement agreement resolving all issues in the case. On November 19, 2015, the PUC issued its final order approving the settlement agreement. Under that agreement, PPL Electric was permitted to increase its annual distribution rates by $124 million, effective January 1, 2016.\nThe Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of LKE's regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of LG&E and KU, as well as LG&E's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas. In addition, certain financing costs are allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment. The Kentucky Regulated segment represents 20% of PPL's Income from Continuing Operations After Income Taxes for 2015 and 35% of PPL's assets at December 31, 2015.\n(KU)\n \u00b7 The decrease in cash from LG&E's other operating activities was driven primarily by $44 million in payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps. \nThe Registrants maintain credit facilities to enhance liquidity, provide credit support and provide a backstop to commercial paper programs. Amounts borrowed under these credit facilities are reflected in \"Short-term debt\" on the Balance Sheets.

These bonds continue to experience failed auctions and the interest rate continues to be set by a formula pursuant to the relevant indentures. For the period ended December 31, 2015, the weighted-average rate on LG&E's and KU's auction rate bonds in total was 0.22% (0.20% at LG&E and 0.24% at KU).\nThe following Statement of Income line items and their related increase (decrease) are included above within \"Margins\" and are not discussed separately.\n \u00b7 Lower other operation and maintenance for 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to $16 million of lower payroll related expenses due to lower headcount, less maintenance projects and more focus on capital work in 2014. \n\nTaxes, other than income decreased by $13 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the settlement of a 2011 gross receipts tax audit resulting in the reversal of $17 million of previously recognized reserves.\n \u00b7 The $166 million decrease in cash from other operating activities was partially due to net proceeds of $104 million for settlement in 2013 of forward starting interest rate swaps. \nAs discussed above, a key component of this strategy is to maintain constructive relationships with our regulators in all jurisdictions in which we operate (U.K., U.S. federal and state). This is supported by our strong culture of integrity and delivering on commitments to our customers, regulators and shareowners, and a commitment to continue to improve our customer service, reliability and efficiency of operations.\nEarnings (PPL)\nEarnings in 2015 compared with 2014 increased primarily due to higher base rates and returns on additional environmental capital investments partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and lower sales volume. The increases in base rates were the result of new rates approved by the KPSC effective July 1, 2015. The change in sales volume were due to milder weather during the fourth quarter of 2015.\nThe increase (decrease) in other operation and maintenance was due to:\nSegment Earnings\n (b) The increase in 2015 compared with 2014 is attributed to the change in mortality tables and lower discount rates. \n(PPL)\nKentucky Gross Margins increased in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to returns on additional environmental capital investments of $55 million ($27 million at LG&E and $28 million at KU) and higher volumes of $13 million ($5 million at LG&E and $8 million at KU). The change in volumes was driven by unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014.\n (a) The decrease in 2015 compared with 2014 was primarily due to the settlement of the 2011 gross receipts tax audit resulting in the reversal of $17 million of previously recognized reserves. \n\n\nSpinoff of PPL Energy Supply\n \u00b7 \"Overview\" provides a description of each Registrant's business strategy, a description of key factors expected to impact future earnings and a discussion of important financial and operational developments. \n\u2022 Acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments.\nOn June 30, 2015, the KPSC approved a rate case settlement agreement providing for increases in the annual revenue requirements associated with KU base electricity rates of $125 million and LG&E base gas rates of $7 million. The annual revenue requirement associated with base electricity rates at LG&E was not changed. Although the settlement did not establish a specific return on equity with respect to the base rates, an authorized 10% return on equity will be utilized in the ECR and GLT mechanisms. The settlement agreement provides for deferred recovery of costs associated with KU's retirement of Green River Units 3 and 4. The new regulatory asset will be amortized over three years. The settlement also provides regulatory asset treatment for the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with LG&E and KU's pension accounting policy and pension expense using a 15 year amortization period for actuarial gains and losses. The new rates and all elements of the settlement became effective July 1, 2015.\nLong-term Debt and Equity Securities\n\nPPL Segment Earnings, Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Statement of Income Analysis\nIncome taxes increased by $11 million in 2015 compared with 2014 and increased by $9 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the change in pre-tax income at current period tax rates.\n(PPL)\n(All Registrants)\nThe Registrants expect to continue to have adequate liquidity available from operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities and commercial paper issuances. Additionally, subject to market conditions, the Registrants and their subsidiaries may access the capital markets, and PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU anticipate receiving equity contributions from their parent or member in 2016.\n \u00b7 Net income improved by $69 million between the periods. This included an additional $124 million of net non-cash charges, including a $279 million increase in deferred income tax expense. These non-cash charges were partially offset by $243 million of higher unrealized gains on hedging activities. \n \u00b7 \"Results of Operations\" for PPL provides a detailed analysis of earnings by segment, and for PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU, includes a summary of earnings. For all Registrants, \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\", \"Earnings from Ongoing Operations\" and \"Margins\" provide explanations of non-GAAP measures used and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. \"Statement of Income Analysis\" addresses significant changes in principal line items on the Statements of Income, comparing 2015 with 2014 and 2014 with 2013. \n\nIncome Taxes\nPPL Electric is currently authorized to incur, subject to market conditions, up to approximately $500 million of long-term indebtedness in 2016, the proceeds of which would be used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes.\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n(LKE)\nCertain Operating Revenues and Expenses Included in \"Margins\"\nEarnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items.

The following commercial paper programs were in place at:\nThe following Statement of Income line items are included above within \"Margins\" and are not discussed separately.\nIn September 2013, KU filed an application with the FERC to adjust the formula rate under which KU provided wholesale requirements power sales to 12 municipal customers. Among other changes, the application requests an amended formula whereby KU would charge cost-based rates with a subsequent true-up to actual costs, replacing the current formula which does not include a true-up. KU's application proposed an authorized return on equity of 10.7%. Certain elements, including the new formula rate, became effective April 23, 2014, subject to refund. In April 2014, nine municipalities submitted notices of termination, under the original notice period provisions, to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements contracts. Such terminations are to be effective in 2019, except in the case of one municipality with a 2017 effective date. In addition, a tenth municipality has become a transmission-only customer as of June 2015. In July 2014, KU agreed on settlement terms with the two municipal customers that did not provide termination notices and filed the settlement proposal with the FERC for its approval. In August 2014, the FERC issued an order on the interim settlement agreement allowing the proposed rates to become effective pending a final order. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the FERC approved the settlement agreement resolving the rate case with respect to these two municipalities, including approval of the formula rate with a true-up provision and authorizing a return on equity of 10% or the return on equity awarded to other parties in this case, whichever is lower. In August 2015, KU filed a partial settlement agreement with the nine terminating municipalities, resolving all but one open matter with one municipality. The settlement was approved by FERC in the fourth quarter of 2015, including authorizing the agreed-upon refunds, approving the formula rate with a true-up provision, and authorizing a 10.25% return on equity. Refunds to both the remaining municipals and the departing municipals were issued during the fourth quarter of 2015 totaling $3.4 million. A single remaining unresolved issue with one terminating municipality is in FERC litigation proceedings. Hearings on the dispute were conducted in January 2016 and preliminary rulings on the matter may occur in mid- or late-2016. KU cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this remaining FERC proceeding, but the amounts under continuing dispute are not estimated to be significant.\nIn 2014, financing activities also included net cash distributions of $1.2 billion to PPL from PPL Energy Supply (discontinued operations) for the proceeds from the PPL Montana hydroelectric generation facilities sale, net of a tax liability payment and proceeds from a tax grant.\nU.K. Gross Margins excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to $194 million from the April 1, 2014 and 2013 price increases, partially offset by $88 million from lower volumes due primarily to weather.\n(PPL Electric)\nThe following table summarizes PPL's fair value analysis:\nThe assets and liabilities of PPL's Supply segment for all periods prior to the spinoff are included in \"Current assets of discontinued operations\", \"Noncurrent assets of discontinued operations\", \"Current liabilities of discontinued operations\" and \"Noncurrent liabilities of discontinued operations\" on PPL's Balance Sheet.\n (b) Costs were lower in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to the benefits of corporate restructuring. Costs were higher in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to higher long-term debt interest expense. \n (a) Issuances are net of pricing discounts, where applicable and exclude the impact of debt issuance costs. \nThe table below quantifies the changes in the components of Net Income between these periods, which reflect amounts classified as Margins within the table and not in their respective Statement of Income line items.\nEffective January 1, 2015, after completing a review of the useful lives of its distribution network assets, WPD extended the weighted average useful lives of these assets to 69 years from 55 years for GAAP reporting of depreciation expense. For 2015, this change in useful lives resulted in lower depreciation expense of $84 million ($66 million after-tax or $0.10 per share).\nIn 2014, PPL Electric required $75 million less cash from financing activities to support its significant capital expenditure program, primarily due to the receipt of $150 million on notes receivable from affiliates (as described in \"Investing Activities\" above) and improvements in cash from operations of $90 million.\n\n (a) Represents amounts excluded from Margins. \n\nSee \"Forecasted Uses of Cash\" for detail regarding projected capital expenditures for the years 2016 through 2020.\n (a) At December 31, 2015, $447 million of cash and cash equivalents were denominated in GBP. If these amounts would be remitted as dividends, PPL would not anticipate a material incremental U.S. tax cost. Historically, dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries have been limited to distributions of the current year's earnings. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information on undistributed earnings of WPD. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures including \"Earnings from Ongoing Operations\" and \"Gross Margins\" as further described below.\nThe increase (decrease) in taxes, other than income was due to:\n\u2022 Unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency-related economic hedges.\n\nPPL paid $120 million during 2014 from the purchase of short-term investments.\nLong-term Debt and Equity Securities\n\nIn comparing 2015 with 2014, cash used by investing activities increased as a result of receiving payment from PPL in 2014 for the notes receivable issued in 2013, partially offset by lower PP&E\nInterest Expense\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\nU.K.\nTransmission\n (e) The U.K.'s Finance Act 2015, enacted in November 2015, reduces the U.K. statutory income tax rate from 20% to 19% effective April 1, 2017 and from 19% to 18% effective April 1, 2020. As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a $90 million deferred tax benefit in 2015 related to both rate decreases. \nIn comparing 2014 with 2013, cash used by investing activities increased as a result of the increase in expenditures primarily due to environmental air projects at the Mill Creek plant and the gas service riser program, partially offset by lower expenditures for the construction of Cane Run Unit 7.\n \u00b7 \"U.K. Gross Margins\" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity distribution operations of the U.K. Regulated segment. In calculating this measure, direct costs such as National Grid connection charges and Ofgem license fees (recorded in \"Other operations and maintenance expense\" on the Statement of Income) are deducted from operating revenues as they are costs passed through to customers. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from the delivery of electricity across WPD's distribution network in the U.K. and directly related activities. \n (a) The increase in 2015 compared with 2014 is primarily due to 2015 including interest expense related to certain PPL Energy Funding debt that was previously associated with PPL's Supply segment and included in \"Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes) in 2014. \nIncome Taxes\n \u00b7 Lower taxes, other than income for 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the settlement of a 2011 gross receipts tax audit resulting in the reversal of $17 million of previously recognized reserves. \n\n\"Margins\" is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that management utilizes as an indicator of the performance of its business. See PPL's \"Results of Operations - Margins\" for an explanation of why management believes this measure is useful and the underlying drivers of the changes between periods. Within PPL's discussion, LG&E's Margins are included in \"Kentucky Gross Margins.\"\n \u00b7 \"Kentucky Gross Margins\" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of the Kentucky Regulated segment, LKE, LG&E and KU, as well as the Kentucky Regulated segment's, LKE's and LG&E's distribution and sale of natural gas. In calculating this measure, fuel, energy purchases and certain variable costs of production (recorded as \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income) are deducted from revenues. In addition, certain other expenses, recorded as \"Other operation and maintenance\", \"Depreciation\" and \"Taxes, other than income\" on the Statements of Income, associated with approved cost recovery mechanisms are offset against the recovery of those expenses, which are included in revenues. These mechanisms allow for direct recovery of these expenses and, in some cases, returns on capital investments and performance incentives. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from electricity and gas operations. \nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31 and the changes between periods were as follows.\n (a) Represents amounts excluded from Margins. \nThe Statements of Cash Flows separately report the cash flows of the discontinued operations.

In February 2014, Ofgem published formal confirmation that WPD's Business Plans submitted by its four DNOs under RIIO-ED1 were accepted as submitted, or \"fast-tracked.\" Fast tracking afforded several benefits to the WPD DNOs including the ability to collect additional revenue equivalent to 2.5% of Totex during the eight-year price control period (approximately $43 million annually), greater revenue certainty and a higher level of cost savings retention.

See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information. \nKentucky Gross Margins\n\nOn March 31, 2015, PPL Electric filed a petition requesting a waiver of the DSIC cap of 5% of billed revenues and approval to increase the maximum allowable DSIC from 5% to 7.5% for service rendered after January 1, 2016. PPL Electric filed the petition concurrently with its 2015 rate case and the Administrative Law Judge granted PPL Electric's request to consolidate these two proceedings. Under the terms of the settlement agreement discussed above, PPL Electric agreed to withdraw the petition without prejudice to filing it at a later date.\nThis \"Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" is separately filed by PPL Corporation, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU. Information contained herein relating to any individual Registrant is filed by such Registrant solely on its own behalf, and no Registrant makes any representation as to information relating to any other Registrant. The specific Registrant to which disclosures are applicable is identified in parenthetical headings in italics above the applicable disclosure or within the applicable disclosure for each Registrant's related activities and disclosures. Within combined disclosures, amounts are disclosed for any Registrant when significant.\n \u00b7 Higher income taxes in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to a $19 million increase primarily in taxable dividends and a $19 million benefit in 2013 related to an IRS ruling regarding 2010 U.K. earnings and profits calculations. \n(All Registrants)\n (a) Represents amounts excluded from Margins. \nIn addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, the credit agreements governing the above credit facilities contain various other covenants. Failure to comply with the covenants after applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of repayment of borrowings and/or termination of the agreements. The Registrants monitor compliance with the covenants on a regular basis. At December 31, 2015, the Registrants were in compliance with these covenants. At this time, the Registrants believe that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to these funding sources.\n (b) As reported on the Statements of Income. \n \u00b7 The decrease in cash from LKE's other operating activities was driven primarily by $86 million in proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps received in 2013. \nPPL and its subsidiaries are currently authorized to incur, subject to market conditions, up to approximately $2 billion of long-term indebtedness in 2016, the proceeds of which would be used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes.\n\nThe following tables contain the components from the Statement of Income that are included in the non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to PPL's \"Operating Income\" for the years ended December 31.\nDepreciation increased by $23 million in 2015 compared with 2014 and by $11 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to additions to PP&E, net.\nForecasted Sources of Cash\nRegulatory Requirements\nU.K. Depreciation\n \u00b7 LG&E's non-cash components of net income included an $8 million increase in deferred income taxes and a $5 million increase in depreciation due to additional assets in service in 2015. \nThe following tables contain the components from the Statements of Income that are included in this non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to \"Operating Income.\"\n(PPL Electric)\nDepreciation\nThe changes in the components of the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's results between these periods were due to the factors set forth below, which reflect amounts classified as Pennsylvania Gross Delivery Margins and the item that management considers special on separate lines and not in their respective Statement of Income line item.\n\n (a) Effective January 1, 2015, after completion of a review of the useful lives of its distribution network assets, WPD extended the weighted average useful lives of these assets to 69 years from 55 years resulting in lower depreciation of $84 million ($66 million after-tax or $0.10 per share). \nU.K. Gross Margins\n (b) The increase in 2015 compared with 2014 is attributed to the change in mortality tables and lower discount rates. \nThe Pennsylvania Regulated segment includes the regulated electricity transmission and distribution operations of PPL Electric. The Pennsylvania Regulated segment represents 16% of PPL's Income from Continuing Operations After Income Taxes for 2015 and 22% of PPL's assets at December 31, 2015.\n\n (a) Represents amounts excluded from Margins. \n(All Registrants)\nEarnings in 2015 compared with 2014 increased primarily due to returns on additional environmental capital investments partially offset by higher income taxes, financing costs and lower sales volume. The change in sales volume was due to milder weather during the fourth quarter of 2015.\n \u00b7 Higher other operation and maintenance in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to $14 million of higher expenses due to the timing and scope of scheduled generation maintenance outages, $9 million of higher bad debt expense and higher storm expenses of $8 million. \nCommercial Paper (All Registrants)\n (f) The decrease in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to lower amortization of prior period losses and an increase in expected asset returns. \n\nPPL had a $494 million increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2014 compared with 2013.\nIncome taxes increased by $5 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the change in pre-tax income at current period tax rates.\n\nPPL had a $669 million decrease in cash from operating activities from continuing operations in 2015 compared with 2014.\n \u00b7 Higher income taxes in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to higher pre-tax income. \nSee \"Results of Operations\" below for further discussion of PPL's results of operations, details of special items by reportable segments and analysis of the consolidated results of operations.\nIn 2015, PPL Electric required $28 million less cash from financing activities due to the use of cash on hand which helped support the significant capital expenditure program.\nIn June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply executed definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to spin off PPL Energy Supply and immediately combine it with Riverstone's competitive power generation businesses to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy. In June 2015, the spinoff was completed. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information relating to the transaction.\nU.K. Gross Margins excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to $171 million from the April 1, 2015 price decrease resulting from the commencement of RIIO-ED1, partially offset by $46 million from the April 1, 2014 price increase.\nFERC Wholesale Formula Rates (LKE and KU)\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 295: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 vs. 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 vs. 2013 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>
