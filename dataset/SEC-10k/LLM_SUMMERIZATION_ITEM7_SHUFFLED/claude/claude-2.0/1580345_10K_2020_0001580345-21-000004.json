Important assumptions include, without limitation, our ability to originate new loans and investments, borrowing costs and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nOur shares are currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE\u201d) under the symbol TPVG\u201d. The 2022 Notes are currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol TPVY\u201d.\nWe were formed to expand the venture growth stage business segment of TPC's investment platform. TPC is widely recognized as a leading global financing provider devoted to serving venture capital-backed companies with creative, flexible and customized debt financing, equity capital and complementary services throughout their lifespan. TPC is located on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley and has a primary focus in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries.\nOur investment objective is to maximize our total return to stockholders primarily in the form of current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by lending primarily with warrants to venture growth stage companies focused in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries backed by TPC's select group of leading venture capital investors.\nCOVID-19 Developments\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and the related effect on the U.S. and global economies, including the recent economic downturn and the uncertainty associated with the timing and likelihood of economic recovery, has had adverse consequences for the business operations of some of our portfolio companies and has adversely affected, and threatens to continue to adversely affect, our operations and the operations of the Adviser.\nWhile we have been monitoring, and continue to monitor, the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our and our portfolio companies' business, we have continued to raise capital, maintain appropriate levels of available liquidity, support and monitor our existing portfolio companies, fund existing unfunded commitments, and selectively deploy capital in new investment opportunities in venture growth stage companies. As a result of our focus on maintaining adequate liquidity amid current market uncertainty, our interest expense has increased from comparable prior year periods due to maintaining a higher weighted average outstanding principal balance on borrowings and increased cash reserves.\nWe have seen, and expect to continue to see, certain of our portfolio companies experience financial distress and, depending on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent of its disruption to operations, expect that certain of our portfolio companies may default on their financial obligations to us and their other capital providers. In addition, as a result of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related disruption and financial distress, certain portfolio companies may seek to modify their loans from us, which could reduce the amount or extend the time for payment of principal, reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest, and/or increase the amount of PIK interest we receive with respect to such investment, among other things. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have also impeded, and may continue to impede, the ability of certain of our portfolio companies to raise additional capital and/or pursue asset sales or otherwise execute strategic transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on the valuation of our investments in such companies. Portfolio companies operating in certain industries may be more susceptible to these risks than other portfolio companies in other industries in light of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of our portfolio companies have already taken steps to significantly reduce, modify, or alter business strategies and operations, and we expect that additional portfolio companies may take similar steps if subjected to prolonged and severe financial distress, which may impair their business on a permanent basis. In addition, due to the completion of equity rounds by certain portfolio companies at lower valuations than rounds completed prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced unrealized depreciation on certain of our warrant and equity investments despite the relevant companies' ability to mitigate disruptions on their business strategies and operations. There can be no assurance that future equity rounds completed by our portfolio companies will be at levels greater than or equal to previous rounds, which may result in net unrealized depreciation on our warrant and equity portfolio in future periods.\nIn part due to these COVID-19-related developments, the fair value of certain of our portfolio investments as of December 31, 2020 and our expected recoveries for certain investments have decreased as compared to their fair value and expected recoveries as of December 31, 2019, and there may be further decreases in the fair values of our portfolio investments going forward. As of December 31, 2020, we had two portfolio companies in which our investments were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate cost and fair value of $61.8 million and $36.4 million, respectively. The various effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those discussed above, increase the risk that we will place additional investments on non-accrual status in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we are permitted under the 1940 Act, as a BDC, to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150% after such borrowing. In addition, the indenture governing the 2022 Notes contains certain covenants, including covenants (i) requiring our compliance with the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act (after giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC); and (ii) if our asset coverage has been below the 1940 Act minimum asset coverage requirements (after giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC) for more than six consecutive months, prohibiting the declaration of any cash dividend or distribution on our common stock (except to the extent necessary for us to maintain our treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code), or purchasing any of our common stock, unless, at the time of the declaration of the dividend or distribution or the purchase, and after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution, or purchase, we are in compliance with the 1940 Act asset coverage requirements (after giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC). The Credit Facility also includes certain covenants, including without limitation, a covenant requiring 150% asset coverage in accordance with the 1940 Act, and the Note Purchase Agreement governing the 2025 Notes contains certain covenants, including without limitation, a minimum asset coverage ratio of 150%, a minimum interest coverage ratio of 125%, and a minimum stockholders' equity threshold. Moreover, the fixed rate of the 2025 Notes is subject to a 1.00% increase in the event that a Below Investment Grade Event (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) occurs, which risk is increased as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 6. Borrowings\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the terms of the Credit Facility, the 2022 Notes, and the 2025 Notes.\nAs discussed below under Results of Operations,\u201d our net asset value per share as of December 31, 2020 decreased moderately as compared to our net asset value per share as of December 31, 2019. Any significant increase in aggregate unrealized depreciation of our investment portfolio or significant reductions in our net asset value as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise increases the risk of failing to meet the 1940 Act asset coverage requirements and breaching covenants under the Credit Facility, under the indenture governing the 2022 Notes, and under the Note Purchase Agreement governing the 2025 Notes, or otherwise triggering an event of default under the relevant borrowing arrangement. Any such breach of covenant or event of default, if we are not able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or debt holders, would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. See Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A for more information. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act, and we were not in breach of any covenants under the Credit Facility, under the indenture governing the 2022 Notes, or under the Note Purchase Agreement governing the 2025 Notes. We do not expect to breach any of these covenants in the near term assuming that conditions do not materially deteriorate further or for a prolonged period of time.\nWe will continue to monitor the evolving situation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related guidance from U.S. and international authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities. Given the dynamic nature of this situation and the fact that there may be developments outside of our control that require us or our portfolio companies to adjust plans of operation, we cannot reasonably estimate the full impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future. However, it could have a material adverse impact for a prolonged period of time on our future net investment income, particularly with respect to our interest income, the fair value of our portfolio investments, and the results of operations and financial condition of us and our portfolio companies. See Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A, and in our other filings with the SEC that we make from time to time, for more information.\nPortfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Asset Quality\nPortfolio Composition\nWe originate and invest primarily in venture growth stage companies. Companies at the venture growth stage have distinct characteristics differentiating them from venture capital-backed companies at other stages in their development lifecycle. We invest primarily in (i) growth capital loans that have a secured collateral position and that are generally used by venture growth stage companies to finance their continued expansion and growth, (ii) equipment financings, which may be structured as loans or leases, that have a secured collateral position on specified mission-critical equipment, (iii) on a select basis, revolving loans that have a secured collateral position and that are typically used by venture growth stage companies to advance against inventory, components, accounts receivable, contractual or future billings, bookings, revenues, sales or cash payments and collections including proceeds from a sale, financing or the equivalent and (iv) direct equity investments in venture growth stage companies. In connection with our growth capital loans, equipment financings and revolving loans, we generally receive warrant investments that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation of our borrowers and enhance our overall investment returns.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 195 investments in 69 companies. Our investments included 94 debt investments, 75 warrant investments, and 26 direct equity and related investments. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate cost and fair value of these investments were $662.4 million and $633.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, one of our portfolio companies was publicly traded. As of December 31, 2020, the 94 debt investments had an aggregate fair value of $583.3 million and a weighted average loan to enterprise value ratio at the time of underwriting of 8.9%. Enterprise value of a portfolio company is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of equity funding, at the time of origination.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 187 investments in 68 companies. Our investments included 102 debt investments, 64 warrant investments, and 21 direct equity and related investments. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate cost and fair value of these investments were $660.7 million and $653.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, two of our portfolio companies were publicly traded. As of December 31, 2019, the 102 debt investments had an aggregate fair value of $604.5 million and a weighted average loan to enterprise value ratio at the time of underwriting of 9.3%. Enterprise value of a portfolio company is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of equity funding, at the time of origination.\nThe

Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for us. We generally expect 50% - 75% of our gross unfunded commitments to eventually be drawn before the expiration of their corresponding availability periods.\nThe fair value at the inception of the delay draw credit agreements with our portfolio companies is equal to the fees and/or warrants received to enter into these agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit profile. The unfunded commitment liability reflects the fair value of these future funding commitments. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value for these unfunded commitments totaled $1.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively, and was included in other accrued expenses and liabilities\u201d in our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.\nOur level of investment activity can vary substantially from period to period as our Adviser chooses to slow or accelerate new business originations depending on market conditions, rate of investment of TPC's select group of leading venture capital investors, our Adviser's knowledge, expertise and experience, our funding capacity (including availability under the Credit Facility and our ability or inability to raise equity or debt capital), and other market dynamics.\nThe following table shows the debt commitments, fundings of debt investments (principal balance) and equity investments and non-binding term sheet activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments and Fundings\n(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Commitments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New portfolio companies </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>362,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Existing portfolio companies </td> <td> </td> <td>142,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145,419 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>276,681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>507,419 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funded Debt Investments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>204,626 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>418,093 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity Investments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,343 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Binding Term Sheets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>490,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>869,131 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> _______________\n(1)Includes backlog of potential future commitments.\nWe may enter into commitments with certain portfolio companies that permit an increase in the commitment amount in the future in the event that conditions to such increases are met ( backlog of potential future commitments\u201d). If such conditions to increase are met, these amounts may become unfunded commitments if not drawn prior to expiration. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, this backlog of potential future commitments totaled $20.8 million and $15.5 million, respectively.\nAsset Quality\nConsistent with TPC's existing policies, our Adviser maintains a credit watch list which places borrowers into five risk categories based on our Adviser's senior investment team's judgment, where 1 is the highest rating and all new loans are generally assigned a rating of 2.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Category </td> <td> </td> <td>Category Definition </td> <td> </td> <td>Action Item </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clear (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Performing above expectations and/or strong financial or enterprise profile, value or coverage. </td> <td> </td> <td>Review quarterly. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>White (2) </td> <td> </td> <td>Performing at expectations and/or reasonably close to it.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, portfolio company credit category changes, excluding fundings and repayments, consisted of the following: three portfolio companies with an aggregate principal balance of $24.7 million were upgraded from White (2) to Clear (1); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $10.4 million was upgraded from Orange (4) to Yellow (3); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $5.7 million was downgraded from Clear (1) to White (2); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $10.0 million was downgraded from White (2) to Yellow (3); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $20.0 million was downgraded from Yellow (3) to Orange (4); and two portfolio companies with an aggregate principal balance of $19.9 million were downgraded from Yellow (3) to Red (5).\nResults of Operations\nSet forth below is a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The comparison of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 can be found within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in Part II of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nComparison of operating results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nAn important measure of our financial performance is net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized gains (losses). Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses including interest on borrowed funds. Net realized gains (losses) on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net unrealized gains (losses) on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $35.3 million, which was comprised of $47.9 million of net investment income and $12.5 million of net realized and unrealized losses. On a per share basis for the year ended December 31, 2020, net investment income was $1.57 per share and the net increase in net assets from operations was $1.16 per share.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $31.8 million, which was comprised of $38.3 million of net investment income and $6.5 million of net realized and unrealized losses. On a per share basis for the year ended December 31, 2019, net investment income was $1.54 per share and the net increase in net assets from operations was $1.28 per share.\nInvestment Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total investment income was $91.2 million as compared to $73.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, is primarily due to higher weighted average principal outstanding on our income-bearing debt investment portfolio, partially offset by a lower effective yield due to lower prepayment activity and a decrease in the Prime Rate.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $2.6 million in other income consisting of $1.4 million from the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments, and $1.2 million from the realization of certain fees paid by portfolio companies and other income related to prepayment activity. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $2.9 million in other income consisting of $1.7 million from the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments, and $1.2 million from the realization of certain fees paid by portfolio companies and other income related to prepayment activity.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses consist of base management fee, income incentive fee, capital gains incentive fee, interest expense and amortization of fees, administration agreement expenses, and general and administrative expenses. In determining the base management fee, our Adviser has agreed to exclude U.S. Treasury bill assets acquired at the end of each applicable quarter from the calculation of the gross assets. We anticipate operating expenses will increase over time as our portfolio continues to grow. However, we anticipate operating expenses, as a percentage of totals assets and net assets, will generally decrease over time as our portfolio and capital base expand. We expect base management and income incentive fees will increase as we grow our asset base and our earnings. The capital gains incentive fee will depend on realized and unrealized gains and losses. Interest expenses will generally increase as we utilize more of the Credit Facility and issue additional debt securities, and we generally expect expenses under the administration agreement and general and administrative expenses to increase over time to meet the additional requirements associated with servicing a larger portfolio.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total operating expenses were $43.3 million as compared to $35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nBase management fees totaled $12.4 million and $8.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Base management fees for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019, increased primarily due to an increase in the average size of our portfolio between periods.\nIncome incentive fees totaled $8.7 million and $8.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our income incentive fee was reduced by $2.6 million due to the total return requirement under the income component of our incentive fee structure, which resulted in a corresponding increase of $2.6 million in net investment income. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our income incentive fee was reduced by $1.2 million due to the total return requirement under the income component of our incentive fee structure, which resulted in a corresponding increase of approximately $1.2 million in net investment income.\nThere was no capital gains incentive fee expense calculated for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest and fees on our borrowings totaled $15.5 million and $12.4 million, respectively. Interest and fee expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019, increased due to the issuance of the 2025 Notes, as well as a higher weighted-average outstanding principal balance on our Credit Facility, partially offset by a decrease in interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nAdministration agreement and general and administrative expenses totaled $6.7 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019, was primarily due to increased use of professional services and a higher overhead allocation between the periods, partially offset by lower third-party expenses as a result of internalization of third-party services by the Administrator.\nNet Realized Gains and Losses and Net Unrealized Gains and Losses\nRealized gains and losses are included in net realized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized net realized gains of $8.6 million from the sale of investments, consisting of $28.8 million of realized gains from the sale of publicly traded shares held in CrowdStrike, Inc. and Medallia, Inc., and $0.8 million of realized gains from the sale of warrants in Freshly Inc., offset by $20.1 million of realized losses from the finalization of asset sales and removal from our investment portfolio of three obligors, Cambridge Broadband Network Limited, Harvest Power, Inc., and Munchery, Inc., which were rated Red (5) on our credit watch list, and $0.9 million of other net realized losses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized net realized losses from the sale of investments of $0.6 million, primarily as a result of the write-off of investments in one portfolio company, partially offset by a realized gain from the sale of an equity investment.\nUnrealized gains and losses are included in net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\nNet change in unrealized losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $21.1 million, resulting primarily from the reversal and recognition of $14.3 million of previously recorded unrealized gains associated with the shares of CrowdStrike, Inc. and Medallia, Inc. that we sold during the year, as well as net unrealized losses on our investment portfolio during the year resulting from fair value adjustments, partially offset by the reversal and recognition of $19.4 million of previously recorded unrealized losses associated with three obligors rated Red (5) on our credit watch list.\nNet change in unrealized losses during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $5.9 million, which primarily consisted of the reversal and recognition of previously recorded net unrealized gains of $1.9 million into income or realized gains, and $4.0 million of net unrealized losses on our investment portfolio related to mark to market activity.\nNet change in realized and unrealized gains or losses in subsequent periods may be volatile as such results depend on changes in the market, changes in the underlying performance of our portfolio companies and their respective industries, and other market factors.\nPortfolio Yield and Total Return\nInvestment income includes interest income on our debt investments utilizing the effective yield method including cash interest income as well as the amortization of any purchase premium, accretion of purchase discount, original issue discount, facilities fees, and the amortization and payment of the end-of-term ( EOT\u201d) payments. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest income totaled $88.6 million and $70.5 million, respectively, representing a weighted average annualized portfolio yield on total debt investments for the period held of 13.8% and 15.0%, respectively.\nWe calculate weighted average annualized portfolio yields for periods shown as the annualized rates of the interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio during the period. The weighted average yields reported for these periods are annualized and reflect the weighted average yields to maturities. Should the portfolio companies choose to repay their loans earlier, our weighted average yields will increase for those debt investments affected but may reduce our weighted average yields on the remaining portfolio in future quarters.\nThe yield on our total debt portfolio, excluding the impact of prepayments, was 12.5% and 13.1% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following table shows the weighted average annualized portfolio yield on our total debt portfolio comprising of cash interest income, accretion of the net purchase discount, facilities fees and the value of warrant investments received, accretion of EOT payments and the accelerated receipt of EOT payments on prepayments:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratios\n(Percentages, on an annualized basis)(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average annualized portfolio yield on total debt investments(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>13.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coupon income </td> <td> </td> <td>9.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accretion of discount </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accretion of end-of-term payments </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of prepayments during the period </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime Rate at end of period(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>3.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.75 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> _____________\n(1)The yields for periods shown are the annualized rates of interest income or the components of interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio during the period.\n(2)The weighted average portfolio yields on total debt investments reflected above do not represent actual investment returns to our stockholders.\n(3)Included as a reference point for coupon income and weighted average portfolio yield.\nOur weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments may be higher than an investor's yield on an investment in shares of our common stock. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments does not reflect operating expenses that may be incurred by us and, thus, by our stockholders. In addition, our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures do not represent actual investment returns to stockholders. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures are subject to change and, in the future, may be greater or less than the rates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Total return based on NAV is the change in ending NAV per share plus distributions per share paid during the period assuming participation in our dividend reinvestment plan divided by the beginning NAV per share for such period. Total return based on stock price is the change in the ending stock price of our common stock plus distributions paid during the period assuming participation in our dividend reinvestment plan divided by the beginning stock price of our common stock for such period. The total return is for the period shown and is not annualized.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our total return during the period based on the change in NAV plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was 14.2% and our total return during the period based on the change in stock price plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was 7.7%. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our total return during the period based on the change in NAV plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was 9.5% and our total return during the period based on the change in stock price plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was 44.7%.\nThe table below shows our return on average total assets and return on average NAV for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Returns on Net Asset Value and Total Assets\n(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,253 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in net assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,758 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average net asset value(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>408,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>343,919 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average total assets(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>706,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>542,497 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income to average net asset value </td> <td> </td> <td>11.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in net assets to average net asset value </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income to average total assets </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in net assets to average total assets </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> _______________\n(1)The average net asset values and the average total assets are computed based on daily balances.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ.\nUnderstanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. We consider valuation of investments and unrealized gains or losses to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nThese critical accounting policies and estimates, and any changes thereto, are discussed under Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 4. Investments\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSet forth below is a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. A discussion of our liquidity and capital resources as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 can be found within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in Part II of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand, our available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations, including from contractual monthly portfolio company payments and cash flows, prepayments, and the ability to liquidate publicly traded investments, will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations. This Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section should be read in conjunction with COVID-19 Developments\u201d above and Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCash Flows\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities, consisting primarily of purchases, sales and repayments of investments and the items described in Results of Operations,\u201d was $60.6 million, and net cash used in financing activities was $42.3 million due to net repayments under the Credit Facility of $144.3 million, $42.5 million in distributions paid, and $2.8 million of deferred Credit Facility costs, partially offset by net proceeds received from our January 2020 public follow-on offering of common stock and the issuance of the 2025 Notes in March 2020. As of December 31, 2020, cash, including restricted cash, was $44.7 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used by operating activities, consisting primarily of purchases, sales and repayments of investments and the items described in Results of Operations,\u201d was $187.5 million and net cash provided by financing activities was $204.0 million due to net borrowings under the Credit Facility of $239.3 million, $33.8 million in distributions paid, and $1.5 million of deferred credit facility costs. As of December 31, 2019, cash, including restricted cash, was $26.4 million.\nCapital Resources and Borrowings\nAs a BDC, we generally have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. As a result, we expect, from time to time, to access the debt and equity markets when we believe it is necessary and appropriate to do so. In this regard, we continue to explore various options for obtaining additional debt or equity capital for investments. This may include expanding or extending the Credit Facility or the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or debt securities. If we are unable to obtain leverage or raise equity capital on terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to grow our portfolio could be substantially impacted.\nCredit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $325 million in total commitments available under the Credit Facility (see Recent Developments\u201d below for information regarding the increase in commitments under the Credit Facility subsequent to year-end), subject to various covenants and borrowing base requirements. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature, which allows us to increase the size of the Credit Facility to up to $400 million under certain circumstances. The revolving period under the Credit Facility expires on November 30, 2022, and the maturity date of the Credit Facility is May 31, 2024 (unless otherwise terminated earlier pursuant to its terms). Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the sum of (i) a floating rate based on certain indices, including LIBOR and commercial paper rates (subject to a floor of 0.50%), plus (ii) a margin of 2.80% if facility utilization is greater than or equal to 75%, 2.90% if utilization is greater than or equal to 50%, 3.00% if utilization is less than 50% and 4.5% during the amortization period. See Note 6. Borrowings\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the terms of the Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had outstanding borrowings of $118.0 million and $262.3 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility, excluding deferred credit facility costs of $3.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively, which is included in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. We had $207.0 million and $37.7 million of remaining capacity on our Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n2022 Notes\nOn July 14, 2017, we completed a public offering of $65.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes and received net proceeds of $62.8 million, after the payment of fees and offering costs. On July 24, 2017, as a result of the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional 2022 Notes, we issued an additional $9.75 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes and received net proceeds of $9.5 million, after the payment of fees and offering costs. The interest on the 2022 Notes, which accrues at an annual rate of 5.75%, is payable quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15. The maturity date of the 2022 Notes is July 15, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have recorded in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities our liability for the 2022 Notes, net of deferred issuance costs, of $74.0 million and $73.5 million, respectively. See Note 6. Borrowings\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the 2022 Notes.\n2025 Notes\nOn March 19, 2020, we completed a private offering of $70.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes and received net proceeds of $69.1 million, after the payment of fees and offering costs. The interest on the 2025 Notes, which accrues at an annual rate of 4.50%, is payable semiannually on March 19 and September 19 each year, beginning on September 19, 2020. The maturity date of the 2025 Notes is March 19, 2025.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have recorded in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities our liability for the 2025 Notes, net of deferred issuance costs, of $69.1 million. See Note 6. Borrowings\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the 2025 Notes.\nAdviser Revolver\nOn May 6, 2020, we entered into an unsecured revolving loan agreement (the Adviser Revolver\u201d) with the Adviser, which had a maximum credit limit of $50.0 million. The Adviser Revolver expired on December 31, 2020 without us having drawn or otherwise borrowed any amounts thereunder.\nAsset Coverage Requirements\nOn June 21, 2018, our stockholders voted at a special meeting of stockholders to approve a proposal to authorize us to be subject to a reduced asset coverage ratio of at least 150% under the 1940 Act. As a result of the stockholder approval at the special meeting, effective June 22, 2018, our applicable minimum asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act has been decreased to 150% from 200%. Thus, we are permitted under the 1940 Act, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. As of December 31, 2020, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 252%.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table shows a summary of our payment obligations for repayment of debt as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments Due By Period\n(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>74,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025 Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>70,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>262,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>188,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSenior Securities\nInformation about our senior securities is shown in the following table as of each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Refer to Investment Activity\u201d above.\nDistributions\nWe have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. To obtain and maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute at least 90% of our net ordinary income and net realized short-term capital gains in excess of our net realized long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders. In order to avoid a non-deductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on certain of our undistributed income, we would need to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: (a) 98% of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for such calendar year; (b) 98.2% of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made by us to use our taxable year); and (c) certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. For the tax years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we were subject to a 4% U.S. federal excise tax and we may be subject to this tax in future years. In such cases, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.\nTo the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for the year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders. Our Adviser monitors available taxable earnings, including net investment income and realized capital gains, to determine if a return of capital may occur for the year. We estimate the source of our distributions as required by Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act to determine whether payment of dividends are expected to be paid from any other source other than net investment income accrued for current period or certain cumulative periods, but we will not be able to determine whether any specific distribution will be treated as made out of our taxable earnings or as a return of capital until after the end of our taxable year. Any amount treated as a return of capital will reduce a stockholder's adjusted tax basis in his or her common stock, thereby increasing his or her potential gain or reducing his or her potential loss on the subsequent sale or other disposition of his or her common stock. On a quarterly basis, for any payment of dividends estimated to be paid from any other source other than net investment income accrued for current period or certain cumulative periods based on the Section 19(a) requirement, we post a Section 19(a) notice through the Depository Trust Company's Legal Notice System and our website, as well as send our registered stockholders a printed copy of such notice along with the dividend payment. The estimates of the source of the distribution are interim estimates based on GAAP that are subject to revision, and the exact character of the distributions for tax purposes cannot be determined until the final books and records are finalized for the calendar year. Therefore, these estimates are made solely in order to comply with the requirements of Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act and should not be relied upon for tax reporting or any other purposes and could differ significantly from the actual character of distributions for tax purposes.\nThe following table shows our cash distributions per share that have been authorized by our Board since our initial public offering to December 31, 2020. From March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2015, and during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, distributions represent ordinary income as our earnings exceeded distributions. Approximately $0.24 per share of the distributions during the year ended December 31, 2016 represented a return of capital. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, distributions represent ordinary income and long term capital gains. Depending on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent of its impact on our portfolio companies' operations and our net investment income, any future distributions to our stockholders may be for amounts less than our historical distributions, may be made less frequently than historical practices, and may be made in part cash and part stock (as per each stockholder's election), subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

2019, distributions paid were comprised of interest-sourced distributions (qualified interest income) in amounts equal to 93.5% and 98.8% of total distributions paid, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we estimated that we had undistributed taxable earnings from net investment income and realized gains (or Spillover Income\u201d) of $16.2 million, or $0.53 per share.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement\u201d, which is intended to improve the effectiveness of fair value measurement disclosures. The amendment, among other things, affects certain disclosure requirements related to transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and Level 3 fair value measurements as they relate to valuation process, unrealized gains and losses, measurement uncertainty, and significant unobservable inputs. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of these rules did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference rate reform (Topic 848)-Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting.\u201d The amendments in this update provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to certain contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform and became effective upon issuance for all entities. The standard is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The adoption of these rules did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Developments\nDistribution\nOn February 24, 2021, the Board declared a $0.36 per share regular quarterly distribution, payable on March 31, 2021 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2021.\nRecent Portfolio Activity\nFrom January 1, 2021 through March 2, 2021, we closed $48.4 million of additional debt commitments and funded $42.9 million in new investments. TPC's direct originations platform entered into $58.1 million of additional non-binding signed term sheets with venture growth stage companies. These investment opportunities for us are subject to due diligence, definitive documentation and investment committee approval, as well as compliance with TPC's allocation policy. From January 1, 2021 through March 2, 2021, we received $17.4 million of principal prepayments generating approximately $0.5 million of accelerated income.\nOn January 11, 2021, we sold our investments in portfolio company Knotel, Inc. ( Knotel\u201d) to a third party for gross proceeds of approximately $15.0 million plus potential equity in its post-bankruptcy entity. On January 31, 2021, Knotel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The fair value of our investments in Knotel as of December 31, 2020 was $15.0 million, reflecting cash proceeds received in January 2021.\nAmendment to the Credit Facility\nOn January 29, 2021, we amended the Credit Facility to increase the capacity of the Credit Facility to $350 million from $325 million and add a new lender. The $25 million increase in the capacity of the Credit Facility was made under the accordion feature in the Credit Facility.\nIssuance of 4.50% Series 2021A Senior Notes Due 2026\nOn March 1, 2021, we issued $200,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of our 4.50% Series 2021A Senior Notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes\u201d). The 2026 Notes were issued in a private placement to certain qualified institutional investors, pursuant to the terms of the First Supplement, dated as of March 1, 2021 (the First Supplement\u201d), to the Note Purchase Agreement. The 2026 Notes bear a fixed interest rate of 4.50% per year and will mature on March 1, 2026, unless redeemed, purchased or prepaid by us prior to such date in accordance with their terms. In the event that a Below Investment Grade Event (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) occurs, the 2026 Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% per year from the date of the occurrence of the Below Investment Grade Event to and until the date on which the Below Investment Grade Event is no longer continuing.\nInterest on the 2026 Notes will be due semiannually on March 19 and September 19 each year, beginning on September 19, 2021. The 2026 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option at par plus accrued interest to the prepayment date and, if applicable, a make-whole premium. In addition, we are obligated to offer to prepay the 2026 Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the date of prepayment, if certain change in control events occur. The 2026 Notes are our general unsecured obligations that rank pari passu with all outstanding and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness issued by us; provided, however, in the event that we create, incur, assume or permit to exist liens on or with respect to any of our property or assets in connection with future secured indebtedness of more than an aggregate principal amount of $25 million, the 2026 Notes and the 2025 Notes will generally become secured concurrently therewith, equally and ratably with such indebtedness. The other terms and conditions applicable to the 2026 Notes under the Note\nPurchase Agreement, as modified by the First Supplement, including events of default and affirmative and negative covenants, are substantially similar to the terms and conditions applicable to the 2025 Notes.\nThe 2026 Notes were offered in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of Securities Act. The 2026 Notes have not and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act, as applicable.", "item_7_truncated": "For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest and fees on our borrowings totaled $15.5 million and $12.4 million, respectively. Interest and fee expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019, increased due to the issuance of the 2025 Notes, as well as a higher weighted-average outstanding principal balance on our Credit Facility, partially offset by a decrease in interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nThe following table shows the total portfolio investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\nThe yield on our total debt portfolio, excluding the impact of prepayments, was 12.5% and 13.1% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n _____________\n\u2022our expected financings and investments;\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Category </td> <td> </td> <td>Category Definition </td> <td> </td> <td>Action Item </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clear (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Performing above expectations and/or strong financial or enterprise profile, value or coverage. </td> <td> </td> <td>Review quarterly. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>White (2) </td> <td> </td> <td>Performing at expectations and/or reasonably close to it.

In addition, as a result of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related disruption and financial distress, certain portfolio companies may seek to modify their loans from us, which could reduce the amount or extend the time for payment of principal, reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest, and/or increase the amount of PIK interest we receive with respect to such investment, among other things. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have also impeded, and may continue to impede, the ability of certain of our portfolio companies to raise additional capital and/or pursue asset sales or otherwise execute strategic transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on the valuation of our investments in such companies. Portfolio companies operating in certain industries may be more susceptible to these risks than other portfolio companies in other industries in light of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of our portfolio companies have already taken steps to significantly reduce, modify, or alter business strategies and operations, and we expect that additional portfolio companies may take similar steps if subjected to prolonged and severe financial distress, which may impair their business on a permanent basis. In addition, due to the completion of equity rounds by certain portfolio companies at lower valuations than rounds completed prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced unrealized depreciation on certain of our warrant and equity investments despite the relevant companies' ability to mitigate disruptions on their business strategies and operations. There can be no assurance that future equity rounds completed by our portfolio companies will be at levels greater than or equal to previous rounds, which may result in net unrealized depreciation on our warrant and equity portfolio in future periods.\nAs a BDC, we generally have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. As a result, we expect, from time to time, to access the debt and equity markets when we believe it is necessary and appropriate to do so. In this regard, we continue to explore various options for obtaining additional debt or equity capital for investments. This may include expanding or extending the Credit Facility or the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or debt securities. If we are unable to obtain leverage or raise equity capital on terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to grow our portfolio could be substantially impacted.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have recorded in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities our liability for the 2022 Notes, net of deferred issuance costs, of $74.0 million and $73.5 million, respectively.

The increase for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019, was primarily due to increased use of professional services and a higher overhead allocation between the periods, partially offset by lower third-party expenses as a result of internalization of third-party services by the Administrator.\nCredit Facility\n\u2022the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A, and in our other filings with the SEC that we make from time to time.\n(1)Total amount of senior securities outstanding at the end of the period presented (in thousands).\nInformation about our senior securities is shown in the following table as of each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The report of Deloitte & Touche, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, on the Senior Securities table as of December 31, 2020, is attached as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCash Flows\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total operating expenses were $43.3 million as compared to $35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe following table shows the debt commitments, fundings of debt investments (principal balance) and equity investments and non-binding term sheet activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nWe calculate weighted average annualized portfolio yields for periods shown as the annualized rates of the interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio during the period. The weighted average yields reported for these periods are annualized and reflect the weighted average yields to maturities. Should the portfolio companies choose to repay their loans earlier, our weighted average yields will increase for those debt investments affected but may reduce our weighted average yields on the remaining portfolio in future quarters.\n\u2022the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies.\nAn important measure of our financial performance is net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized gains (losses). Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses including interest on borrowed funds. Net realized gains (losses) on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net unrealized gains (losses) on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio.\n _______________\n(1)Represents non-duplicative number of companies.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 187 investments in 68 companies. Our investments included 102 debt investments, 64 warrant investments, and 21 direct equity and related investments. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate cost and fair value of these investments were $660.7 million and $653.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, two of our portfolio companies were publicly traded. As of December 31, 2019, the 102 debt investments had an aggregate fair value of $604.5 million and a weighted average loan to enterprise value ratio at the time of underwriting of 9.3%. Enterprise value of a portfolio company is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of equity funding, at the time of origination.\nWe originate and invest primarily in venture growth stage companies. Companies at the venture growth stage have distinct characteristics differentiating them from venture capital-backed companies at other stages in their development lifecycle. We invest primarily in (i) growth capital loans that have a secured collateral position and that are generally used by venture growth stage companies to finance their continued expansion and growth, (ii) equipment financings, which may be structured as loans or leases, that have a secured collateral position on specified mission-critical equipment, (iii) on a select basis, revolving loans that have a secured collateral position and that are typically used by venture growth stage companies to advance against inventory, components, accounts receivable, contractual or future billings, bookings, revenues, sales or cash payments and collections including proceeds from a sale, financing or the equivalent and (iv) direct equity investments in venture growth stage companies. In connection with our growth capital loans, equipment financings and revolving loans, we generally receive warrant investments that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation of our borrowers and enhance our overall investment returns.\n2022 Notes\n\u2022the performance of our existing portfolio and other investments we may make in the future;\n\u2022our ability to qualify and maintain our qualification as a RIC and as a BDC;\nTotal operating expenses consist of base management fee, income incentive fee, capital gains incentive fee, interest expense and amortization of fees, administration agreement expenses, and general and administrative expenses. In determining the base management fee, our Adviser has agreed to exclude U.S. Treasury bill assets acquired at the end of each applicable quarter from the calculation of the gross assets. We anticipate operating expenses will increase over time as our portfolio continues to grow. However, we anticipate operating expenses, as a percentage of totals assets and net assets, will generally decrease over time as our portfolio and capital base expand. We expect base management and income incentive fees will increase as we grow our asset base and our earnings. The capital gains incentive fee will depend on realized and unrealized gains and losses. Interest expenses will generally increase as we utilize more of the Credit Facility and issue additional debt securities, and we generally expect expenses under the administration agreement and general and administrative expenses to increase over time to meet the additional requirements associated with servicing a larger portfolio.\nThese statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation:\nThese critical accounting policies and estimates, and any changes thereto, are discussed under Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 4. Investments\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn January 11, 2021, we sold our investments in portfolio company Knotel, Inc. ( Knotel\u201d) to a third party for gross proceeds of approximately $15.0 million plus potential equity in its post-bankruptcy entity. On January 31, 2021, Knotel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The fair value of our investments in Knotel as of December 31, 2020 was $15.0 million, reflecting cash proceeds received in January 2021.\n_______________\nPortfolio Composition\nDistribution\n\nWhile we have been monitoring, and continue to monitor, the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our and our portfolio companies' business, we have continued to raise capital, maintain appropriate levels of available liquidity, support and monitor our existing portfolio companies, fund existing unfunded commitments, and selectively deploy capital in new investment opportunities in venture growth stage companies. As a result of our focus on maintaining adequate liquidity amid current market uncertainty, our interest expense has increased from comparable prior year periods due to maintaining a higher weighted average outstanding principal balance on borrowings and increased cash reserves.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used by operating activities, consisting primarily of purchases, sales and repayments of investments and the items described in Results of Operations,\u201d was $187.5 million and net cash provided by financing activities was $204.0 million due to net borrowings under the Credit Facility of $239.3 million, $33.8 million in distributions paid, and $1.5 million of deferred credit facility costs. As of December 31, 2019, cash, including restricted cash, was $26.4 million.\nCapital Resources and Borrowings\n(1)Debt balance is net of fees and discounts applied to the loan at origination.\nInvestment income includes interest income on our debt investments utilizing the effective yield method including cash interest income as well as the amortization of any purchase premium, accretion of purchase discount, original issue discount, facilities fees, and the amortization and payment of the end-of-term ( EOT\u201d) payments. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest income totaled $88.6 million and $70.5 million, respectively, representing a weighted average annualized portfolio yield on total debt investments for the period held of 13.8% and 15.0%, respectively.\nForward-Looking Statements\n(2)Represents a special distribution.\nAmendment to the Credit Facility\nComparison of operating results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nOn March 1, 2021, we issued $200,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of our 4.50% Series 2021A Senior Notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes\u201d). The 2026 Notes were issued in a private placement to certain qualified institutional investors, pursuant to the terms of the First Supplement, dated as of March 1, 2021 (the First Supplement\u201d), to the Note Purchase Agreement. The 2026 Notes bear a fixed interest rate of 4.50% per year and will mature on March 1, 2026, unless redeemed, purchased or prepaid by us prior to such date in accordance with their terms. In the event that a Below Investment Grade Event (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) occurs, the 2026 Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% per year from the date of the occurrence of the Below Investment Grade Event to and until the date on which the Below Investment Grade Event is no longer continuing.\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and schedules thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as otherwise specified, references to the Company\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d, and our\u201d refer to TriplePoint Venture Growth BDC Corp. and its subsidiaries.\nOn May 6, 2020, we entered into an unsecured revolving loan agreement (the Adviser Revolver\u201d) with the Adviser, which had a maximum credit limit of $50.0 million. The Adviser Revolver expired on December 31, 2020 without us having drawn or otherwise borrowed any amounts thereunder.\nAsset Quality\n _____________\nPortfolio Yield and Total Return\nWe may enter into commitments with certain portfolio companies that permit an increase in the commitment amount in the future in the event that conditions to such increases are met ( backlog of potential future commitments\u201d). If such conditions to increase are met, these amounts may become unfunded commitments if not drawn prior to expiration. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, this backlog of potential future commitments totaled $20.8 million and $15.5 million, respectively.\nWe were formed to expand the venture growth stage business segment of TPC's investment platform. TPC is widely recognized as a leading global financing provider devoted to serving venture capital-backed companies with creative, flexible and customized debt financing, equity capital and complementary services throughout their lifespan. TPC is located on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley and has a primary focus in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries.\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations, changes in political, economic or industry conditions, and changes in the interest rate environment or other conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, including with respect to changes resulting from or in response to, or potentially even the absence of changes as a result of, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\nIn part due to these COVID-19-related developments, the fair value of certain of our portfolio investments as of December 31, 2020 and our expected recoveries for certain investments have decreased as compared to their fair value and expected recoveries as of December 31, 2019, and there may be further decreases in the fair values of our portfolio investments going forward. As of December 31, 2020, we had two portfolio companies in which our investments were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate cost and fair value of $61.8 million and $36.4 million, respectively. The various effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those discussed above, increase the risk that we will place additional investments on non-accrual status in the future.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we entered into commitments with 18 new portfolio companies and 11 existing portfolio companies totaling $507.4 million, funded 72 debt investments for $418.1 million in principal value, acquired warrant investments representing $6.6 million of value, made equity investments of $3.3 million and sold equity in one portfolio company for $1.4 million.\n _______________\nAs of December 31, 2019, the weighted average investment ranking of our debt investment portfolio was 1.94. During the year ended December 31, 2019, portfolio company credit category changes, excluding fundings and repayments, consisted of the following: three portfolio companies with an aggregate principal balance of $24.7 million were upgraded from White (2) to Clear (1); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $10.4 million was upgraded from Orange (4) to Yellow (3); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $5.7 million was downgraded from Clear (1) to White (2); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $10.0 million was downgraded from White (2) to Yellow (3); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $20.0 million was downgraded from Yellow (3) to Orange (4); and two portfolio companies with an aggregate principal balance of $19.9 million were downgraded from Yellow (3) to Red (5).\n(1)Represents non-duplicative number of companies.\n\nGrowth capital loans in which the borrower held a term loan facility, with or without an accompanying revolving loan, in priority to our senior lien represent 30.6% and 31.0% of our debt investments at fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(1)The yields for periods shown are the annualized rates of interest income or the components of interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio during the period.\n*Amount represents less than 0.05% of the total portfolio investments.\n\u2022our relationships with third parties, including but not limited to lenders and venture capital investors, including other investors in our portfolio companies;\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total investment income was $91.2 million as compared to $73.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, is primarily due to higher weighted average principal outstanding on our income-bearing debt investment portfolio, partially offset by a lower effective yield due to lower prepayment activity and a decrease in the Prime Rate.\nNet change in unrealized losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $21.1 million, resulting primarily from the reversal and recognition of $14.3 million of previously recorded unrealized gains associated with the shares of CrowdStrike, Inc. and Medallia, Inc. that we sold during the year, as well as net unrealized losses on our investment portfolio during the year resulting from fair value adjustments, partially offset by the reversal and recognition of $19.4 million of previously recorded unrealized losses associated with three obligors rated Red (5) on our credit watch list.\n\nRealized gains and losses are included in net realized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\n2025 Notes\n\u2022an economic downturn and the time period required for robust economic recovery therefrom, including the current economic downturn as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already generally had a material impact on our portfolio companies' results of operations and financial condition and will likely continue to have a material impact on our portfolio companies' results of operations and financial condition, for its duration, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition;\nSet forth below is a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. A discussion of our liquidity and capital resources as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 can be found within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in Part II of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nOn March 19, 2020, we completed a private offering of $70.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes and received net proceeds of $69.1 million, after the payment of fees and offering costs. The interest on the 2025 Notes, which accrues at an annual rate of 4.50%, is payable semiannually on March 19 and September 19 each year, beginning on September 19, 2020. The maturity date of the 2025 Notes is March 19, 2025.\nThe following table shows our unfunded commitments by portfolio company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nInvestment Income\n\u2022the adequacy of our available liquidity, cash resources and working capital and compliance with covenants under our borrowing arrangements; and\nContractual Obligations\nIssuance of 4.50% Series 2021A Senior Notes Due 2026\nNet change in realized and unrealized gains or losses in subsequent periods may be volatile as such results depend on changes in the market, changes in the underlying performance of our portfolio companies and their respective industries, and other market factors.\nAdviser Revolver\nThe 2026 Notes were offered in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of Securities Act. The 2026 Notes have not and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act, as applicable.\nThe table below shows our return on average total assets and return on average NAV for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\u2022actual and potential conflicts of interest with TPC, the Adviser and its senior investment team and Investment Committee;\nThe following table shows the financing product type of our debt investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nFrom January 1, 2021 through March 2, 2021, we closed $48.4 million of additional debt commitments and funded $42.9 million in new investments. TPC's direct originations platform entered into $58.1 million of additional non-binding signed term sheets with venture growth stage companies. These investment opportunities for us are subject to due diligence, definitive documentation and investment committee approval, as well as compliance with TPC's allocation policy. From January 1, 2021 through March 2, 2021, we received $17.4 million of principal prepayments generating approximately $0.5 million of accelerated income.\n\u2022currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. dollars;\nThe fair value at the inception of the delay draw credit agreements with our portfolio companies is equal to the fees and/or warrants received to enter into these agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit profile. The unfunded commitment liability reflects the fair value of these future funding commitments. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value for these unfunded commitments totaled $1.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively, and was included in other accrued expenses and liabilities\u201d in our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nRecent Developments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we received $164.1 million of debt prepayments and $37.5 million of scheduled amortization and repayments.\n\u2022the expected market for venture capital investments;\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $35.3 million, which was comprised of $47.9 million of net investment income and $12.5 million of net realized and unrealized losses. On a per share basis for the year ended December 31, 2020, net investment income was $1.57 per share and the net increase in net assets from operations was $1.16 per share.\nSenior Securities\nCOVID-19 Developments\nOn February 24, 2021, the Board declared a $0.36 per share regular quarterly distribution, payable on March 31, 2021 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2021.\nThe following table shows additional information on our unfunded commitments regarding milestones, expirations, and types of loans as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\u2022risks associated with possible disruption in our or our portfolio companies' operations due to wars and other forms of conflict, terrorist acts, security operations and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and global health epidemics; and\n\u2022interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly given that we use leverage as part of our investment strategy;\n _______________\nThe following table shows the weighted average annualized portfolio yield on our total debt portfolio comprising of cash interest income, accretion of the net purchase discount, facilities fees and the value of warrant investments received, accretion of EOT payments and the accelerated receipt of EOT payments on prepayments:\nBase management fees totaled $12.4 million and $8.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Base management fees for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019, increased primarily due to an increase in the average size of our portfolio between periods.\n\u2022the ability of our Adviser to attract, retain and have access to highly talented professionals, including our Adviser's senior management team;\nRecent Portfolio Activity\nAsset Coverage Requirements\nAlthough we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include, without limitation, our ability to originate new loans and investments, borrowing costs and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following tables show information on the cost and fair value of our investments in companies along with the number of companies in our portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we received $138.1 million of principal prepayments, $17.0 million of early repayments, and $48.3 million of scheduled principal amortization.\n _______________\nThe following table shows our cash distributions per share that have been authorized by our Board since our initial public offering to December 31, 2020. From March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2015, and during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, distributions represent ordinary income as our earnings exceeded distributions. Approximately $0.24 per share of the distributions during the year ended December 31, 2016 represented a return of capital. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, distributions represent ordinary income and long term capital gains. Depending on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent of its impact on our portfolio companies' operations and our net investment income, any future distributions to our stockholders may be for amounts less than our historical distributions, may be made less frequently than historical practices, and may be made in part cash and part stock (as per each stockholder's election), subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution.\nIncome incentive fees totaled $8.7 million and $8.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our income incentive fee was reduced by $2.6 million due to the total return requirement under the income component of our incentive fee structure, which resulted in a corresponding increase of $2.6 million in net investment income. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our income incentive fee was reduced by $1.2 million due to the total return requirement under the income component of our incentive fee structure, which resulted in a corresponding increase of approximately $1.2 million in net investment income.\n _______________\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d plans,\u201d will,\u201d may,\u201d continue,\u201d believes,\u201d seeks,\u201d estimates,\u201d would,\u201d could,\u201d should,\u201d targets,\u201d projects,\u201d and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include statements as to:\n\u2022our and our portfolio companies' future operating results and financial condition, including the ability of us and our portfolio companies to achieve our respective objectives;\n(1)The average net asset values and the average total assets are computed based on daily balances.\nWe will continue to monitor the evolving situation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related guidance from U.S. and international authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities. Given the dynamic nature of this situation and the fact that there may be developments outside of our control that require us or our portfolio companies to adjust plans of operation, we cannot reasonably estimate the full impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future. However, it could have a material adverse impact for a prolonged period of time on our future net investment income, particularly with respect to our interest income, the fair value of our portfolio investments, and the results of operations and financial condition of us and our portfolio companies. See Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A, and in our other filings with the SEC that we make from time to time, for more information.\n(2)Asset coverage per unit is the ratio of the carrying value of our total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, in relation to the aggregate amount of senior securities representing indebtedness. Asset coverage per unit is expressed in terms of dollar amounts per $1,000 of indebtedness.\nOur credit agreements contain customary lending provisions that allow us relief from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying company experiences material adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the company. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for us. We generally expect 50% - 75% of our gross unfunded commitments to eventually be drawn before the expiration of their corresponding availability periods.\nWe have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. To obtain and maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute at least 90% of our net ordinary income and net realized short-term capital gains in excess of our net realized long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders. In order to avoid a non-deductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on certain of our undistributed income, we would need to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: (a) 98% of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for such calendar year; (b) 98.2% of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made by us to use our taxable year); and (c) certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. For the tax years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we were subject to a 4% U.S. federal excise tax and we may be subject to this tax in future years. In such cases, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.\n\u2022the impact and timing of our unfunded commitments;\n_____________\nUnrealized gains and losses are included in net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPortfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Asset Quality\n\u2022a contraction of available credit, an inability or unwillingness of our lenders to fund their commitments to us and/or an inability to access capital markets or additional sources of liquidity, including as a result of the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and impair our lending and investment activities;\nAs of December 31, 2019, our unfunded commitments to 15 companies totaled $226.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $167.1 million in unfunded commitments expired or were terminated.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference rate reform (Topic 848)-Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting.\u201d The amendments in this update provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to certain contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform and became effective upon issuance for all entities. The standard is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The adoption of these rules did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following tables show the fair value of the portfolio of investments, by industry and the percentage of the total investment portfolio, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\n _______________\nPurchase Agreement, as modified by the First Supplement, including events of default and affirmative and negative covenants, are substantially similar to the terms and conditions applicable to the 2025 Notes.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we are permitted under the 1940 Act, as a BDC, to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150% after such borrowing. In addition, the indenture governing the 2022 Notes contains certain covenants, including covenants (i) requiring our compliance with the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act (after giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC); and (ii) if our asset coverage has been below the 1940 Act minimum asset coverage requirements (after giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC) for more than six consecutive months, prohibiting the declaration of any cash dividend or distribution on our common stock (except to the extent necessary for us to maintain our treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code), or purchasing any of our common stock, unless, at the time of the declaration of the dividend or distribution or the purchase, and after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution, or purchase, we are in compliance with the 1940 Act asset coverage requirements (after giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC). The Credit Facility also includes certain covenants, including without limitation, a covenant requiring 150% asset coverage in accordance with the 1940 Act, and the Note Purchase Agreement governing the 2025 Notes contains certain covenants, including without limitation, a minimum asset coverage ratio of 150%, a minimum interest coverage ratio of 125%, and a minimum stockholders' equity threshold. Moreover, the fixed rate of the 2025 Notes is subject to a 1.00% increase in the event that a Below Investment Grade Event (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) occurs, which risk is increased as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 6. Borrowings\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the terms of the Credit Facility, the 2022 Notes, and the 2025 Notes.\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our unfunded commitments totaled $132.3 million and $226.1 million, respectively, of which $17.5 million and $59.3 million, respectively, was dependent upon the portfolio companies reaching certain milestones before the debt commitment becomes available to them. Our credit agreements contain customary lending provisions that allow us relief from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying portfolio company experiences material adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the portfolio company.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $325 million in total commitments available under the Credit Facility (see Recent Developments\u201d below for information regarding the increase in commitments under the Credit Facility subsequent to year-end), subject to various covenants and borrowing base requirements. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature, which allows us to increase the size of the Credit Facility to up to $400 million under certain circumstances. The revolving period under the Credit Facility expires on November 30, 2022, and the maturity date of the Credit Facility is May 31, 2024 (unless otherwise terminated earlier pursuant to its terms). Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the sum of (i) a floating rate based on certain indices, including LIBOR and commercial paper rates (subject to a floor of 0.50%), plus (ii) a margin of 2.80% if facility utilization is greater than or equal to 75%, 2.90% if utilization is greater than or equal to 50%, 3.00% if utilization is less than 50% and 4.5% during the amortization period. See Note 6. Borrowings\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the terms of the Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our unfunded commitments to 16 companies totaled $132.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $160.7 million in unfunded commitments expired or were terminated.\nOur investment objective is to maximize our total return to stockholders primarily in the form of current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by lending primarily with warrants to venture growth stage companies focused in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries backed by TPC's select group of leading venture capital investors.\n(4)Not applicable for the Credit Facility and 2025 Notes as they are not registered for public trading. For the 6.75% Notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes\u201d), the amounts represent the average of the daily closing prices on the NYSE for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the period from August 4, 2015 (date of issuance) through December 31, 2015. For the 2022 Notes, the amount represents the average of the daily closing prices on the NYSE for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, and the period from July 14, 2017 (date of issuance) through December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized net realized losses from the sale of investments of $0.6 million, primarily as a result of the write-off of investments in one portfolio company, partially offset by a realized gain from the sale of an equity investment.\nDistributions\n(2)The weighted average portfolio yields on total debt investments reflected above do not represent actual investment returns to our stockholders.\n(5)The 2020 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2025 Notes are disclosed at the aggregate principal amount outstanding.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized net realized gains of $8.6 million from the sale of investments, consisting of $28.8 million of realized gains from the sale of publicly traded shares held in CrowdStrike, Inc. and Medallia, Inc., and $0.8 million of realized gains from the sale of warrants in Freshly Inc., offset by $20.1 million of realized losses from the finalization of asset sales and removal from our investment portfolio of three obligors, Cambridge Broadband Network Limited, Harvest Power, Inc., and Munchery, Inc., which were rated Red (5) on our credit watch list, and $0.9 million of other net realized losses.\nOn July 14, 2017, we completed a public offering of $65.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes and received net proceeds of $62.8 million, after the payment of fees and offering costs. On July 24, 2017, as a result of the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional 2022 Notes, we issued an additional $9.75 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes and received net proceeds of $9.5 million, after the payment of fees and offering costs. The interest on the 2022 Notes, which accrues at an annual rate of 5.75%, is payable quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15. The maturity date of the 2022 Notes is July 15, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 195 investments in 69 companies. Our investments included 94 debt investments, 75 warrant investments, and 26 direct equity and related investments. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate cost and fair value of these investments were $662.4 million and $633.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, one of our portfolio companies was publicly traded. As of December 31, 2020, the 94 debt investments had an aggregate fair value of $583.3 million and a weighted average loan to enterprise value ratio at the time of underwriting of 8.9%. Enterprise value of a portfolio company is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of equity funding, at the time of origination.\nNet change in unrealized losses during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $5.9 million, which primarily consisted of the reversal and recognition of previously recorded net unrealized gains of $1.9 million into income or realized gains, and $4.0 million of net unrealized losses on our investment portfolio related to mark to market activity.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand, our available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations, including from contractual monthly portfolio company payments and cash flows, prepayments, and the ability to liquidate publicly traded investments, will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations. This Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section should be read in conjunction with COVID-19 Developments\u201d above and Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn June 21, 2018, our stockholders voted at a special meeting of stockholders to approve a proposal to authorize us to be subject to a reduced asset coverage ratio of at least 150% under the 1940 Act. As a result of the stockholder approval at the special meeting, effective June 22, 2018, our applicable minimum asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act has been decreased to 150% from 200%. Thus, we are permitted under the 1940 Act, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. As of December 31, 2020, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 252%.\n*Amount represents less than 0.05% of the total portfolio investments.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, distributions paid were comprised of interest-sourced distributions (qualified interest income) in amounts equal to 93.5% and 98.8% of total distributions paid, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we estimated that we had undistributed taxable earnings from net investment income and realized gains (or Spillover Income\u201d) of $16.2 million, or $0.53 per share.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into commitments with 11 new portfolio companies and 12 existing portfolio companies totaling $276.7 million, funded 42 debt investments for $204.6 million in principal value, acquired warrant investments representing $3.8 million of value, and made equity investments of $2.3 million and sold equity in two portfolio companies for $29.9 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities, consisting primarily of purchases, sales and repayments of investments and the items described in Results of Operations,\u201d was $60.6 million, and net cash used in financing activities was $42.3 million due to net repayments under the Credit Facility of $144.3 million, $42.5 million in distributions paid, and $2.8 million of deferred Credit Facility costs, partially offset by net proceeds received from our January 2020 public follow-on offering of common stock and the issuance of the 2025 Notes in March 2020. As of December 31, 2020, cash, including restricted cash, was $44.7 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had outstanding borrowings of $118.0 million and $262.3 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility, excluding deferred credit facility costs of $3.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively, which is included in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. We had $207.0 million and $37.7 million of remaining capacity on our Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n_______________\nOperating Expenses\nOur level of investment activity can vary substantially from period to period as our Adviser chooses to slow or accelerate new business originations depending on market conditions, rate of investment of TPC's select group of leading venture capital investors, our Adviser's knowledge, expertise and experience, our funding capacity (including availability under the Credit Facility and our ability or inability to raise equity or debt capital), and other market dynamics.\nOur shares are currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE\u201d) under the symbol TPVG\u201d. The 2022 Notes are currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol TPVY\u201d.\nUnderstanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. We consider valuation of investments and unrealized gains or losses to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the weighted average investment ranking of our debt investment portfolio was 2.13. During the year ended December 31, 2020, portfolio company credit category changes, excluding fundings and repayments, consisted of the following: one portfolio company with a principal balance of $25.0 million was upgraded from White (2) to Clear (1); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $16.4 million was upgraded from Yellow (3) to White (2); two portfolio companies with an aggregate principal balance of $61.2 million were downgraded from White (2) to Yellow (3); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $29.5 million was downgraded from White (2) to Red (5); and three portfolio companies with an aggregate principal balance of $21.2 million were removed from Red (5) and from our investment portfolio as a result of the finalization of asset sales.\nCommitments\nInterest on the 2026 Notes will be due semiannually on March 19 and September 19 each year, beginning on September 19, 2021. The 2026 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option at par plus accrued interest to the prepayment date and, if applicable, a make-whole premium. In addition, we are obligated to offer to prepay the 2026 Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the date of prepayment, if certain change in control events occur. The 2026 Notes are our general unsecured obligations that rank pari passu with all outstanding and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness issued by us; provided, however, in the event that we create, incur, assume or permit to exist liens on or with respect to any of our property or assets in connection with future secured indebtedness of more than an aggregate principal amount of $25 million, the 2026 Notes and the 2025 Notes will generally become secured concurrently therewith, equally and ratably with such indebtedness. The other terms and conditions applicable to the 2026 Notes under the Note\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have recorded in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities our liability for the 2025 Notes, net of deferred issuance costs, of $69.1 million. See Note 6. Borrowings\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the 2025 Notes.\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nOur weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments may be higher than an investor's yield on an investment in shares of our common stock. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments does not reflect operating expenses that may be incurred by us and, thus, by our stockholders. In addition, our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures do not represent actual investment returns to stockholders. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures are subject to change and, in the future, may be greater or less than the rates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Total return based on NAV is the change in ending NAV per share plus distributions per share paid during the period assuming participation in our dividend reinvestment plan divided by the beginning NAV per share for such period. Total return based on stock price is the change in the ending stock price of our common stock plus distributions paid during the period assuming participation in our dividend reinvestment plan divided by the beginning stock price of our common stock for such period. The total return is for the period shown and is not annualized.\nAs discussed below under Results of Operations,\u201d our net asset value per share as of December 31, 2020 decreased moderately as compared to our net asset value per share as of December 31, 2019. Any significant increase in aggregate unrealized depreciation of our investment portfolio or significant reductions in our net asset value as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise increases the risk of failing to meet the 1940 Act asset coverage requirements and breaching covenants under the Credit Facility, under the indenture governing the 2022 Notes, and under the Note Purchase Agreement governing the 2025 Notes, or otherwise triggering an event of default under the relevant borrowing arrangement. Any such breach of covenant or event of default, if we are not able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or debt holders, would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. See Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A for more information. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act, and we were not in breach of any covenants under the Credit Facility, under the indenture governing the 2022 Notes, or under the Note Purchase Agreement governing the 2025 Notes. We do not expect to breach any of these covenants in the near term assuming that conditions do not materially deteriorate further or for a prolonged period of time.\n(3)The amount to which such class of senior security would be entitled upon the involuntary liquidation of the issuer in preference to any security junior to it. The -\u201d indicates information which the SEC expressly does not require to be disclosed for certain types of senior securities.\nTo the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for the year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders. Our Adviser monitors available taxable earnings, including net investment income and realized capital gains, to determine if a return of capital may occur for the year. We estimate the source of our distributions as required by Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act to determine whether payment of dividends are expected to be paid from any other source other than net investment income accrued for current period or certain cumulative periods, but we will not be able to determine whether any specific distribution will be treated as made out of our taxable earnings or as a return of capital until after the end of our taxable year. Any amount treated as a return of capital will reduce a stockholder's adjusted tax basis in his or her common stock, thereby increasing his or her potential gain or reducing his or her potential loss on the subsequent sale or other disposition of his or her common stock. On a quarterly basis, for any payment of dividends estimated to be paid from any other source other than net investment income accrued for current period or certain cumulative periods based on the Section 19(a) requirement, we post a Section 19(a) notice through the Depository Trust Company's Legal Notice System and our website, as well as send our registered stockholders a printed copy of such notice along with the dividend payment. The estimates of the source of the distribution are interim estimates based on GAAP that are subject to revision, and the exact character of the distributions for tax purposes cannot be determined until the final books and records are finalized for the calendar year. Therefore, these estimates are made solely in order to comply with the requirements of Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act and should not be relied upon for tax reporting or any other purposes and could differ significantly from the actual character of distributions for tax purposes.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement\u201d, which is intended to improve the effectiveness of fair value measurement disclosures. The amendment, among other things, affects certain disclosure requirements related to transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and Level 3 fair value measurements as they relate to valuation process, unrealized gains and losses, measurement uncertainty, and significant unobservable inputs. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of these rules did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n\u2022the length and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States as well as worldwide, and the magnitude of its impact and time required for economic recovery, including with respect to the impact of travel restrictions and other isolation and quarantine measures on the ability of the Adviser's investment professionals to conduct in-person diligence on, and otherwise monitor, existing and future investments;", "item_7_text": "For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest and fees on our borrowings totaled $15.5 million and $12.4 million, respectively. Interest and fee expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019, increased due to the issuance of the 2025 Notes, as well as a higher weighted-average outstanding principal balance on our Credit Facility, partially offset by a decrease in interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nThe following table shows the total portfolio investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\nThe yield on our total debt portfolio, excluding the impact of prepayments, was 12.5% and 13.1% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n _____________\n\u2022our expected financings and investments;\n\u2022our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies;\nWe have seen, and expect to continue to see, certain of our portfolio companies experience financial distress and, depending on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent of its disruption to operations, expect that certain of our portfolio companies may default on their financial obligations to us and their other capital providers. In addition, as a result of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related disruption and financial distress, certain portfolio companies may seek to modify their loans from us, which could reduce the amount or extend the time for payment of principal, reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest, and/or increase the amount of PIK interest we receive with respect to such investment, among other things. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have also impeded, and may continue to impede, the ability of certain of our portfolio companies to raise additional capital and/or pursue asset sales or otherwise execute strategic transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on the valuation of our investments in such companies. Portfolio companies operating in certain industries may be more susceptible to these risks than other portfolio companies in other industries in light of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of our portfolio companies have already taken steps to significantly reduce, modify, or alter business strategies and operations, and we expect that additional portfolio companies may take similar steps if subjected to prolonged and severe financial distress, which may impair their business on a permanent basis. In addition, due to the completion of equity rounds by certain portfolio companies at lower valuations than rounds completed prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced unrealized depreciation on certain of our warrant and equity investments despite the relevant companies' ability to mitigate disruptions on their business strategies and operations. There can be no assurance that future equity rounds completed by our portfolio companies will be at levels greater than or equal to previous rounds, which may result in net unrealized depreciation on our warrant and equity portfolio in future periods.\nAs a BDC, we generally have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. As a result, we expect, from time to time, to access the debt and equity markets when we believe it is necessary and appropriate to do so. In this regard, we continue to explore various options for obtaining additional debt or equity capital for investments. This may include expanding or extending the Credit Facility or the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or debt securities. If we are unable to obtain leverage or raise equity capital on terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to grow our portfolio could be substantially impacted.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have recorded in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities our liability for the 2022 Notes, net of deferred issuance costs, of $74.0 million and $73.5 million, respectively. See Note 6. Borrowings\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the 2022 Notes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our total return during the period based on the change in NAV plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was 14.2% and our total return during the period based on the change in stock price plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was 7.7%. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our total return during the period based on the change in NAV plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was 9.5% and our total return during the period based on the change in stock price plus distributions reinvested as of the respective distribution dates was 44.7%.\nThere was no capital gains incentive fee expense calculated for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNet Realized Gains and Losses and Net Unrealized Gains and Losses\nConsistent with TPC's existing policies, our Adviser maintains a credit watch list which places borrowers into five risk categories based on our Adviser's senior investment team's judgment, where 1 is the highest rating and all new loans are generally assigned a rating of 2.\n\u2022the dependence of our future success on the U.S. and global economies, including with respect to the industries in which we invest;\n(1)The amount of this initial distribution reflected a quarterly distribution rate of $0.30 per share, prorated for the 27 days for the period from the pricing of our initial public offering on March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations), through March 31, 2014.\nThe following table shows a summary of our payment obligations for repayment of debt as of December 31, 2020:\n(3)Included as a reference point for coupon income and weighted average portfolio yield.\nOn January 29, 2021, we amended the Credit Facility to increase the capacity of the Credit Facility to $350 million from $325 million and add a new lender. The $25 million increase in the capacity of the Credit Facility was made under the accordion feature in the Credit Facility.\nSet forth below is a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The comparison of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 can be found within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in Part II of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $2.6 million in other income consisting of $1.4 million from the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments, and $1.2 million from the realization of certain fees paid by portfolio companies and other income related to prepayment activity. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $2.9 million in other income consisting of $1.7 million from the termination or expiration of unfunded commitments, and $1.2 million from the realization of certain fees paid by portfolio companies and other income related to prepayment activity.\nItem 7.

Refer to Investment Activity\u201d above.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and the related effect on the U.S. and global economies, including the recent economic downturn and the uncertainty associated with the timing and likelihood of economic recovery, has had adverse consequences for the business operations of some of our portfolio companies and has adversely affected, and threatens to continue to adversely affect, our operations and the operations of the Adviser.\n _____________\n\u2022our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties;\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $31.8 million, which was comprised of $38.3 million of net investment income and $6.5 million of net realized and unrealized losses. On a per share basis for the year ended December 31, 2019, net investment income was $1.54 per share and the net increase in net assets from operations was $1.28 per share.\n(1)Does not include backlog of potential future commitments.\nOverview\n(1)Includes backlog of potential future commitments.\nAdministration agreement and general and administrative expenses totaled $6.7 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019, was primarily due to increased use of professional services and a higher overhead allocation between the periods, partially offset by lower third-party expenses as a result of internalization of third-party services by the Administrator.\nCredit Facility\n\u2022the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A, and in our other filings with the SEC that we make from time to time.\n(1)Total amount of senior securities outstanding at the end of the period presented (in thousands).\nInformation about our senior securities is shown in the following table as of each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The report of Deloitte & Touche, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, on the Senior Securities table as of December 31, 2020, is attached as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCash Flows\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total operating expenses were $43.3 million as compared to $35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe following table shows the debt commitments, fundings of debt investments (principal balance) and equity investments and non-binding term sheet activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nWe calculate weighted average annualized portfolio yields for periods shown as the annualized rates of the interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio during the period. The weighted average yields reported for these periods are annualized and reflect the weighted average yields to maturities. Should the portfolio companies choose to repay their loans earlier, our weighted average yields will increase for those debt investments affected but may reduce our weighted average yields on the remaining portfolio in future quarters.\n\u2022the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies.\nAn important measure of our financial performance is net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized gains (losses). Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses including interest on borrowed funds. Net realized gains (losses) on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net unrealized gains (losses) on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio.\n _______________\n(1)Represents non-duplicative number of companies.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 187 investments in 68 companies. Our investments included 102 debt investments, 64 warrant investments, and 21 direct equity and related investments. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate cost and fair value of these investments were $660.7 million and $653.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, two of our portfolio companies were publicly traded. As of December 31, 2019, the 102 debt investments had an aggregate fair value of $604.5 million and a weighted average loan to enterprise value ratio at the time of underwriting of 9.3%. Enterprise value of a portfolio company is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of equity funding, at the time of origination.\nWe originate and invest primarily in venture growth stage companies. Companies at the venture growth stage have distinct characteristics differentiating them from venture capital-backed companies at other stages in their development lifecycle. We invest primarily in (i) growth capital loans that have a secured collateral position and that are generally used by venture growth stage companies to finance their continued expansion and growth, (ii) equipment financings, which may be structured as loans or leases, that have a secured collateral position on specified mission-critical equipment, (iii) on a select basis, revolving loans that have a secured collateral position and that are typically used by venture growth stage companies to advance against inventory, components, accounts receivable, contractual or future billings, bookings, revenues, sales or cash payments and collections including proceeds from a sale, financing or the equivalent and (iv) direct equity investments in venture growth stage companies. In connection with our growth capital loans, equipment financings and revolving loans, we generally receive warrant investments that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation of our borrowers and enhance our overall investment returns.\n2022 Notes\n\u2022the performance of our existing portfolio and other investments we may make in the future;\n\u2022our ability to qualify and maintain our qualification as a RIC and as a BDC;\nTotal operating expenses consist of base management fee, income incentive fee, capital gains incentive fee, interest expense and amortization of fees, administration agreement expenses, and general and administrative expenses. In determining the base management fee, our Adviser has agreed to exclude U.S. Treasury bill assets acquired at the end of each applicable quarter from the calculation of the gross assets. We anticipate operating expenses will increase over time as our portfolio continues to grow. However, we anticipate operating expenses, as a percentage of totals assets and net assets, will generally decrease over time as our portfolio and capital base expand. We expect base management and income incentive fees will increase as we grow our asset base and our earnings. The capital gains incentive fee will depend on realized and unrealized gains and losses. Interest expenses will generally increase as we utilize more of the Credit Facility and issue additional debt securities, and we generally expect expenses under the administration agreement and general and administrative expenses to increase over time to meet the additional requirements associated with servicing a larger portfolio.\nThese statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation:\nThese critical accounting policies and estimates, and any changes thereto, are discussed under Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 4. Investments\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn January 11, 2021, we sold our investments in portfolio company Knotel, Inc. ( Knotel\u201d) to a third party for gross proceeds of approximately $15.0 million plus potential equity in its post-bankruptcy entity. On January 31, 2021, Knotel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The fair value of our investments in Knotel as of December 31, 2020 was $15.0 million, reflecting cash proceeds received in January 2021.\n_______________\nPortfolio Composition\nDistribution\n\nWhile we have been monitoring, and continue to monitor, the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our and our portfolio companies' business, we have continued to raise capital, maintain appropriate levels of available liquidity, support and monitor our existing portfolio companies, fund existing unfunded commitments, and selectively deploy capital in new investment opportunities in venture growth stage companies. As a result of our focus on maintaining adequate liquidity amid current market uncertainty, our interest expense has increased from comparable prior year periods due to maintaining a higher weighted average outstanding principal balance on borrowings and increased cash reserves.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used by operating activities, consisting primarily of purchases, sales and repayments of investments and the items described in Results of Operations,\u201d was $187.5 million and net cash provided by financing activities was $204.0 million due to net borrowings under the Credit Facility of $239.3 million, $33.8 million in distributions paid, and $1.5 million of deferred credit facility costs. As of December 31, 2019, cash, including restricted cash, was $26.4 million.\nCapital Resources and Borrowings\n(1)Debt balance is net of fees and discounts applied to the loan at origination.\nInvestment income includes interest income on our debt investments utilizing the effective yield method including cash interest income as well as the amortization of any purchase premium, accretion of purchase discount, original issue discount, facilities fees, and the amortization and payment of the end-of-term ( EOT\u201d) payments. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest income totaled $88.6 million and $70.5 million, respectively, representing a weighted average annualized portfolio yield on total debt investments for the period held of 13.8% and 15.0%, respectively.\nForward-Looking Statements\n(2)Represents a special distribution.\nAmendment to the Credit Facility\nComparison of operating results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nOn March 1, 2021, we issued $200,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of our 4.50% Series 2021A Senior Notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes\u201d). The 2026 Notes were issued in a private placement to certain qualified institutional investors, pursuant to the terms of the First Supplement, dated as of March 1, 2021 (the First Supplement\u201d), to the Note Purchase Agreement. The 2026 Notes bear a fixed interest rate of 4.50% per year and will mature on March 1, 2026, unless redeemed, purchased or prepaid by us prior to such date in accordance with their terms. In the event that a Below Investment Grade Event (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) occurs, the 2026 Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.50% per year from the date of the occurrence of the Below Investment Grade Event to and until the date on which the Below Investment Grade Event is no longer continuing.\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and schedules thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as otherwise specified, references to the Company\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d, and our\u201d refer to TriplePoint Venture Growth BDC Corp. and its subsidiaries.\nOn May 6, 2020, we entered into an unsecured revolving loan agreement (the Adviser Revolver\u201d) with the Adviser, which had a maximum credit limit of $50.0 million. The Adviser Revolver expired on December 31, 2020 without us having drawn or otherwise borrowed any amounts thereunder.\nAsset Quality\n _____________\nPortfolio Yield and Total Return\nWe may enter into commitments with certain portfolio companies that permit an increase in the commitment amount in the future in the event that conditions to such increases are met ( backlog of potential future commitments\u201d). If such conditions to increase are met, these amounts may become unfunded commitments if not drawn prior to expiration. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, this backlog of potential future commitments totaled $20.8 million and $15.5 million, respectively.\nWe were formed to expand the venture growth stage business segment of TPC's investment platform. TPC is widely recognized as a leading global financing provider devoted to serving venture capital-backed companies with creative, flexible and customized debt financing, equity capital and complementary services throughout their lifespan. TPC is located on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley and has a primary focus in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries.\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations, changes in political, economic or industry conditions, and changes in the interest rate environment or other conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, including with respect to changes resulting from or in response to, or potentially even the absence of changes as a result of, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\nIn part due to these COVID-19-related developments, the fair value of certain of our portfolio investments as of December 31, 2020 and our expected recoveries for certain investments have decreased as compared to their fair value and expected recoveries as of December 31, 2019, and there may be further decreases in the fair values of our portfolio investments going forward. As of December 31, 2020, we had two portfolio companies in which our investments were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate cost and fair value of $61.8 million and $36.4 million, respectively. The various effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those discussed above, increase the risk that we will place additional investments on non-accrual status in the future.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we entered into commitments with 18 new portfolio companies and 11 existing portfolio companies totaling $507.4 million, funded 72 debt investments for $418.1 million in principal value, acquired warrant investments representing $6.6 million of value, made equity investments of $3.3 million and sold equity in one portfolio company for $1.4 million.\n _______________\nAs of December 31, 2019, the weighted average investment ranking of our debt investment portfolio was 1.94. During the year ended December 31, 2019, portfolio company credit category changes, excluding fundings and repayments, consisted of the following: three portfolio companies with an aggregate principal balance of $24.7 million were upgraded from White (2) to Clear (1); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $10.4 million was upgraded from Orange (4) to Yellow (3); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $5.7 million was downgraded from Clear (1) to White (2); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $10.0 million was downgraded from White (2) to Yellow (3); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $20.0 million was downgraded from Yellow (3) to Orange (4); and two portfolio companies with an aggregate principal balance of $19.9 million were downgraded from Yellow (3) to Red (5).\n(1)Represents non-duplicative number of companies.\n\nGrowth capital loans in which the borrower held a term loan facility, with or without an accompanying revolving loan, in priority to our senior lien represent 30.6% and 31.0% of our debt investments at fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(1)The yields for periods shown are the annualized rates of interest income or the components of interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio during the period.\n*Amount represents less than 0.05% of the total portfolio investments.\n\u2022our relationships with third parties, including but not limited to lenders and venture capital investors, including other investors in our portfolio companies;\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total investment income was $91.2 million as compared to $73.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, is primarily due to higher weighted average principal outstanding on our income-bearing debt investment portfolio, partially offset by a lower effective yield due to lower prepayment activity and a decrease in the Prime Rate.\nNet change in unrealized losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $21.1 million, resulting primarily from the reversal and recognition of $14.3 million of previously recorded unrealized gains associated with the shares of CrowdStrike, Inc. and Medallia, Inc. that we sold during the year, as well as net unrealized losses on our investment portfolio during the year resulting from fair value adjustments, partially offset by the reversal and recognition of $19.4 million of previously recorded unrealized losses associated with three obligors rated Red (5) on our credit watch list.\n\nRealized gains and losses are included in net realized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\n2025 Notes\n\u2022an economic downturn and the time period required for robust economic recovery therefrom, including the current economic downturn as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already generally had a material impact on our portfolio companies' results of operations and financial condition and will likely continue to have a material impact on our portfolio companies' results of operations and financial condition, for its duration, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition;\nSet forth below is a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. A discussion of our liquidity and capital resources as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 can be found within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in Part II of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nOn March 19, 2020, we completed a private offering of $70.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes and received net proceeds of $69.1 million, after the payment of fees and offering costs. The interest on the 2025 Notes, which accrues at an annual rate of 4.50%, is payable semiannually on March 19 and September 19 each year, beginning on September 19, 2020. The maturity date of the 2025 Notes is March 19, 2025.\nThe following table shows our unfunded commitments by portfolio company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nInvestment Income\n\u2022the adequacy of our available liquidity, cash resources and working capital and compliance with covenants under our borrowing arrangements; and\nContractual Obligations\nIssuance of 4.50% Series 2021A Senior Notes Due 2026\nNet change in realized and unrealized gains or losses in subsequent periods may be volatile as such results depend on changes in the market, changes in the underlying performance of our portfolio companies and their respective industries, and other market factors.\nAdviser Revolver\nThe 2026 Notes were offered in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of Securities Act. The 2026 Notes have not and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act, as applicable.\nThe table below shows our return on average total assets and return on average NAV for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\u2022actual and potential conflicts of interest with TPC, the Adviser and its senior investment team and Investment Committee;\nThe following table shows the financing product type of our debt investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nFrom January 1, 2021 through March 2, 2021, we closed $48.4 million of additional debt commitments and funded $42.9 million in new investments. TPC's direct originations platform entered into $58.1 million of additional non-binding signed term sheets with venture growth stage companies. These investment opportunities for us are subject to due diligence, definitive documentation and investment committee approval, as well as compliance with TPC's allocation policy. From January 1, 2021 through March 2, 2021, we received $17.4 million of principal prepayments generating approximately $0.5 million of accelerated income.\n\u2022currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. dollars;\nThe fair value at the inception of the delay draw credit agreements with our portfolio companies is equal to the fees and/or warrants received to enter into these agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit profile. The unfunded commitment liability reflects the fair value of these future funding commitments. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value for these unfunded commitments totaled $1.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively, and was included in other accrued expenses and liabilities\u201d in our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nRecent Developments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we received $164.1 million of debt prepayments and $37.5 million of scheduled amortization and repayments.\n\u2022the expected market for venture capital investments;\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $35.3 million, which was comprised of $47.9 million of net investment income and $12.5 million of net realized and unrealized losses. On a per share basis for the year ended December 31, 2020, net investment income was $1.57 per share and the net increase in net assets from operations was $1.16 per share.\nSenior Securities\nCOVID-19 Developments\nOn February 24, 2021, the Board declared a $0.36 per share regular quarterly distribution, payable on March 31, 2021 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2021.\nThe following table shows additional information on our unfunded commitments regarding milestones, expirations, and types of loans as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\u2022risks associated with possible disruption in our or our portfolio companies' operations due to wars and other forms of conflict, terrorist acts, security operations and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and global health epidemics; and\n\u2022interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly given that we use leverage as part of our investment strategy;\n _______________\nThe following table shows the weighted average annualized portfolio yield on our total debt portfolio comprising of cash interest income, accretion of the net purchase discount, facilities fees and the value of warrant investments received, accretion of EOT payments and the accelerated receipt of EOT payments on prepayments:\nBase management fees totaled $12.4 million and $8.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Base management fees for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019, increased primarily due to an increase in the average size of our portfolio between periods.\n\u2022the ability of our Adviser to attract, retain and have access to highly talented professionals, including our Adviser's senior management team;\nRecent Portfolio Activity\nAsset Coverage Requirements\nAlthough we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include, without limitation, our ability to originate new loans and investments, borrowing costs and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following tables show information on the cost and fair value of our investments in companies along with the number of companies in our portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we received $138.1 million of principal prepayments, $17.0 million of early repayments, and $48.3 million of scheduled principal amortization.\n _______________\nThe following table shows our cash distributions per share that have been authorized by our Board since our initial public offering to December 31, 2020. From March 5, 2014 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2015, and during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, distributions represent ordinary income as our earnings exceeded distributions. Approximately $0.24 per share of the distributions during the year ended December 31, 2016 represented a return of capital. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, distributions represent ordinary income and long term capital gains. Depending on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent of its impact on our portfolio companies' operations and our net investment income, any future distributions to our stockholders may be for amounts less than our historical distributions, may be made less frequently than historical practices, and may be made in part cash and part stock (as per each stockholder's election), subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution.\nIncome incentive fees totaled $8.7 million and $8.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our income incentive fee was reduced by $2.6 million due to the total return requirement under the income component of our incentive fee structure, which resulted in a corresponding increase of $2.6 million in net investment income. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our income incentive fee was reduced by $1.2 million due to the total return requirement under the income component of our incentive fee structure, which resulted in a corresponding increase of approximately $1.2 million in net investment income.\n _______________\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d plans,\u201d will,\u201d may,\u201d continue,\u201d believes,\u201d seeks,\u201d estimates,\u201d would,\u201d could,\u201d should,\u201d targets,\u201d projects,\u201d and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include statements as to:\n\u2022our and our portfolio companies' future operating results and financial condition, including the ability of us and our portfolio companies to achieve our respective objectives;\n(1)The average net asset values and the average total assets are computed based on daily balances.\nWe will continue to monitor the evolving situation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related guidance from U.S. and international authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities. Given the dynamic nature of this situation and the fact that there may be developments outside of our control that require us or our portfolio companies to adjust plans of operation, we cannot reasonably estimate the full impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future. However, it could have a material adverse impact for a prolonged period of time on our future net investment income, particularly with respect to our interest income, the fair value of our portfolio investments, and the results of operations and financial condition of us and our portfolio companies. See Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A, and in our other filings with the SEC that we make from time to time, for more information.\n(2)Asset coverage per unit is the ratio of the carrying value of our total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, in relation to the aggregate amount of senior securities representing indebtedness. Asset coverage per unit is expressed in terms of dollar amounts per $1,000 of indebtedness.\nOur credit agreements contain customary lending provisions that allow us relief from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying company experiences material adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the company. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for us. We generally expect 50% - 75% of our gross unfunded commitments to eventually be drawn before the expiration of their corresponding availability periods.\nWe have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. To obtain and maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute at least 90% of our net ordinary income and net realized short-term capital gains in excess of our net realized long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders. In order to avoid a non-deductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on certain of our undistributed income, we would need to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: (a) 98% of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for such calendar year; (b) 98.2% of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made by us to use our taxable year); and (c) certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. For the tax years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we were subject to a 4% U.S. federal excise tax and we may be subject to this tax in future years. In such cases, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.\n\u2022the impact and timing of our unfunded commitments;\n_____________\nUnrealized gains and losses are included in net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPortfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Asset Quality\n\u2022a contraction of available credit, an inability or unwillingness of our lenders to fund their commitments to us and/or an inability to access capital markets or additional sources of liquidity, including as a result of the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and impair our lending and investment activities;\nAs of December 31, 2019, our unfunded commitments to 15 companies totaled $226.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $167.1 million in unfunded commitments expired or were terminated.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference rate reform (Topic 848)-Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting.\u201d The amendments in this update provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to certain contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform and became effective upon issuance for all entities. The standard is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The adoption of these rules did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following tables show the fair value of the portfolio of investments, by industry and the percentage of the total investment portfolio, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\n _______________\nPurchase Agreement, as modified by the First Supplement, including events of default and affirmative and negative covenants, are substantially similar to the terms and conditions applicable to the 2025 Notes.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we are permitted under the 1940 Act, as a BDC, to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150% after such borrowing. In addition, the indenture governing the 2022 Notes contains certain covenants, including covenants (i) requiring our compliance with the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act (after giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC); and (ii) if our asset coverage has been below the 1940 Act minimum asset coverage requirements (after giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC) for more than six consecutive months, prohibiting the declaration of any cash dividend or distribution on our common stock (except to the extent necessary for us to maintain our treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code), or purchasing any of our common stock, unless, at the time of the declaration of the dividend or distribution or the purchase, and after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution, or purchase, we are in compliance with the 1940 Act asset coverage requirements (after giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC). The Credit Facility also includes certain covenants, including without limitation, a covenant requiring 150% asset coverage in accordance with the 1940 Act, and the Note Purchase Agreement governing the 2025 Notes contains certain covenants, including without limitation, a minimum asset coverage ratio of 150%, a minimum interest coverage ratio of 125%, and a minimum stockholders' equity threshold. Moreover, the fixed rate of the 2025 Notes is subject to a 1.00% increase in the event that a Below Investment Grade Event (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) occurs, which risk is increased as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 6. Borrowings\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the terms of the Credit Facility, the 2022 Notes, and the 2025 Notes.\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our unfunded commitments totaled $132.3 million and $226.1 million, respectively, of which $17.5 million and $59.3 million, respectively, was dependent upon the portfolio companies reaching certain milestones before the debt commitment becomes available to them. Our credit agreements contain customary lending provisions that allow us relief from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying portfolio company experiences material adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the portfolio company.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $325 million in total commitments available under the Credit Facility (see Recent Developments\u201d below for information regarding the increase in commitments under the Credit Facility subsequent to year-end), subject to various covenants and borrowing base requirements. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature, which allows us to increase the size of the Credit Facility to up to $400 million under certain circumstances. The revolving period under the Credit Facility expires on November 30, 2022, and the maturity date of the Credit Facility is May 31, 2024 (unless otherwise terminated earlier pursuant to its terms). Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the sum of (i) a floating rate based on certain indices, including LIBOR and commercial paper rates (subject to a floor of 0.50%), plus (ii) a margin of 2.80% if facility utilization is greater than or equal to 75%, 2.90% if utilization is greater than or equal to 50%, 3.00% if utilization is less than 50% and 4.5% during the amortization period. See Note 6. Borrowings\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the terms of the Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our unfunded commitments to 16 companies totaled $132.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $160.7 million in unfunded commitments expired or were terminated.\nOur investment objective is to maximize our total return to stockholders primarily in the form of current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by lending primarily with warrants to venture growth stage companies focused in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries backed by TPC's select group of leading venture capital investors.\n(4)Not applicable for the Credit Facility and 2025 Notes as they are not registered for public trading. For the 6.75% Notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes\u201d), the amounts represent the average of the daily closing prices on the NYSE for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the period from August 4, 2015 (date of issuance) through December 31, 2015. For the 2022 Notes, the amount represents the average of the daily closing prices on the NYSE for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, and the period from July 14, 2017 (date of issuance) through December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized net realized losses from the sale of investments of $0.6 million, primarily as a result of the write-off of investments in one portfolio company, partially offset by a realized gain from the sale of an equity investment.\nDistributions\n(2)The weighted average portfolio yields on total debt investments reflected above do not represent actual investment returns to our stockholders.\n(5)The 2020 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2025 Notes are disclosed at the aggregate principal amount outstanding.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized net realized gains of $8.6 million from the sale of investments, consisting of $28.8 million of realized gains from the sale of publicly traded shares held in CrowdStrike, Inc. and Medallia, Inc., and $0.8 million of realized gains from the sale of warrants in Freshly Inc., offset by $20.1 million of realized losses from the finalization of asset sales and removal from our investment portfolio of three obligors, Cambridge Broadband Network Limited, Harvest Power, Inc., and Munchery, Inc., which were rated Red (5) on our credit watch list, and $0.9 million of other net realized losses.\nOn July 14, 2017, we completed a public offering of $65.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes and received net proceeds of $62.8 million, after the payment of fees and offering costs. On July 24, 2017, as a result of the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional 2022 Notes, we issued an additional $9.75 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes and received net proceeds of $9.5 million, after the payment of fees and offering costs. The interest on the 2022 Notes, which accrues at an annual rate of 5.75%, is payable quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15. The maturity date of the 2022 Notes is July 15, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 195 investments in 69 companies. Our investments included 94 debt investments, 75 warrant investments, and 26 direct equity and related investments. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate cost and fair value of these investments were $662.4 million and $633.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, one of our portfolio companies was publicly traded. As of December 31, 2020, the 94 debt investments had an aggregate fair value of $583.3 million and a weighted average loan to enterprise value ratio at the time of underwriting of 8.9%. Enterprise value of a portfolio company is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of equity funding, at the time of origination.\nNet change in unrealized losses during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $5.9 million, which primarily consisted of the reversal and recognition of previously recorded net unrealized gains of $1.9 million into income or realized gains, and $4.0 million of net unrealized losses on our investment portfolio related to mark to market activity.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand, our available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations, including from contractual monthly portfolio company payments and cash flows, prepayments, and the ability to liquidate publicly traded investments, will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations. This Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section should be read in conjunction with COVID-19 Developments\u201d above and Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn June 21, 2018, our stockholders voted at a special meeting of stockholders to approve a proposal to authorize us to be subject to a reduced asset coverage ratio of at least 150% under the 1940 Act. As a result of the stockholder approval at the special meeting, effective June 22, 2018, our applicable minimum asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act has been decreased to 150% from 200%. Thus, we are permitted under the 1940 Act, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. As of December 31, 2020, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 252%.\n*Amount represents less than 0.05% of the total portfolio investments.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, distributions paid were comprised of interest-sourced distributions (qualified interest income) in amounts equal to 93.5% and 98.8% of total distributions paid, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we estimated that we had undistributed taxable earnings from net investment income and realized gains (or Spillover Income\u201d) of $16.2 million, or $0.53 per share.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into commitments with 11 new portfolio companies and 12 existing portfolio companies totaling $276.7 million, funded 42 debt investments for $204.6 million in principal value, acquired warrant investments representing $3.8 million of value, and made equity investments of $2.3 million and sold equity in two portfolio companies for $29.9 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities, consisting primarily of purchases, sales and repayments of investments and the items described in Results of Operations,\u201d was $60.6 million, and net cash used in financing activities was $42.3 million due to net repayments under the Credit Facility of $144.3 million, $42.5 million in distributions paid, and $2.8 million of deferred Credit Facility costs, partially offset by net proceeds received from our January 2020 public follow-on offering of common stock and the issuance of the 2025 Notes in March 2020. As of December 31, 2020, cash, including restricted cash, was $44.7 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had outstanding borrowings of $118.0 million and $262.3 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility, excluding deferred credit facility costs of $3.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively, which is included in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. We had $207.0 million and $37.7 million of remaining capacity on our Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n_______________\nOperating Expenses\nOur level of investment activity can vary substantially from period to period as our Adviser chooses to slow or accelerate new business originations depending on market conditions, rate of investment of TPC's select group of leading venture capital investors, our Adviser's knowledge, expertise and experience, our funding capacity (including availability under the Credit Facility and our ability or inability to raise equity or debt capital), and other market dynamics.\nOur shares are currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE\u201d) under the symbol TPVG\u201d. The 2022 Notes are currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol TPVY\u201d.\nUnderstanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. We consider valuation of investments and unrealized gains or losses to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the weighted average investment ranking of our debt investment portfolio was 2.13. During the year ended December 31, 2020, portfolio company credit category changes, excluding fundings and repayments, consisted of the following: one portfolio company with a principal balance of $25.0 million was upgraded from White (2) to Clear (1); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $16.4 million was upgraded from Yellow (3) to White (2); two portfolio companies with an aggregate principal balance of $61.2 million were downgraded from White (2) to Yellow (3); one portfolio company with a principal balance of $29.5 million was downgraded from White (2) to Red (5); and three portfolio companies with an aggregate principal balance of $21.2 million were removed from Red (5) and from our investment portfolio as a result of the finalization of asset sales.\nCommitments\nInterest on the 2026 Notes will be due semiannually on March 19 and September 19 each year, beginning on September 19, 2021. The 2026 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option at par plus accrued interest to the prepayment date and, if applicable, a make-whole premium. In addition, we are obligated to offer to prepay the 2026 Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the date of prepayment, if certain change in control events occur. The 2026 Notes are our general unsecured obligations that rank pari passu with all outstanding and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness issued by us; provided, however, in the event that we create, incur, assume or permit to exist liens on or with respect to any of our property or assets in connection with future secured indebtedness of more than an aggregate principal amount of $25 million, the 2026 Notes and the 2025 Notes will generally become secured concurrently therewith, equally and ratably with such indebtedness. The other terms and conditions applicable to the 2026 Notes under the Note\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have recorded in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities our liability for the 2025 Notes, net of deferred issuance costs, of $69.1 million. See Note 6. Borrowings\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the 2025 Notes.\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nOur weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments may be higher than an investor's yield on an investment in shares of our common stock. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments does not reflect operating expenses that may be incurred by us and, thus, by our stockholders. In addition, our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not consider the effect of any sales commissions or charges that may be incurred in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures do not represent actual investment returns to stockholders. Our weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments and total return figures are subject to change and, in the future, may be greater or less than the rates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Total return based on NAV is the change in ending NAV per share plus distributions per share paid during the period assuming participation in our dividend reinvestment plan divided by the beginning NAV per share for such period. Total return based on stock price is the change in the ending stock price of our common stock plus distributions paid during the period assuming participation in our dividend reinvestment plan divided by the beginning stock price of our common stock for such period. The total return is for the period shown and is not annualized.\nAs discussed below under Results of Operations,\u201d our net asset value per share as of December 31, 2020 decreased moderately as compared to our net asset value per share as of December 31, 2019. Any significant increase in aggregate unrealized depreciation of our investment portfolio or significant reductions in our net asset value as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise increases the risk of failing to meet the 1940 Act asset coverage requirements and breaching covenants under the Credit Facility, under the indenture governing the 2022 Notes, and under the Note Purchase Agreement governing the 2025 Notes, or otherwise triggering an event of default under the relevant borrowing arrangement. Any such breach of covenant or event of default, if we are not able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or debt holders, would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. See Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A for more information. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act, and we were not in breach of any covenants under the Credit Facility, under the indenture governing the 2022 Notes, or under the Note Purchase Agreement governing the 2025 Notes. We do not expect to breach any of these covenants in the near term assuming that conditions do not materially deteriorate further or for a prolonged period of time.\n(3)The amount to which such class of senior security would be entitled upon the involuntary liquidation of the issuer in preference to any security junior to it. The -\u201d indicates information which the SEC expressly does not require to be disclosed for certain types of senior securities.\nTo the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for the year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders. Our Adviser monitors available taxable earnings, including net investment income and realized capital gains, to determine if a return of capital may occur for the year. We estimate the source of our distributions as required by Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act to determine whether payment of dividends are expected to be paid from any other source other than net investment income accrued for current period or certain cumulative periods, but we will not be able to determine whether any specific distribution will be treated as made out of our taxable earnings or as a return of capital until after the end of our taxable year. Any amount treated as a return of capital will reduce a stockholder's adjusted tax basis in his or her common stock, thereby increasing his or her potential gain or reducing his or her potential loss on the subsequent sale or other disposition of his or her common stock. On a quarterly basis, for any payment of dividends estimated to be paid from any other source other than net investment income accrued for current period or certain cumulative periods based on the Section 19(a) requirement, we post a Section 19(a) notice through the Depository Trust Company's Legal Notice System and our website, as well as send our registered stockholders a printed copy of such notice along with the dividend payment. The estimates of the source of the distribution are interim estimates based on GAAP that are subject to revision, and the exact character of the distributions for tax purposes cannot be determined until the final books and records are finalized for the calendar year. Therefore, these estimates are made solely in order to comply with the requirements of Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act and should not be relied upon for tax reporting or any other purposes and could differ significantly from the actual character of distributions for tax purposes.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement\u201d, which is intended to improve the effectiveness of fair value measurement disclosures. The amendment, among other things, affects certain disclosure requirements related to transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and Level 3 fair value measurements as they relate to valuation process, unrealized gains and losses, measurement uncertainty, and significant unobservable inputs. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of these rules did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n\u2022the length and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States as well as worldwide, and the magnitude of its impact and time required for economic recovery, including with respect to the impact of travel restrictions and other isolation and quarantine measures on the ability of the Adviser's investment professionals to conduct in-person diligence on, and otherwise monitor, existing and future investments;", "item_7_tables": "Table 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Category </td> <td> </td> <td>Category Definition </td> <td> </td> <td>Action Item </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clear (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Performing above expectations and/or strong financial or enterprise profile, value or coverage. </td> <td> </td> <td>Review quarterly. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>White (2) </td> <td> </td> <td>Performing at expectations and/or reasonably close to it.

Interest and fees on borrowings increased in 2020 vs 2019 due to issuance of the 2025 Notes and higher weighted average outstanding principal balance on the Credit Facility.\n\n- Total investment income increased in 2020 vs 2019 primarily due to higher weighted average principal outstanding on the debt investment portfolio, partially offset by lower prepayment activity and decrease in Prime Rate.\n\n- Net investment income increased in 2020 vs 2019 primarily due to an increase in total investment income. \n\n- Net change in unrealized losses in 2020 resulted primarily from reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains, fair value adjustments, and offset by reversal of previously recorded unrealized losses.\n\n- Net realized gains in 2020 resulted primarily from gains on sale of investments in CrowdStrike and Medallia, offset by losses from removal of investments rated Red (5).\n\n- Net increase in net assets and earnings per share were higher in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\n- Asset coverage ratios remain above required minimums. No defaults or breaches of covenants were expected.\n\n- Unfunded commitments decreased from 2019 due to expirations and terminations. New commitments were made in 2020.\n\n- Liquidity remains adequate to meet obligations. Continued ability to access capital markets is important.\n\n- The COVID-19 pandemic has had adverse effects on some portfolio companies which may lead to defaults or rating downgrades. The situation continues to be monitored."}
