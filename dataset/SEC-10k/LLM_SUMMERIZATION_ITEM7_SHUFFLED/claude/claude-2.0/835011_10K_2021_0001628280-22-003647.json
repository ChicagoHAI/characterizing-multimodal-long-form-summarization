MGP's MD&A is presented in nine sections:\n\u2022Overview\n\u2022Recent Developments\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Distillery Products Segment\n\u2022Branded Spirits Segment\n\u2022Ingredient Solutions Segment\n\u2022Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity\n\u2022Critical Accounting Estimates\n\u2022New Accounting Pronouncements\nOVERVIEW\nMGP is a leading producer and supplier of premium distilled spirits, branded spirits and food ingredients. Distilled spirits include premium bourbon and rye whiskeys and GNS, including vodka and gin. Our distilled spirits are either packaged and sold under our own brands to distributors, sold directly or indirectly to manufacturers of other branded spirits, or direct to consumers. We are also a top producer of high quality industrial alcohol for use in both food and non-food applications. Our protein and starch food ingredients provide a host of functional, nutritional and sensory benefits for a wide range of food products to serve the consumer packaged goods industry. Our industrial alcohol and ingredients products are sold directly, or through distributors, to manufacturers and processors of finished packaged goods or to bakeries. The Company reports three operating segments; Distillery Products, Branded Spirits and Ingredient Solutions.\nOur strategic plan is designed to leverage our history and strengths as well as to leverage the positive macro trends we see in the industries where we compete while providing better insulation from outside factors, including swings in commodity pricing.\nDistillery Products Segment\nOur Distillery Products segment mission is to cultivate lasting partnerships with customers across all product categories by leveraging our strong sales and operating platform, aging whiskey inventory, and unique project development skills. The favorable macro trends benefiting our business include the expansion of the distilled spirits' share within beverage alcohol, particularly growth of the American whiskey category that has continued to expand over the past several years. This includes shifting sales mix to higher margin products, such as premium bourbon and rye whiskeys, as well as extending the product range of distilled gins and grain neutral spirits ( GNS\u201d), the base component for vodka. Our Distillery Products segment is also subject to unfavorable macro trends which include increased competition as industry participants seek to capitalize on consumer\ntrends. Our strategy within the Distillery Products segment is to continue migrating away from industrial alcohol to white beverage alcohol, cultivate additional multi-national and craft customers for brown goods sales, enhance offerings to become a beverage alcohol solution provider\u201d, develop an export market for our aged brown goods, and attract control label customers to boost overall brown goods growth.\nWe continued to focus on attracting and developing customers for our premium beverage alcohol products during 2021 as well as shifting our focus from industrial alcohol to white beverage alcohol. Distillery Products segment sales for 2021 increased 12.5 percent over the prior year.\nBranded Spirits Segment\nOur Branded Spirits segment mission is to align our product offering and enhance focus on growing spirits categories and price tiers. The favorable macro industry trends benefiting our business include growth in high-end whiskey and tequila brands as well as growth across all spirit categories in the high-end price tiers. Our Branded Spirits segment is also subject to unfavorable macro trends, which include increased competition as industry participants seek to capitalize on consumer trends. Our strategy for the Branded Spirits segment is to focus on the categories, brands, price points, bottle size and market support that will maximize profit for the Company.\nOn January 22, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Luxco, Inc. and its affiliates ( Luxco\u201d), and subsequently completed the merger on April 1, 2021 (the Merger\u201d). As a result of the Merger, we have increased our scale and market position in the branded-spirits sector and believe it has strengthened our platform for future growth of higher valued-added products. The Branded Spirits segment sales for 2021 increased 4,324.3 percent over the prior year.\nIngredient Solutions Segment\nOur Ingredient Solutions segment mission is to remain a strategic business partner of choice earning meaningful relationships through collaboration, innovation, and dedication to the best-in-class customer service. The favorable macro industry trends benefiting our business include growth and focus on high fiber, high protein, meat alternative, plant-based protein, and non-GMO Products. We continue to provide outstanding customer solutions, taking advantage of our position within growing consumer trends. Our strategy within the Ingredient Solutions segment is to expand our market share of specialty wheat starch and protein product lines, expand textured plant protein capabilities within specialty wheat proteins, maximize the value of clean label starches, and optimize our customer set, route to market, and channels to drive profitability. Ingredient Solutions segment sales for 2021 increased 16.1 percent over the prior year, primarily due to increased sales of specialty wheat starches and proteins, and commodity wheat starches.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nMerger with Luxco. On January 22, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Luxco, and subsequently completed the Merger on April 1, 2021. Luxco is a leading branded beverage alcohol company across various categories, with a more than 60-year business heritage. Following the Merger, Luxco became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MGP and is included in the Branded Spirits segment. (See Note 4, Business Combinations, for additional information).\nDryer Fire Incident. During November 2020, we experienced a fire at the Atchison facility. The fire damaged certain equipment in the facility's feed drying operations and caused temporary loss of production time. At December 31, 2021, we received a legally binding commitment from our insurance carrier for final settlement of $43,688, $27,363 was related to business interruption and $16,325 was for the damaged dryer. The business interruption portion of the settlement was recorded as a reduction of Cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income and the insurance recoveries for the replacement of the damaged dryer was recorded as Insurance recoveries on the Consolidated Statement of Income. We recorded a settlement related to the business interruption from our insurance carrier of $23,583 and $3,780 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our insurance provided coverage for business interruption and other losses from damage to property, plant and equipment, less deductibles. We completed the construction of the replacement dryer and placed the dryer into service during 2021.\nCOVID-19. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues and new variants are discovered, we are monitoring the guidance from federal, state and local public health authorities and will take the necessary actions to comply with the updated guidelines. The Company's business is part of the United States' critical infrastructure and thus is deemed to be an essential business.\u201d As such, we continue to take the necessary and appropriate actions designed to protect our workforce as it continues its critical operations. We have continued to operate without any significant negative impacts; however continued operations could be affected by voluntary or mandatory temporary closures of our facilities, interruptions to our supply chain or additional efforts to protect the health and safety of our employees. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant adverse affects to\nthe Company's operations, supply chain and customer demand due to COVID-19; however, we are monitoring the situation closely. See Risk Factors for additional discussion of the potential adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated results\nThe table below details the

The 7.7 percentage point increase was primarily due to the favorable tax impact of vested share-based awards that occurred during 2019.\nBasic and diluted EPS\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>EPS </td> <td> </td> <td>% Increase (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic and Diluted EPS for 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in operating income(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>pp(b)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in weighted average shares outstanding: share repurchase program(d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>0.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>pp </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in weighted average shares outstanding: withholding taxes(d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>0.01 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>pp </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax: Change in share-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.21) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.3) </td> <td> </td> <td>pp </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax: Change in effective tax rate </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.13) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.7) </td> <td> </td> <td>pp </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic and diluted EPS for 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in operating income(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>3.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>pp(b)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in income attributable to participating securities(c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>0.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>pp </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in interest expense (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(0.08) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4) </td> <td> </td> <td>pp </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in other income (expense), net(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(0.08) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4) </td> <td> </td> <td>pp </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in weighted average shares outstanding(d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(0.98) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41.4) </td> <td> </td> <td>pp </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax: Change in effective tax rate </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.10) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.2) </td> <td> </td> <td>pp </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in noncontrolling interest </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.03) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.3) </td> <td> </td> <td>pp </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic EPS for 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4.37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conversion feature of Convertible Senior Notes </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.03) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.3) </td> <td> </td> <td>pp </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted EPS for 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Items are net of tax based on the effective tax rate for each base year.\n(b)Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\n(c)Income attributable to participating securities changes primarily due to the awarding and vesting of the employee RSUs that receive dividend equivalent payments.\n(d)Weighted average shares outstanding change primarily due to our repurchases of Common Stock, the vesting of employee RSUs, our purchase of vested RSUs from employees to pay withholding taxes, and the granting of Common Stock to directors.

Sales of brown goods and white goods within premium beverage alcohol, fuel grade alcohol, and warehouse services increased, while sales of industrial alcohol and distillers feed and related co-products decreased compared to 2020. The increase in brown goods, white goods and fuel grade alcohol was driven by higher sales volume and higher average selling price. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of industrial alcohol, which was driven by lower sales volume due to the discontinuing of the ICP third party sales and marketing services, partially offset by higher average selling price. The decrease in sales of distillers feed and related co-products was due to lower average selling price, partially offset by higher sales volume, both of which resulted from the Dryer Fire Incident and the subsequent sale of wet rather than dry distillers grains (see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies for further details).\nGross profit increased year versus year by $38,333, or 50.6 percent. Gross margin for 2021 increased to 32.4 percent from 24.2 percent for 2020. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher sales volume on brown goods as well as higher average selling price on industrial, white goods and fuel grade alcohol. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by lower average selling price on distillers feed and related co-products and higher input costs of industrial alcohol, white goods and brown goods.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>DISTILLERY PRODUCTS SALES </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Year-versus-Year Sales Change Increase/ (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brown Goods </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>White Goods </td> <td>63,873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium beverage alcohol </td> <td>185,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>167,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Industrial alcohol </td> <td>80,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food grade alcohol </td> <td>265,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>246,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,049 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel grade alcohol </td> <td>5,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(319) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distillers feed and related co-products </td> <td>26,109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,743 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(634) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Warehouse services </td> <td>15,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,656 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>975 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Distillery Products </td> <td>$ </td> <td>313,309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>294,238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Change in Year-versus-Year Sales Attributed to: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Volume(b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Net Price/Mix(c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium beverage alcohol </td> <td>10.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.6)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Other Financial Information </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td>Year-versus-Year Increase/(Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,773 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin % </td> <td>24.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>pp(d)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Total sales change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales dollars and prior period sales dollars, divided by prior period sales dollars.\n(b) Volume change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales volume and prior period sales volume, multiplied by prior period sales per unit.\n(c) Price/Mix change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales-per-unit and prior period sales-per unit, multiplied by current period sales volume.\n(d) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\n2020 compared to 2019\nTotal Distillery Products sales for 2020 increased by $19,071, or 6.5 percent compared to 2019. Sales of brown goods and white goods within premium beverage alcohol, warehouse services, and industrial alcohol increased, while sales of distillers feed and related co-products and fuel grade alcohol decreased compared to 2019. The increase in brown goods was due to increased sales volume, partially offset by lower average selling price. The increase in white goods and industrial alcohol was due to higher average selling prices, partially offset by decreased sales volume. These increases were slightly offset by decreases in distillers feed and related co-products and fuel grade alcohol due to lower average selling prices.\nGross profit increased year versus year by $11,357, or 17.6 percent. Gross margin for 2020 increased to 24.2 percent compared to 21.9 percent for 2019. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher sales volume on brown goods and higher average selling price on white goods and industrial alcohol. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by higher costs relating to a reduction in brown goods put-away for aging, lower average selling price on brown goods and increased production costs due to the temporary shutdown of the Atchison facilities as a result of the ransomware cyber-attack.\nBRANDED SPIRITS SEGMENT\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>BRANDED SPIRITS SALES </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Year-versus-Year Sales Change Increase/ (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ultra Premium </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>802.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium </td> <td>19,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,787.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mid </td> <td>51,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Value </td> <td>58,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>19,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,176.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Branded Spirits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>183,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>179,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,324.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Change in Year-versus-Year Sales Attributed to: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Volume(b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Net Price/Mix(c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Branded Spirits </td> <td>4,324.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>29,320.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,996.1)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Other Financial Information </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td>Year-versus-Year Increase/(Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,764.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin % </td> <td>34.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>52.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.6) </td> <td> </td> <td>pp(d)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Total sales change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales dollars and prior period sales dollars, divided by prior period sales dollars.\n(b) Volume change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales volume and prior period sales volume, multiplied by prior period sales per unit.\n(c) Price/Mix change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales-per-unit and prior period sales-per unit, multiplied by current period sales volume.\n(d) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\n2021 compared to 2020\nTotal Branded Spirits sales for 2021 increased by $179,417, or 4,324.3 percent compared to 2020. Sales of value, mid, ultra premium, other and premium increased compared to 2020, primarily due to the additional brands acquired as part of the Merger.\nGross profit increased year versus year by $60,457, or 2764.4 percent. Gross margin for 2021 decreased to 34.1 percent compared to 52.7 percent for 2020. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the additional brands acquired as part of the Merger. The decrease in gross margin was due to sales price, as the vast majority of the Company's branded spirits sales pre-merger were in the ultra premium category. Gross profit was reduced during 2021, due to a required step up in value due to purchase accounting related to the Merger. Of the purchase accounting step up, $2,529 was associated with marking the finished goods inventory to fair value, which fully flowed through in the year and is not expected to recur in the future periods.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>BRANDED SPIRITS SALES </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Year-versus-Year Sales Change Increase/ (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ultra Premium </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium </td> <td>334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mid </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Value </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Branded Spirits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Change in Year-versus-Year Sales Attributed to: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Volume(b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Net Price/Mix(c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Branded Spirits </td> <td>38.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>49.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.2)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Other Financial Information </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td>Year-versus-Year Increase/(Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin % </td> <td>52.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>51.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>pp(d)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Total sales change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales dollars and prior period sales dollars, divided by prior period sales dollars.\n(b) Volume change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales volume and prior period sales volume, multiplied by prior period sales per unit.\n(c) Price/Mix change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales-per-unit and prior period sales-per unit, multiplied by current period sales volume.\n(d) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\n2020 compared to 2019\nTotal Branded Spirits sales for 2020 increased by $1,154, or 38.5 percent compared to 2019, primarily driven by an increase in ultra premium. The increase in ultra premium sales was due to expanding into more markets and increasing points of distribution, as well as additional brands acquired during 2020.\nGross profit increased year versus year by $651, or 42.4 percent. Gross margin for 2020 increased to 52.7 percent compared to 51.3 percent for 2019. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased sales of branded spirits and additional brands acquired during 2020.\nINGREDIENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT Table 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>INGREDIENT SOLUTIONS SALES </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Year-versus-Year Sales Change Increase/ (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty wheat starches </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty wheat proteins </td> <td>31,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,960 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commodity wheat starches </td> <td>10,014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commodity wheat proteins </td> <td>1,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(449) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Ingredient Solutions </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,063 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Change in Year-versus-Year Sales Attributed to: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Volume(b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Net Price/Mix(c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Ingredient Solutions </td> <td>16.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Other Financial Information </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Year-versus-year Increase/(Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,846 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin % </td> <td>24.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.2) </td> <td> </td> <td>pp(d)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Total sales change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales dollars and prior period sales dollars, divided by prior period sales dollars.\n(b) Volume change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales volume and prior period sales volume, multiplied by prior period sales per unit.\n(c) Price/Mix change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales-per-unit and prior period sales-per unit, multiplied by current period sales volume.\n(d) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\n2021 compared to 2020\nTotal Ingredient Solutions sales for 2021 increased by $12,587, or 16.1 percent compared to 2020. Sales of specialty wheat starches and proteins and commodity wheat starches increased, while sales of commodity wheat proteins decreased. The increase in specialty wheat starches was primarily due to higher sales volume. The increase in specialty wheat proteins was primarily due to higher sales volume and higher average selling prices. The increase in commodity wheat starches was due to higher sales volume.\nGross profit increased year versus year by $1,369, or 6.6 percent. Gross margin for 2021 decreased to 24.5 percent from 26.7 percent for 2020. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by higher sales volume of specialty wheat starches and commodity wheat starches, as well as higher sales volume and higher average selling prices of specialty wheat proteins. These increases were partially offset by higher input costs.\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>INGREDIENT SOLUTIONS SALES </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Year-versus-Year Sales Change Increase/ (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty wheat starches </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty wheat proteins </td> <td>26,960 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commodity wheat starches </td> <td>7,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,998) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commodity wheat proteins </td> <td>1,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(867) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Ingredient Solutions </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,063 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Change in Year-versus-Year Sales Attributed to: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Volume(b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Net Price/Mix(c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Ingredient Solutions </td> <td>19.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Other Financial Information </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Year-versus-year Increase/(Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,846 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,580 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin % </td> <td>26.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>16.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>pp(d)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Total sales change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales dollars and prior period sales dollars, divided by prior period sales dollars.\n(b) Volume change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales volume and prior period sales volume, multiplied by prior period sales per unit.\n(c) Price/Mix change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales-per-unit and prior period sales-per unit, multiplied by current period sales volume.\n(d) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\n2020 compared to 2019\nTotal Ingredient Solutions sales for 2020 increased by $12,551, or 19.2 percent compared to 2019. This increase was driven by higher sales of specialty wheat starches and proteins, partially offset by a decrease in sales of commodity wheat starches and proteins. The increase in sales of specialty wheat starches was driven by increased sales volume and higher average selling prices. The increase in sales of specialty wheat proteins was driven by increased sales volume, partially offset by lower average selling prices. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales volume of commodity wheat starches and proteins.\nGross profit increased year versus year by $10,266, or 97.0 percent. Gross margin for 2020 increased to 26.7 percent from 16.2 percent for 2019. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by the increased sales volume and higher average selling prices of specialty wheat starches and proteins and decreased sales volume of commodity wheat starches and proteins (mix). Additionally, gross profit was positively impacted by the optimization of higher margin specialty products to meet the increased demand of customers' high fiber and high protein products. These increases in gross profit were partially offset by increased production costs due to the temporary shutdown of the Atchison facilities as a result of the ransomware cyber-attack.\nCASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate adequate cash from operations while having ready access to capital at competitive rates.\nOperating cash flow and borrowings through our Credit Agreement, Convertible Senior Notes and Note Purchase Agreement (Note 6, Corporate Borrowings) provide the primary sources of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. These same sources of cash are used to fund shareholder dividends and other discretionary uses. Our overall liquidity reflects our strong business results and an effective cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors, and tax considerations. We expect our sources of cash to be adequate to provide for budgeted capital expenditures, potential merger or acquisitions, and anticipated operating requirements for the foreseeable future.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flow Summary </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Changes, Year versus Year-Increase / (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,255 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,722 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,533 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(182,619) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,647) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,931) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(162,972) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,716) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in) financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>94,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,255) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,507) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109,542 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,748) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>(25) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(94) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,716) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18,447) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,069 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities were $88,263 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The cash provided by operating activities during 2021 resulted primarily from net income of $90,817, adjustments for non-cash or non-operating charges of $16,850 including depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, share-based compensation, and partially offset by a gain on insurance recoveries, and by uses of cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $19,404. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were $14,214 use of cash related to an increase in inventories, primarily barrel distillate, $6,242 use of cash related to income taxes refundable, and $6,031 use of cash related to an increase in receivables, inclusive of insurance receivables, partially offset by $5,301 of cash provided by an increase in accounts payable related to the timing of cash disbursements.\nCash provided by operating activities were $53,255 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The cash provided by operating activities during 2020 resulted primarily from net income of $40,345, adjustments for non-cash or non-operating charges of $17,050 including depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, and deferred income taxes, partially offset by uses of cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $4,140. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were $16,173 use of cash related to an increase in receivables, inclusive of insurance receivables, $3,886 use of cash related to an increase in inventories, partially offset by $11,503 provided by cash related to an increase in accrued expenses primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and $1,817 provided by cash related to an increase in accounts payable related to the timing of cash disbursements. Additionally, there was $1,750 provided by cash related to income taxes payable, due to higher than expected income before taxes.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2021 was $182,619, which primarily resulted from $149,005 related to the Merger with Luxco and additions to property, plant and equipment of $47,389 (see capital spending), partially offset by cash proceeds of $16,325 from property insurance recoveries.\nCash used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2020 was $19,647, which primarily resulted from additions to property, plant and equipment of $19,701 (see capital spending) and an increase in proceeds from sale of property of $2,906, partially offset by cash of $2,750 used in the acquisition of a business.\nCapital Spending. We manage capital spending to support our business growth plans. We have incurred $51,691, $18,646, and $18,771 of capital expenditures and have paid $47,389, $19,701, and $16,730 for capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The difference between the amount of capital expenditures incurred and amount paid is due to the change in capital expenditures in accounts payable. The increase in capital expenditures for 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to the replacement of the feed dryer system. We expect approximately $37,200, in capital expenditures for 2022 which will be used for facility improvement and expansion, facility sustenance projects and environmental health and safety projects.\nFinancing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2021 was $94,287, primarily due to net debt proceeds of $192,580 (see Long-Term and Short-Term Debt), primarily resulting from the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, partially offset by $87,509 payment on assumed debt as part of the Merger, and payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of $10,017 (see Note 8, Equity and EPS for additional information),\nCash used in financing activities for year ended December 31, 2020 was $15,255, primarily due to payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of $8,188 (see Note 8, Equity and EPS for additional information), purchases of treasury stock of $4,411 (see Treasury Purchases), offset by net proceeds from debt of $2,656 (see Long-Term and Short-Term Debt).\nTreasury Purchases. 38,079 RSUs vested and converted to common shares during year ended December 31, 2021, of which we withheld and purchased for treasury 11,887 shares valued at $767 to cover payment of associated withholding taxes.\n31,741 RSUs vested and converted to common shares during year ended December 31, 2020, of which we withheld and purchased for treasury 10,437 shares valued at $358 to cover payment of associated withholding taxes.\nShare Repurchase. On February 25, 2019, the Board of Directors approved a $25,000 share repurchase authorization commencing February 27, 2019 through February 27, 2022. Under the share repurchase program, the company can repurchase stock from time to time for cash in open market purchases, block transactions, and privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. This share repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or terminated by the Company at any time without prior notice. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not repurchase any shares of MGP Common Stock and have $20,947 remaining under the share repurchase plan. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased approximately 159,104 shares of MGP Common Stock for $4,053.\nLong-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including brand development, share repurchases, and Board-approved dividends) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $233,399 (net of unamortized loan fees of $6,454) at December 31, 2021 and $39,871 (net of unamortized loan fees of $129) at December 31, 2020. During 2021, we had net borrowings on our Convertible Senior Notes of $201,250, and during 2020, we had net payments on our Credit Agreement of $300. Additionally, during 2021 and 2020, we had net payments on our long-term debt of $1,620, and $1,208, respectively. During 2021 and 2020, we incurred $7,050 and $1,148, respectively, of loan fees associated with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes and refinancing our credit agreement. Net borrowings / (payments) on all debt for 2021 and 2020 were $192,580, and $(2,656), respectively (see Note 6, Corporate borrowings for additional information).\nDividends and Dividend Equivalents. See Note 8, Equity and EPS for further discussion.\nOn February 22, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend payable to stockholders of record as of March 11, 2022, of our Common Stock and a dividend equivalent payable to holders of certain RSUs as of March 11, 2022, of $0.12 per share and per unit. The dividend payment and dividend equivalent payment will occur on March 25, 2022.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nOur principal uses of cash in the ordinary course of business are for input costs used in our production processes, salaries, capital expenditures, and investments supporting our strategic plan, such as the aging of barreled distillate and potential merger and acquisitions. Generally, during periods when commodity prices are rising, our operations require increased use of cash to support inventory levels.\nOur principal sources of cash are product sales and borrowing on our Credit Agreement, Convertible Senior Notes and Note Purchase Agreement. Under these agreements, we must meet certain financial covenants and restrictions, and at December 31, 2021, we met those covenants and restrictions.\nAt December 31, 2021, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by $278,298, largely due to our inventories, at cost, of $245,944. At December 31, 2021, our cash balance was $21,568 and we have used our Credit Agreement, Convertible Senior Notes and Note Purchase Agreement for liquidity purposes, with $400,000 remaining for additional borrowings. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We regularly assess our cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. We utilize short-term and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as capital investments and dividend payments. In addition, we have strong operating results such that financial institutions should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements, if needed.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table provides information on the amounts and payments of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2021: Table 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Short-Term (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Long-Term </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt </td> <td>$ </td> <td>239,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236,626 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt </td> <td>81,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,757 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases </td> <td>10,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,032 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,165 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments </td> <td>199,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>159,874 </td> <td> </td> <td>(b) </td> <td>39,245 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>1,118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>886 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>532,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>171,567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>360,679 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Short-term obligation payments are due within 12 months from the current year end.\n(b) Includes open purchase order commitments related to raw materials and packaging used in the ordinary course of business of $148,349.\nIndustrial Revenue Bonds\nWe are in various stages of financing projects with industrial revenue bond transactions for our facilities located in Kentucky. The bonds allow a 30 year real property tax abatement on our renovated and newly-constructed warehouse buildings and distilleries in Kentucky. We have been approved for $25,000 of industrial revenue bonds with the City of Williamstown Kentucky, and have used approximately $11,000. Additionally, we have been approved for $50,000 of industrial revenue bonds with Nelson County Kentucky and have used approximately $33,000. The City of Williamstown and Nelson County issued the industrial revenue bonds to us and then used the proceeds to purchase the land and warehouse from us. The city then leased the facilities back to us under a capital lease, the terms of which provide for the payment of basic rent in an amount sufficient to pay principal and interest on the bonds. Our obligation to pay rent under the lease is in the same amount and due on the same date as the city's obligation to pay debt service on the bonds which we hold. The lease permits us to present the bonds at any time for cancellation, upon which our obligation to pay basic rent would be canceled. At the bonds' maturity the facilities will revert to us without costs. If we were to present the bonds for cancellation prior to maturity, a nominal fee would be incurred.\nWe recorded the land and buildings as assets in property, plant, and equipment, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Because we own all outstanding bonds, have a legal right to set-off, and intend to set-off the corresponding lease and interest payment, we have netted the capital lease obligation with the bond asset. No amount for our obligation under the capital lease is reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, nor do we reflect an amount for the corresponding industrial revenue bond asset (see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information).\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The application of certain of these policies places demands on management's judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain, inclusive of effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop as forecast, and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment. We have identified the most critical accounting policies which involve the most complex and subjective judgments. These should be read in conjunction with the significant accounting policies discussed in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nBusiness Combinations. The merger with Luxco was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d), and as such, we allocated the consideration paid for a business to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, with the excess recorded to goodwill. The fair value measurements of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Critical estimates used in determining the fair value include, but are not limited to discount rates that would be used by a market participant in valuing these assets and liabilities, forecasted revenue growth rates, including the terminal growth rates, projected cash flows, distributor attrition rates, royalty rates and market comparable, among others. The fair value of personal property assets was determined using the market approach and the indirect and direct method of the cost approach, and the fair value of real property was determined using the cost approach and the sales comparison approach. The fair value of work-in-process and finished goods inventory was determined using the comparative sales method and raw materials was determined using the replacement cost method. The trade names and distributor relationships acquired were adjusted to fair value using the relief from royalty method and multi-period excess earnings method, respectively. Management engaged a third party valuation specialist to assist in the valuation analysis of certain acquired assets including trade name and distributor relationship.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis if events and circumstances occur that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value. We have the option to evaluate qualitative factors to assess if goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired before quantifying the fair value of the reporting unit. Management judgment is required in the evaluation of qualitative factors, determination of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. To the extent that the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized and allocated to the reporting units. Based on the impairment tests performed by the Company during the fourth quarter 2021, we believe none of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired and are not currently at risk of impairment.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.", "item_7_truncated": "Total Ingredient Solutions sales for 2020 increased by $12,551, or 19.2 percent compared to 2019. This increase was driven by higher sales of specialty wheat starches and proteins, partially offset by a decrease in sales of commodity wheat starches and proteins. The increase in sales of specialty wheat starches was driven by increased sales volume and higher average selling prices. The increase in sales of specialty wheat proteins was driven by increased sales volume, partially offset by lower average selling prices. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales volume of commodity wheat starches and proteins.\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

We have the option to evaluate qualitative factors to assess if goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired before quantifying the fair value of the reporting unit. Management judgment is required in the evaluation of qualitative factors, determination of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. To the extent that the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized and allocated to the reporting units.

The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased sales of branded spirits and additional brands acquired during 2020.\nDiluted EPS increased to $4.34 in 2021 from $2.37 in 2020, primarily due the above described changes in Basic EPS, partially offset by the conversion feature of the Convertible Senior Notes.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>BRANDED SPIRITS SALES </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Year-versus-Year Sales Change Increase/ (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ultra Premium </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>802.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium </td> <td>19,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,787.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mid </td> <td>51,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Value </td> <td>58,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>19,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,176.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Branded Spirits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>183,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>179,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,324.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Change in Year-versus-Year Sales Attributed to: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Volume(b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Net Price/Mix(c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Branded Spirits </td> <td>4,324.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>29,320.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,996.1)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Other Financial Information </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td>Year-versus-Year Increase/(Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,764.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin % </td> <td>34.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>52.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.6) </td> <td> </td> <td>pp(d)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2020 to 2019 - Operating income for 2020 increased to $54,241 from $47,242 for 2019, due to increases in gross profit in our Distillery Products, Ingredient Solutions and Branded Spirits segments. These increases were partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses.\n2020 to 2019 - Gross profit for 2020 was $98,806, an increase of 29.1 percent compared to 2019. The increase was driven by an increase in gross profit in the Distillery Products, Ingredient Solutions and Branded Spirits segments. The Distillery Products segment gross profit increased by $11,357, or 17.6 percent, the Ingredient Solutions segment gross profit increased by $10,266, or 97.0 percent, and the Branded Spirits Segment increased by $651, or 42.4 percent.\n(c) Price/Mix change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales-per-unit and prior period sales-per unit, multiplied by current period sales volume.\n(c) Price/Mix change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales-per-unit and prior period sales-per unit, multiplied by current period sales volume.\nDividends and Dividend Equivalents. See Note 8, Equity and EPS for further discussion.\nContractual Obligations\n\u2022New Accounting Pronouncements\n\n2021 compared to 2020\ntrends. Our strategy within the Distillery Products segment is to continue migrating away from industrial alcohol to white beverage alcohol, cultivate additional multi-national and craft customers for brown goods sales, enhance offerings to become a beverage alcohol solution provider\u201d, develop an export market for our aged brown goods, and attract control label customers to boost overall brown goods growth.\n(a) See segment discussion.\nCASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n(d) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\nCapital Spending. We manage capital spending to support our business growth plans. We have incurred $51,691, $18,646, and $18,771 of capital expenditures and have paid $47,389, $19,701, and $16,730 for capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The difference between the amount of capital expenditures incurred and amount paid is due to the change in capital expenditures in accounts payable. The increase in capital expenditures for 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to the replacement of the feed dryer system. We expect approximately $37,200, in capital expenditures for 2022 which will be used for facility improvement and expansion, facility sustenance projects and environmental health and safety projects.\nTotal Branded Spirits sales for 2020 increased by $1,154, or 38.5 percent compared to 2019, primarily driven by an increase in ultra premium. The increase in ultra premium sales was due to expanding into more markets and increasing points of distribution, as well as additional brands acquired during 2020.\nTotal Ingredient Solutions sales for 2021 increased by $12,587, or 16.1 percent compared to 2020. Sales of specialty wheat starches and proteins and commodity wheat starches increased, while sales of commodity wheat proteins decreased. The increase in specialty wheat starches was primarily due to higher sales volume. The increase in specialty wheat proteins was primarily due to higher sales volume and higher average selling prices. The increase in commodity wheat starches was due to higher sales volume.\n2021 to 2020 - Gain on Insurance recoveries for 2021 was $16,325. During November 2020, we experienced a fire at the Atchison facility. The fire damaged certain equipment in the facility's feed drying operations and caused a temporary loss of production time. At December 31, 2021, we received a legally binding commitment from our insurance carrier for final settlement for the replacement of the damaged dryer which resulted in a gain of $16,325.\nDISTILLERY PRODUCTS SEGMENT\nOVERVIEW\nLong-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including brand development, share repurchases, and Board-approved dividends) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $233,399 (net of unamortized loan fees of $6,454) at December 31, 2021 and $39,871 (net of unamortized loan fees of $129) at December 31, 2020. During 2021, we had net borrowings on our Convertible Senior Notes of $201,250, and during 2020, we had net payments on our Credit Agreement of $300. Additionally, during 2021 and 2020, we had net payments on our long-term debt of $1,620, and $1,208, respectively. During 2021 and 2020, we incurred $7,050 and $1,148, respectively, of loan fees associated with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes and refinancing our credit agreement. Net borrowings / (payments) on all debt for 2021 and 2020 were $192,580, and $(2,656), respectively (see Note 6, Corporate borrowings for additional information).\nDryer Fire Incident. During November 2020, we experienced a fire at the Atchison facility. The fire damaged certain equipment in the facility's feed drying operations and caused temporary loss of production time. At December 31, 2021, we received a legally binding commitment from our insurance carrier for final settlement of $43,688, $27,363 was related to business interruption and $16,325 was for the damaged dryer. The business interruption portion of the settlement was recorded as a reduction of Cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income and the insurance recoveries for the replacement of the damaged dryer was recorded as Insurance recoveries on the Consolidated Statement of Income. We recorded a settlement related to the business interruption from our insurance carrier of $23,583 and $3,780 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our insurance provided coverage for business interruption and other losses from damage to property, plant and equipment, less deductibles. We completed the construction of the replacement dryer and placed the dryer into service during 2021.\nThe following table provides information on the amounts and payments of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2021: \nSales\n(d) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\nDistillery Products Segment\n2021 to 2020 - Advertising and promotion expenses for 2021 were $16,098, an increase of 493.6 percent compared to 2020. The increase in Advertising and promotion expenses were primarily driven by the assumption of Luxco's advertising and promotion expenses during 2021.\nBusiness Combinations. The merger with Luxco was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d), and as such, we allocated the consideration paid for a business to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, with the excess recorded to goodwill. The fair value measurements of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Critical estimates used in determining the fair value include, but are not limited to discount rates that would be used by a market participant in valuing these assets and liabilities, forecasted revenue growth rates, including the terminal growth rates, projected cash flows, distributor attrition rates, royalty rates and market comparable, among others. The fair value of personal property assets was determined using the market approach and the indirect and direct method of the cost approach, and the fair value of real property was determined using the cost approach and the sales comparison approach. The fair value of work-in-process and finished goods inventory was determined using the comparative sales method and raw materials was determined using the replacement cost method. The trade names and distributor relationships acquired were adjusted to fair value using the relief from royalty method and multi-period excess earnings method, respectively. Management engaged a third party valuation specialist to assist in the valuation analysis of certain acquired assets including trade name and distributor relationship.\n\u2022Overview\n2021 compared to 2020\n2020 compared to 2019\nShare Repurchase. On February 25, 2019, the Board of Directors approved a $25,000 share repurchase authorization commencing February 27, 2019 through February 27, 2022. Under the share repurchase program, the company can repurchase stock from time to time for cash in open market purchases, block transactions, and privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. This share repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or terminated by the Company at any time without prior notice. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not repurchase any shares of MGP Common Stock and have $20,947 remaining under the share repurchase plan. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased approximately 159,104 shares of MGP Common Stock for $4,053.\nGross profit increased year versus year by $10,266, or 97.0 percent. Gross margin for 2020 increased to 26.7 percent from 16.2 percent for 2019. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by the increased sales volume and higher average selling prices of specialty wheat starches and proteins and decreased sales volume of commodity wheat starches and proteins (mix). Additionally, gross profit was positively impacted by the optimization of higher margin specialty products to meet the increased demand of customers' high fiber and high protein products. These increases in gross profit were partially offset by increased production costs due to the temporary shutdown of the Atchison facilities as a result of the ransomware cyber-attack.\nMerger with Luxco. On January 22, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Luxco, and subsequently completed the Merger on April 1, 2021. Luxco is a leading branded beverage alcohol company across various categories, with a more than 60-year business heritage. Following the Merger, Luxco became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MGP and is included in the Branded Spirits segment. (See Note 4, Business Combinations, for additional information).\nWe continued to focus on attracting and developing customers for our premium beverage alcohol products during 2021 as well as shifting our focus from industrial alcohol to white beverage alcohol. Distillery Products segment sales for 2021 increased 12.5 percent over the prior year.\nOur principal sources of cash are product sales and borrowing on our Credit Agreement, Convertible Senior Notes and Note Purchase Agreement. Under these agreements, we must meet certain financial covenants and restrictions, and at December 31, 2021, we met those covenants and restrictions.\n\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nMGP is a leading producer and supplier of premium distilled spirits, branded spirits and food ingredients. Distilled spirits include premium bourbon and rye whiskeys and GNS, including vodka and gin. Our distilled spirits are either packaged and sold under our own brands to distributors, sold directly or indirectly to manufacturers of other branded spirits, or direct to consumers. We are also a top producer of high quality industrial alcohol for use in both food and non-food applications. Our protein and starch food ingredients provide a host of functional, nutritional and sensory benefits for a wide range of food products to serve the consumer packaged goods industry. Our industrial alcohol and ingredients products are sold directly, or through distributors, to manufacturers and processors of finished packaged goods or to bakeries. The Company reports three operating segments; Distillery Products, Branded Spirits and Ingredient Solutions.\nWe are in various stages of financing projects with industrial revenue bond transactions for our facilities located in Kentucky. The bonds allow a 30 year real property tax abatement on our renovated and newly-constructed warehouse buildings and distilleries in Kentucky. We have been approved for $25,000 of industrial revenue bonds with the City of Williamstown Kentucky, and have used approximately $11,000. Additionally, we have been approved for $50,000 of industrial revenue bonds with Nelson County Kentucky and have used approximately $33,000. The City of Williamstown and Nelson County issued the industrial revenue bonds to us and then used the proceeds to purchase the land and warehouse from us. The city then leased the facilities back to us under a capital lease, the terms of which provide for the payment of basic rent in an amount sufficient to pay principal and interest on the bonds. Our obligation to pay rent under the lease is in the same amount and due on the same date as the city's obligation to pay debt service on the bonds which we hold. The lease permits us to present the bonds at any time for cancellation, upon which our obligation to pay basic rent would be canceled. At the bonds' maturity the facilities will revert to us without costs. If we were to present the bonds for cancellation prior to maturity, a nominal fee would be incurred.\n2021 to 2020 - Gross profit for 2021 was $198,965, an increase of 101.4 percent compared to 2020. The increase was driven by an increase in gross profit in Branded Spirits, Distillery Products and Ingredient Solutions segments. The Branded Spirits segment gross profit increased by $60,457 or 2,764.4 percent. The Distillery Products segment gross profit increased by $38,333, or 50.6 percent and the Ingredient Solutions segment gross profit increased by $1,369, or 6.6 percent.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A\u201d) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to provide a reader of MGP's consolidated financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. MGP's MD&A is presented in nine sections:\nOur Branded Spirits segment mission is to align our product offering and enhance focus on growing spirits categories and price tiers. The favorable macro industry trends benefiting our business include growth in high-end whiskey and tequila brands as well as growth across all spirit categories in the high-end price tiers. Our Branded Spirits segment is also subject to unfavorable macro trends, which include increased competition as industry participants seek to capitalize on consumer trends. Our strategy for the Branded Spirits segment is to focus on the categories, brands, price points, bottle size and market support that will maximize profit for the Company.\n\u2022Ingredient Solutions Segment\n\u2022Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nAdvertising and promotion expenses\n\n\u2022Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Report on Form 10-K contains forward looking statements as well as historical information.

Within the Distillery Solutions segment, sales were up 6.5 percent primarily due to an increase in sales of brown goods and white goods within premium beverage alcohol, warehouse services, and industrial alcohol. Total Ingredient Solutions segment sales increased 19.2 percent due to increased sales of specialty wheat starches and proteins. Within the Branded Spirits segment, sales were up 38.5 percent due to an increase in sales within the ultra premium category.\nCOVID-19. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues and new variants are discovered, we are monitoring the guidance from federal, state and local public health authorities and will take the necessary actions to comply with the updated guidelines. The Company's business is part of the United States' critical infrastructure and thus is deemed to be an essential business.\u201d As such, we continue to take the necessary and appropriate actions designed to protect our workforce as it continues its critical operations.

See Risk Factors for additional discussion of the potential adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nINGREDIENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT \n2021 to 2020 - Operating income for 2021 increased to $126,363 from $54,241 for 2020, due to increases in gross profit in the Branded Spirits, Distillery Products and Ingredient Solutions segments as well as the increase from the insurance recovery. These increases were partially offset by increases in SG&A expenses and Advertising and promotion expenses.\nBasic and diluted EPS\nGross profit increased year versus year by $1,369, or 6.6 percent. Gross margin for 2021 decreased to 24.5 percent from 26.7 percent for 2020. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by higher sales volume of specialty wheat starches and commodity wheat starches, as well as higher sales volume and higher average selling prices of specialty wheat proteins. These increases were partially offset by higher input costs.\nTotal Distillery Products sales for 2021 increased by $39,195, or 12.5 percent compared to 2020. Sales of brown goods and white goods within premium beverage alcohol, fuel grade alcohol, and warehouse services increased, while sales of industrial alcohol and distillers feed and related co-products decreased compared to 2020. The increase in brown goods, white goods and fuel grade alcohol was driven by higher sales volume and higher average selling price. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of industrial alcohol, which was driven by lower sales volume due to the discontinuing of the ICP third party sales and marketing services, partially offset by higher average selling price. The decrease in sales of distillers feed and related co-products was due to lower average selling price, partially offset by higher sales volume, both of which resulted from the Dryer Fire Incident and the subsequent sale of wet rather than dry distillers grains (see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies for further details).\n2020 to 2019 - Basic and Diluted EPS increased to $2.37 in 2020 from $2.27 in 2019, primarily due to the increase in Operating income, partially offset by the favorable tax impact of vested share-based awards that occurred during 2019.\n2021 to 2020 - Income tax expense for 2021 was $30,279, for an effective tax rate for the year of 25.0 percent. Income tax expense for 2020 was $12,256, for an effective tax rate for the year of 23.3 percent. The 1.7 percentage point increase was primarily due to higher Income before income taxes, and its dilutive effect on favorable tax credits and deductions as it concerns our effective tax rate.\nTotal Distillery Products sales for 2020 increased by $19,071, or 6.5 percent compared to 2019. Sales of brown goods and white goods within premium beverage alcohol, warehouse services, and industrial alcohol increased, while sales of distillers feed and related co-products and fuel grade alcohol decreased compared to 2019. The increase in brown goods was due to increased sales volume, partially offset by lower average selling price. The increase in white goods and industrial alcohol was due to higher average selling prices, partially offset by decreased sales volume. These increases were slightly offset by decreases in distillers feed and related co-products and fuel grade alcohol due to lower average selling prices.\n(d) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\n(a) Total sales change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales dollars and prior period sales dollars, divided by prior period sales dollars.\n(a) Total sales change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales dollars and prior period sales dollars, divided by prior period sales dollars.\n(b) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\n2020 to 2019 - Advertising and promotion expenses for 2020 were $2,712, a decrease of 4.1 percent compared to 2019. The decrease in Advertising and promotion expenses were driven by a decrease in corporate communications expenses.\n(d) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\nOur Ingredient Solutions segment mission is to remain a strategic business partner of choice earning meaningful relationships through collaboration, innovation, and dedication to the best-in-class customer service. The favorable macro industry trends benefiting our business include growth and focus on high fiber, high protein, meat alternative, plant-based protein, and non-GMO Products. We continue to provide outstanding customer solutions, taking advantage of our position within growing consumer trends. Our strategy within the Ingredient Solutions segment is to expand our market share of specialty wheat starch and protein product lines, expand textured plant protein capabilities within specialty wheat proteins, maximize the value of clean label starches, and optimize our customer set, route to market, and channels to drive profitability. Ingredient Solutions segment sales for 2021 increased 16.1 percent over the prior year, primarily due to increased sales of specialty wheat starches and proteins, and commodity wheat starches.\nThe table below details the consolidated results for 2021, 2020 and 2019: \nSG&A expenses\nAt December 31, 2021, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by $278,298, largely due to our inventories, at cost, of $245,944. At December 31, 2021, our cash balance was $21,568 and we have used our Credit Agreement, Convertible Senior Notes and Note Purchase Agreement for liquidity purposes, with $400,000 remaining for additional borrowings. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We regularly assess our cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. We utilize short-term and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as capital investments and dividend payments. In addition, we have strong operating results such that financial institutions should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements, if needed.\n(c) Price/Mix change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales-per-unit and prior period sales-per unit, multiplied by current period sales volume.\nOn January 22, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Luxco, Inc. and its affiliates ( Luxco\u201d), and subsequently completed the merger on April 1, 2021 (the Merger\u201d). As a result of the Merger, we have increased our scale and market position in the branded-spirits sector and believe it has strengthened our platform for future growth of higher valued-added products. The Branded Spirits segment sales for 2021 increased 4,324.3 percent over the prior year.\n\n\u2022Recent Developments\nOperating cash flow and borrowings through our Credit Agreement, Convertible Senior Notes and Note Purchase Agreement (Note 6, Corporate Borrowings) provide the primary sources of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. These same sources of cash are used to fund shareholder dividends and other discretionary uses. Our overall liquidity reflects our strong business results and an effective cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors, and tax considerations. We expect our sources of cash to be adequate to provide for budgeted capital expenditures, potential merger or acquisitions, and anticipated operating requirements for the foreseeable future.\n31,741 RSUs vested and converted to common shares during year ended December 31, 2020, of which we withheld and purchased for treasury 10,437 shares valued at $358 to cover payment of associated withholding taxes.\n\u2022Branded Spirits Segment\n2021 to 2020 - Sales for 2021 were $626,720, an increase of 58.5 percent compared to 2020, which was the result of increased sales in the Branded Spirits, Distillery Products and Ingredient Solutions segments. Total Branded Spirits segment sales increased 4,324.3 percent, due to the additional brands acquired as part of the Merger. Within the Distillery Products segment, sales were up 12.5 percent primarily due to an increase in sales of brown goods within premium beverage alcohol. Total Ingredient Solutions segment sales increased 16.1 percent primarily due to increased sales of specialty wheat starches and proteins.\nGross profit increased year versus year by $11,357, or 17.6 percent. Gross margin for 2020 increased to 24.2 percent compared to 21.9 percent for 2019. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher sales volume on brown goods and higher average selling price on white goods and industrial alcohol. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by higher costs relating to a reduction in brown goods put-away for aging, lower average selling price on brown goods and increased production costs due to the temporary shutdown of the Atchison facilities as a result of the ransomware cyber-attack.\nCash used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2020 was $19,647, which primarily resulted from additions to property, plant and equipment of $19,701 (see capital spending) and an increase in proceeds from sale of property of $2,906, partially offset by cash of $2,750 used in the acquisition of a business.\nOur principal uses of cash in the ordinary course of business are for input costs used in our production processes, salaries, capital expenditures, and investments supporting our strategic plan, such as the aging of barreled distillate and potential merger and acquisitions. Generally, during periods when commodity prices are rising, our operations require increased use of cash to support inventory levels.\nOperating income \nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities were $88,263 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The cash provided by operating activities during 2021 resulted primarily from net income of $90,817, adjustments for non-cash or non-operating charges of $16,850 including depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, share-based compensation, and partially offset by a gain on insurance recoveries, and by uses of cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $19,404. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were $14,214 use of cash related to an increase in inventories, primarily barrel distillate, $6,242 use of cash related to income taxes refundable, and $6,031 use of cash related to an increase in receivables, inclusive of insurance receivables, partially offset by $5,301 of cash provided by an increase in accounts payable related to the timing of cash disbursements.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(b)Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\n2021 to 2020 - Basic EPS increased to $4.37 in 2021 from $2.37 in 2020, primarily due to the increase in Operating income, partially offset by an increase in shares outstanding as a result of shares issued as part of the consideration paid for the Merger.\n2020 to 2019 - Income tax expense for 2020 was $12,256, for an effective tax rate for the year of 23.3 percent. Income tax expense for 2019 was $7,144, for an effective tax rate for the year of 15.6 percent. The 7.7 percentage point increase was primarily due to the favorable tax impact of vested share-based awards that occurred during 2019.\n(a) Total sales change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales dollars and prior period sales dollars, divided by prior period sales dollars.\nWe recorded the land and buildings as assets in property, plant, and equipment, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Because we own all outstanding bonds, have a legal right to set-off, and intend to set-off the corresponding lease and interest payment, we have netted the capital lease obligation with the bond asset. No amount for our obligation under the capital lease is reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, nor do we reflect an amount for the corresponding industrial revenue bond asset (see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information).\nBranded Spirits Segment\nOur Distillery Products segment mission is to cultivate lasting partnerships with customers across all product categories by leveraging our strong sales and operating platform, aging whiskey inventory, and unique project development skills. The favorable macro trends benefiting our business include the expansion of the distilled spirits' share within beverage alcohol, particularly growth of the American whiskey category that has continued to expand over the past several years. This includes shifting sales mix to higher margin products, such as premium bourbon and rye whiskeys, as well as extending the product range of distilled gins and grain neutral spirits ( GNS\u201d), the base component for vodka. Our Distillery Products segment is also subject to unfavorable macro trends which include increased competition as industry participants seek to capitalize on consumer\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The application of certain of these policies places demands on management's judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain, inclusive of effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop as forecast, and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment. We have identified the most critical accounting policies which involve the most complex and subjective judgments. These should be read in conjunction with the significant accounting policies discussed in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\n(c) Price/Mix change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales-per-unit and prior period sales-per unit, multiplied by current period sales volume.\n(b) Includes open purchase order commitments related to raw materials and packaging used in the ordinary course of business of $148,349.\nFinancing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2021 was $94,287, primarily due to net debt proceeds of $192,580 (see Long-Term and Short-Term Debt), primarily resulting from the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, partially offset by $87,509 payment on assumed debt as part of the Merger, and payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of $10,017 (see Note 8, Equity and EPS for additional information),\nGross profit\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2021 was $182,619, which primarily resulted from $149,005 related to the Merger with Luxco and additions to property, plant and equipment of $47,389 (see capital spending), partially offset by cash proceeds of $16,325 from property insurance recoveries.\nBRANDED SPIRITS SEGMENT\nGross profit increased year versus year by $60,457, or 2764.4 percent. Gross margin for 2021 decreased to 34.1 percent compared to 52.7 percent for 2020. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the additional brands acquired as part of the Merger. The decrease in gross margin was due to sales price, as the vast majority of the Company's branded spirits sales pre-merger were in the ultra premium category. Gross profit was reduced during 2021, due to a required step up in value due to purchase accounting related to the Merger. Of the purchase accounting step up, $2,529 was associated with marking the finished goods inventory to fair value, which fully flowed through in the year and is not expected to recur in the future periods.\nIndustrial Revenue Bonds\nCash used in financing activities for year ended December 31, 2020 was $15,255, primarily due to payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of $8,188 (see Note 8, Equity and EPS for additional information), purchases of treasury stock of $4,411 (see Treasury Purchases), offset by net proceeds from debt of $2,656 (see Long-Term and Short-Term Debt).\nOn February 22, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend payable to stockholders of record as of March 11, 2022, of our Common Stock and a dividend equivalent payable to holders of certain RSUs as of March 11, 2022, of $0.12 per share and per unit. The dividend payment and dividend equivalent payment will occur on March 25, 2022.\n(c)Income attributable to participating securities changes primarily due to the awarding and vesting of the employee RSUs that receive dividend equivalent payments.\n2021 compared to 2020\n(a) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\n", "item_7_text": "Total Ingredient Solutions sales for 2020 increased by $12,551, or 19.2 percent compared to 2019. This increase was driven by higher sales of specialty wheat starches and proteins, partially offset by a decrease in sales of commodity wheat starches and proteins. The increase in sales of specialty wheat starches was driven by increased sales volume and higher average selling prices. The increase in sales of specialty wheat proteins was driven by increased sales volume, partially offset by lower average selling prices. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales volume of commodity wheat starches and proteins.\n(c) Price/Mix change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales-per-unit and prior period sales-per unit, multiplied by current period sales volume.\n2020 compared to 2019\n2020 to 2019 - SG&A expenses for 2020 were $41,853, an increase of 58.2 percent compared to 2019. The increase in SG&A was due primarily to higher personnel and incentive compensation expense, inclusive of certain incremental costs incurred relating to the transition at the CEO position. Additionally, the increase was due to an increase related to advisory and other transaction costs.\n(d) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\nOur strategic plan is designed to leverage our history and strengths as well as to leverage the positive macro trends we see in the industries where we compete while providing better insulation from outside factors, including swings in commodity pricing.\nCash provided by operating activities were $53,255 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The cash provided by operating activities during 2020 resulted primarily from net income of $40,345, adjustments for non-cash or non-operating charges of $17,050 including depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, and deferred income taxes, partially offset by uses of cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $4,140. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were $16,173 use of cash related to an increase in receivables, inclusive of insurance receivables, $3,886 use of cash related to an increase in inventories, partially offset by $11,503 provided by cash related to an increase in accrued expenses primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and $1,817 provided by cash related to an increase in accounts payable related to the timing of cash disbursements. Additionally, there was $1,750 provided by cash related to income taxes payable, due to higher than expected income before taxes.\n\u2022Distillery Products Segment\nGross profit increased year versus year by $38,333, or 50.6 percent. Gross margin for 2021 increased to 32.4 percent from 24.2 percent for 2020. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher sales volume on brown goods as well as higher average selling price on industrial, white goods and fuel grade alcohol. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by lower average selling price on distillers feed and related co-products and higher input costs of industrial alcohol, white goods and brown goods.\n\u2022Results of Operations\n(a)Items are net of tax based on the effective tax rate for each base year.\n2020 compared to 2019\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n(a) Total sales change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales dollars and prior period sales dollars, divided by prior period sales dollars.\n(d) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\n\nIngredient Solutions Segment\nTotal Branded Spirits sales for 2021 increased by $179,417, or 4,324.3 percent compared to 2020. Sales of value, mid, ultra premium, other and premium increased compared to 2020, primarily due to the additional brands acquired as part of the Merger.\n(a) Short-term obligation payments are due within 12 months from the current year end.\nTreasury Purchases. 38,079 RSUs vested and converted to common shares during year ended December 31, 2021, of which we withheld and purchased for treasury 11,887 shares valued at $767 to cover payment of associated withholding taxes.\nWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate adequate cash from operations while having ready access to capital at competitive rates.\n2021 to 2020 - SG&A expenses for 2021 were $72,829, an increase of 74.0 percent compared to 2020. The increase in SG&A was driven by the assumption of Luxco's SG&A, and one-time acquisition related costs.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis if events and circumstances occur that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value. We have the option to evaluate qualitative factors to assess if goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired before quantifying the fair value of the reporting unit. Management judgment is required in the evaluation of qualitative factors, determination of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. To the extent that the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized and allocated to the reporting units. Based on the impairment tests performed by the Company during the fourth quarter 2021, we believe none of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired and are not currently at risk of impairment.\n(c) Price/Mix change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales-per-unit and prior period sales-per unit, multiplied by current period sales volume.\nGross profit increased year versus year by $651, or 42.4 percent. Gross margin for 2020 increased to 52.7 percent compared to 51.3 percent for 2019. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased sales of branded spirits and additional brands acquired during 2020.\nDiluted EPS increased to $4.34 in 2021 from $2.37 in 2020, primarily due the above described changes in Basic EPS, partially offset by the conversion feature of the Convertible Senior Notes.\n2020 to 2019 - Operating income for 2020 increased to $54,241 from $47,242 for 2019, due to increases in gross profit in our Distillery Products, Ingredient Solutions and Branded Spirits segments. These increases were partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses.\n2020 to 2019 - Gross profit for 2020 was $98,806, an increase of 29.1 percent compared to 2019. The increase was driven by an increase in gross profit in the Distillery Products, Ingredient Solutions and Branded Spirits segments. The Distillery Products segment gross profit increased by $11,357, or 17.6 percent, the Ingredient Solutions segment gross profit increased by $10,266, or 97.0 percent, and the Branded Spirits Segment increased by $651, or 42.4 percent.\n(c) Price/Mix change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales-per-unit and prior period sales-per unit, multiplied by current period sales volume.\n(c) Price/Mix change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales-per-unit and prior period sales-per unit, multiplied by current period sales volume.\nDividends and Dividend Equivalents. See Note 8, Equity and EPS for further discussion.\nContractual Obligations\n\u2022New Accounting Pronouncements\n\n2021 compared to 2020\ntrends. Our strategy within the Distillery Products segment is to continue migrating away from industrial alcohol to white beverage alcohol, cultivate additional multi-national and craft customers for brown goods sales, enhance offerings to become a beverage alcohol solution provider\u201d, develop an export market for our aged brown goods, and attract control label customers to boost overall brown goods growth.\n(a) See segment discussion.\nCASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n(d) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\nCapital Spending. We manage capital spending to support our business growth plans. We have incurred $51,691, $18,646, and $18,771 of capital expenditures and have paid $47,389, $19,701, and $16,730 for capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The difference between the amount of capital expenditures incurred and amount paid is due to the change in capital expenditures in accounts payable. The increase in capital expenditures for 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to the replacement of the feed dryer system. We expect approximately $37,200, in capital expenditures for 2022 which will be used for facility improvement and expansion, facility sustenance projects and environmental health and safety projects.\nTotal Branded Spirits sales for 2020 increased by $1,154, or 38.5 percent compared to 2019, primarily driven by an increase in ultra premium. The increase in ultra premium sales was due to expanding into more markets and increasing points of distribution, as well as additional brands acquired during 2020.\nTotal Ingredient Solutions sales for 2021 increased by $12,587, or 16.1 percent compared to 2020. Sales of specialty wheat starches and proteins and commodity wheat starches increased, while sales of commodity wheat proteins decreased. The increase in specialty wheat starches was primarily due to higher sales volume. The increase in specialty wheat proteins was primarily due to higher sales volume and higher average selling prices. The increase in commodity wheat starches was due to higher sales volume.\n2021 to 2020 - Gain on Insurance recoveries for 2021 was $16,325. During November 2020, we experienced a fire at the Atchison facility. The fire damaged certain equipment in the facility's feed drying operations and caused a temporary loss of production time. At December 31, 2021, we received a legally binding commitment from our insurance carrier for final settlement for the replacement of the damaged dryer which resulted in a gain of $16,325.\nDISTILLERY PRODUCTS SEGMENT\nOVERVIEW\nLong-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including brand development, share repurchases, and Board-approved dividends) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $233,399 (net of unamortized loan fees of $6,454) at December 31, 2021 and $39,871 (net of unamortized loan fees of $129) at December 31, 2020. During 2021, we had net borrowings on our Convertible Senior Notes of $201,250, and during 2020, we had net payments on our Credit Agreement of $300. Additionally, during 2021 and 2020, we had net payments on our long-term debt of $1,620, and $1,208, respectively. During 2021 and 2020, we incurred $7,050 and $1,148, respectively, of loan fees associated with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes and refinancing our credit agreement. Net borrowings / (payments) on all debt for 2021 and 2020 were $192,580, and $(2,656), respectively (see Note 6, Corporate borrowings for additional information).\nDryer Fire Incident. During November 2020, we experienced a fire at the Atchison facility. The fire damaged certain equipment in the facility's feed drying operations and caused temporary loss of production time. At December 31, 2021, we received a legally binding commitment from our insurance carrier for final settlement of $43,688, $27,363 was related to business interruption and $16,325 was for the damaged dryer. The business interruption portion of the settlement was recorded as a reduction of Cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income and the insurance recoveries for the replacement of the damaged dryer was recorded as Insurance recoveries on the Consolidated Statement of Income. We recorded a settlement related to the business interruption from our insurance carrier of $23,583 and $3,780 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our insurance provided coverage for business interruption and other losses from damage to property, plant and equipment, less deductibles. We completed the construction of the replacement dryer and placed the dryer into service during 2021.\nThe following table provides information on the amounts and payments of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2021: \nSales\n(d) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\nDistillery Products Segment\n2021 to 2020 - Advertising and promotion expenses for 2021 were $16,098, an increase of 493.6 percent compared to 2020. The increase in Advertising and promotion expenses were primarily driven by the assumption of Luxco's advertising and promotion expenses during 2021.\nBusiness Combinations. The merger with Luxco was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d), and as such, we allocated the consideration paid for a business to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, with the excess recorded to goodwill. The fair value measurements of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Critical estimates used in determining the fair value include, but are not limited to discount rates that would be used by a market participant in valuing these assets and liabilities, forecasted revenue growth rates, including the terminal growth rates, projected cash flows, distributor attrition rates, royalty rates and market comparable, among others. The fair value of personal property assets was determined using the market approach and the indirect and direct method of the cost approach, and the fair value of real property was determined using the cost approach and the sales comparison approach. The fair value of work-in-process and finished goods inventory was determined using the comparative sales method and raw materials was determined using the replacement cost method. The trade names and distributor relationships acquired were adjusted to fair value using the relief from royalty method and multi-period excess earnings method, respectively. Management engaged a third party valuation specialist to assist in the valuation analysis of certain acquired assets including trade name and distributor relationship.\n\u2022Overview\n2021 compared to 2020\n2020 compared to 2019\nShare Repurchase. On February 25, 2019, the Board of Directors approved a $25,000 share repurchase authorization commencing February 27, 2019 through February 27, 2022. Under the share repurchase program, the company can repurchase stock from time to time for cash in open market purchases, block transactions, and privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. This share repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or terminated by the Company at any time without prior notice. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not repurchase any shares of MGP Common Stock and have $20,947 remaining under the share repurchase plan. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased approximately 159,104 shares of MGP Common Stock for $4,053.\nGross profit increased year versus year by $10,266, or 97.0 percent. Gross margin for 2020 increased to 26.7 percent from 16.2 percent for 2019. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by the increased sales volume and higher average selling prices of specialty wheat starches and proteins and decreased sales volume of commodity wheat starches and proteins (mix). Additionally, gross profit was positively impacted by the optimization of higher margin specialty products to meet the increased demand of customers' high fiber and high protein products. These increases in gross profit were partially offset by increased production costs due to the temporary shutdown of the Atchison facilities as a result of the ransomware cyber-attack.\nMerger with Luxco. On January 22, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Luxco, and subsequently completed the Merger on April 1, 2021. Luxco is a leading branded beverage alcohol company across various categories, with a more than 60-year business heritage. Following the Merger, Luxco became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MGP and is included in the Branded Spirits segment. (See Note 4, Business Combinations, for additional information).\nWe continued to focus on attracting and developing customers for our premium beverage alcohol products during 2021 as well as shifting our focus from industrial alcohol to white beverage alcohol. Distillery Products segment sales for 2021 increased 12.5 percent over the prior year.\nOur principal sources of cash are product sales and borrowing on our Credit Agreement, Convertible Senior Notes and Note Purchase Agreement. Under these agreements, we must meet certain financial covenants and restrictions, and at December 31, 2021, we met those covenants and restrictions.\n\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nMGP is a leading producer and supplier of premium distilled spirits, branded spirits and food ingredients. Distilled spirits include premium bourbon and rye whiskeys and GNS, including vodka and gin. Our distilled spirits are either packaged and sold under our own brands to distributors, sold directly or indirectly to manufacturers of other branded spirits, or direct to consumers. We are also a top producer of high quality industrial alcohol for use in both food and non-food applications. Our protein and starch food ingredients provide a host of functional, nutritional and sensory benefits for a wide range of food products to serve the consumer packaged goods industry. Our industrial alcohol and ingredients products are sold directly, or through distributors, to manufacturers and processors of finished packaged goods or to bakeries. The Company reports three operating segments; Distillery Products, Branded Spirits and Ingredient Solutions.\nWe are in various stages of financing projects with industrial revenue bond transactions for our facilities located in Kentucky. The bonds allow a 30 year real property tax abatement on our renovated and newly-constructed warehouse buildings and distilleries in Kentucky. We have been approved for $25,000 of industrial revenue bonds with the City of Williamstown Kentucky, and have used approximately $11,000. Additionally, we have been approved for $50,000 of industrial revenue bonds with Nelson County Kentucky and have used approximately $33,000. The City of Williamstown and Nelson County issued the industrial revenue bonds to us and then used the proceeds to purchase the land and warehouse from us. The city then leased the facilities back to us under a capital lease, the terms of which provide for the payment of basic rent in an amount sufficient to pay principal and interest on the bonds. Our obligation to pay rent under the lease is in the same amount and due on the same date as the city's obligation to pay debt service on the bonds which we hold. The lease permits us to present the bonds at any time for cancellation, upon which our obligation to pay basic rent would be canceled. At the bonds' maturity the facilities will revert to us without costs. If we were to present the bonds for cancellation prior to maturity, a nominal fee would be incurred.\n2021 to 2020 - Gross profit for 2021 was $198,965, an increase of 101.4 percent compared to 2020. The increase was driven by an increase in gross profit in Branded Spirits, Distillery Products and Ingredient Solutions segments. The Branded Spirits segment gross profit increased by $60,457 or 2,764.4 percent. The Distillery Products segment gross profit increased by $38,333, or 50.6 percent and the Ingredient Solutions segment gross profit increased by $1,369, or 6.6 percent.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A\u201d) of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to provide a reader of MGP's consolidated financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. MGP's MD&A is presented in nine sections:\nOur Branded Spirits segment mission is to align our product offering and enhance focus on growing spirits categories and price tiers. The favorable macro industry trends benefiting our business include growth in high-end whiskey and tequila brands as well as growth across all spirit categories in the high-end price tiers. Our Branded Spirits segment is also subject to unfavorable macro trends, which include increased competition as industry participants seek to capitalize on consumer trends. Our strategy for the Branded Spirits segment is to focus on the categories, brands, price points, bottle size and market support that will maximize profit for the Company.\n\u2022Ingredient Solutions Segment\n\u2022Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nAdvertising and promotion expenses\n\n\u2022Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Report on Form 10-K contains forward looking statements as well as historical information.

Within the Distillery Solutions segment, sales were up 6.5 percent primarily due to an increase in sales of brown goods and white goods within premium beverage alcohol, warehouse services, and industrial alcohol. Total Ingredient Solutions segment sales increased 19.2 percent due to increased sales of specialty wheat starches and proteins. Within the Branded Spirits segment, sales were up 38.5 percent due to an increase in sales within the ultra premium category.\nCOVID-19.

These increases were partially offset by increases in SG&A expenses and Advertising and promotion expenses.\nBasic and diluted EPS\nGross profit increased year versus year by $1,369, or 6.6 percent. Gross margin for 2021 decreased to 24.5 percent from 26.7 percent for 2020. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by higher sales volume of specialty wheat starches and commodity wheat starches, as well as higher sales volume and higher average selling prices of specialty wheat proteins. These increases were partially offset by higher input costs.\nTotal Distillery Products sales for 2021 increased by $39,195, or 12.5 percent compared to 2020. Sales of brown goods and white goods within premium beverage alcohol, fuel grade alcohol, and warehouse services increased, while sales of industrial alcohol and distillers feed and related co-products decreased compared to 2020. The increase in brown goods, white goods and fuel grade alcohol was driven by higher sales volume and higher average selling price. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of industrial alcohol, which was driven by lower sales volume due to the discontinuing of the ICP third party sales and marketing services, partially offset by higher average selling price. The decrease in sales of distillers feed and related co-products was due to lower average selling price, partially offset by higher sales volume, both of which resulted from the Dryer Fire Incident and the subsequent sale of wet rather than dry distillers grains (see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies for further details).\n2020 to 2019 - Basic and Diluted EPS increased to $2.37 in 2020 from $2.27 in 2019, primarily due to the increase in Operating income, partially offset by the favorable tax impact of vested share-based awards that occurred during 2019.\n2021 to 2020 - Income tax expense for 2021 was $30,279, for an effective tax rate for the year of 25.0 percent. Income tax expense for 2020 was $12,256, for an effective tax rate for the year of 23.3 percent. The 1.7 percentage point increase was primarily due to higher Income before income taxes, and its dilutive effect on favorable tax credits and deductions as it concerns our effective tax rate.\nTotal Distillery Products sales for 2020 increased by $19,071, or 6.5 percent compared to 2019. Sales of brown goods and white goods within premium beverage alcohol, warehouse services, and industrial alcohol increased, while sales of distillers feed and related co-products and fuel grade alcohol decreased compared to 2019. The increase in brown goods was due to increased sales volume, partially offset by lower average selling price. The increase in white goods and industrial alcohol was due to higher average selling prices, partially offset by decreased sales volume. These increases were slightly offset by decreases in distillers feed and related co-products and fuel grade alcohol due to lower average selling prices.\n(d) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\n(a) Total sales change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales dollars and prior period sales dollars, divided by prior period sales dollars.\n(a) Total sales change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales dollars and prior period sales dollars, divided by prior period sales dollars.\n(b) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\n2020 to 2019 - Advertising and promotion expenses for 2020 were $2,712, a decrease of 4.1 percent compared to 2019. The decrease in Advertising and promotion expenses were driven by a decrease in corporate communications expenses.\n(d) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\nOur Ingredient Solutions segment mission is to remain a strategic business partner of choice earning meaningful relationships through collaboration, innovation, and dedication to the best-in-class customer service. The favorable macro industry trends benefiting our business include growth and focus on high fiber, high protein, meat alternative, plant-based protein, and non-GMO Products. We continue to provide outstanding customer solutions, taking advantage of our position within growing consumer trends. Our strategy within the Ingredient Solutions segment is to expand our market share of specialty wheat starch and protein product lines, expand textured plant protein capabilities within specialty wheat proteins, maximize the value of clean label starches, and optimize our customer set, route to market, and channels to drive profitability. Ingredient Solutions segment sales for 2021 increased 16.1 percent over the prior year, primarily due to increased sales of specialty wheat starches and proteins, and commodity wheat starches.\nThe table below details the consolidated results for 2021, 2020 and 2019: \nSG&A expenses\nAt December 31, 2021, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by $278,298, largely due to our inventories, at cost, of $245,944. At December 31, 2021, our cash balance was $21,568 and we have used our Credit Agreement, Convertible Senior Notes and Note Purchase Agreement for liquidity purposes, with $400,000 remaining for additional borrowings. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We regularly assess our cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. We utilize short-term and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as capital investments and dividend payments. In addition, we have strong operating results such that financial institutions should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements, if needed.\n(c) Price/Mix change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales-per-unit and prior period sales-per unit, multiplied by current period sales volume.\nOn January 22, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Luxco, Inc. and its affiliates ( Luxco\u201d), and subsequently completed the merger on April 1, 2021 (the Merger\u201d). As a result of the Merger, we have increased our scale and market position in the branded-spirits sector and believe it has strengthened our platform for future growth of higher valued-added products. The Branded Spirits segment sales for 2021 increased 4,324.3 percent over the prior year.\n\n\u2022Recent Developments\nOperating cash flow and borrowings through our Credit Agreement, Convertible Senior Notes and Note Purchase Agreement (Note 6, Corporate Borrowings) provide the primary sources of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. These same sources of cash are used to fund shareholder dividends and other discretionary uses. Our overall liquidity reflects our strong business results and an effective cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors, and tax considerations. We expect our sources of cash to be adequate to provide for budgeted capital expenditures, potential merger or acquisitions, and anticipated operating requirements for the foreseeable future.\n31,741 RSUs vested and converted to common shares during year ended December 31, 2020, of which we withheld and purchased for treasury 10,437 shares valued at $358 to cover payment of associated withholding taxes.\n\u2022Branded Spirits Segment\n2021 to 2020 - Sales for 2021 were $626,720, an increase of 58.5 percent compared to 2020, which was the result of increased sales in the Branded Spirits, Distillery Products and Ingredient Solutions segments. Total Branded Spirits segment sales increased 4,324.3 percent, due to the additional brands acquired as part of the Merger. Within the Distillery Products segment, sales were up 12.5 percent primarily due to an increase in sales of brown goods within premium beverage alcohol. Total Ingredient Solutions segment sales increased 16.1 percent primarily due to increased sales of specialty wheat starches and proteins.\nGross profit increased year versus year by $11,357, or 17.6 percent. Gross margin for 2020 increased to 24.2 percent compared to 21.9 percent for 2019. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher sales volume on brown goods and higher average selling price on white goods and industrial alcohol. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by higher costs relating to a reduction in brown goods put-away for aging, lower average selling price on brown goods and increased production costs due to the temporary shutdown of the Atchison facilities as a result of the ransomware cyber-attack.\nCash used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2020 was $19,647, which primarily resulted from additions to property, plant and equipment of $19,701 (see capital spending) and an increase in proceeds from sale of property of $2,906, partially offset by cash of $2,750 used in the acquisition of a business.\nOur principal uses of cash in the ordinary course of business are for input costs used in our production processes, salaries, capital expenditures, and investments supporting our strategic plan, such as the aging of barreled distillate and potential merger and acquisitions. Generally, during periods when commodity prices are rising, our operations require increased use of cash to support inventory levels.\nOperating income \nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities were $88,263 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The cash provided by operating activities during 2021 resulted primarily from net income of $90,817, adjustments for non-cash or non-operating charges of $16,850 including depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, share-based compensation, and partially offset by a gain on insurance recoveries, and by uses of cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $19,404. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were $14,214 use of cash related to an increase in inventories, primarily barrel distillate, $6,242 use of cash related to income taxes refundable, and $6,031 use of cash related to an increase in receivables, inclusive of insurance receivables, partially offset by $5,301 of cash provided by an increase in accounts payable related to the timing of cash disbursements.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(b)Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\n2021 to 2020 - Basic EPS increased to $4.37 in 2021 from $2.37 in 2020, primarily due to the increase in Operating income, partially offset by an increase in shares outstanding as a result of shares issued as part of the consideration paid for the Merger.\n2020 to 2019 - Income tax expense for 2020 was $12,256, for an effective tax rate for the year of 23.3 percent. Income tax expense for 2019 was $7,144, for an effective tax rate for the year of 15.6 percent. The 7.7 percentage point increase was primarily due to the favorable tax impact of vested share-based awards that occurred during 2019.\n(a) Total sales change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales dollars and prior period sales dollars, divided by prior period sales dollars.\nWe recorded the land and buildings as assets in property, plant, and equipment, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Because we own all outstanding bonds, have a legal right to set-off, and intend to set-off the corresponding lease and interest payment, we have netted the capital lease obligation with the bond asset. No amount for our obligation under the capital lease is reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, nor do we reflect an amount for the corresponding industrial revenue bond asset (see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies for additional information).\nBranded Spirits Segment\nOur Distillery Products segment mission is to cultivate lasting partnerships with customers across all product categories by leveraging our strong sales and operating platform, aging whiskey inventory, and unique project development skills. The favorable macro trends benefiting our business include the expansion of the distilled spirits' share within beverage alcohol, particularly growth of the American whiskey category that has continued to expand over the past several years. This includes shifting sales mix to higher margin products, such as premium bourbon and rye whiskeys, as well as extending the product range of distilled gins and grain neutral spirits ( GNS\u201d), the base component for vodka. Our Distillery Products segment is also subject to unfavorable macro trends which include increased competition as industry participants seek to capitalize on consumer\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The application of certain of these policies places demands on management's judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain, inclusive of effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop as forecast, and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment. We have identified the most critical accounting policies which involve the most complex and subjective judgments. These should be read in conjunction with the significant accounting policies discussed in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\n(c) Price/Mix change is calculated by taking the difference between current period sales-per-unit and prior period sales-per unit, multiplied by current period sales volume.\n(b) Includes open purchase order commitments related to raw materials and packaging used in the ordinary course of business of $148,349.\nFinancing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2021 was $94,287, primarily due to net debt proceeds of $192,580 (see Long-Term and Short-Term Debt), primarily resulting from the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, partially offset by $87,509 payment on assumed debt as part of the Merger, and payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of $10,017 (see Note 8, Equity and EPS for additional information),\nGross profit\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2021 was $182,619, which primarily resulted from $149,005 related to the Merger with Luxco and additions to property, plant and equipment of $47,389 (see capital spending), partially offset by cash proceeds of $16,325 from property insurance recoveries.\nBRANDED SPIRITS SEGMENT\nGross profit increased year versus year by $60,457, or 2764.4 percent. Gross margin for 2021 decreased to 34.1 percent compared to 52.7 percent for 2020. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the additional brands acquired as part of the Merger. The decrease in gross margin was due to sales price, as the vast majority of the Company's branded spirits sales pre-merger were in the ultra premium category. Gross profit was reduced during 2021, due to a required step up in value due to purchase accounting related to the Merger. Of the purchase accounting step up, $2,529 was associated with marking the finished goods inventory to fair value, which fully flowed through in the year and is not expected to recur in the future periods.\nIndustrial Revenue Bonds\nCash used in financing activities for year ended December 31, 2020 was $15,255, primarily due to payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of $8,188 (see Note 8, Equity and EPS for additional information), purchases of treasury stock of $4,411 (see Treasury Purchases), offset by net proceeds from debt of $2,656 (see Long-Term and Short-Term Debt).\nOn February 22, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend payable to stockholders of record as of March 11, 2022, of our Common Stock and a dividend equivalent payable to holders of certain RSUs as of March 11, 2022, of $0.12 per share and per unit. The dividend payment and dividend equivalent payment will occur on March 25, 2022.\n(c)Income attributable to participating securities changes primarily due to the awarding and vesting of the employee RSUs that receive dividend equivalent payments.\n2021 compared to 2020\n(a) Percentage points ( pp\u201d).\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these
