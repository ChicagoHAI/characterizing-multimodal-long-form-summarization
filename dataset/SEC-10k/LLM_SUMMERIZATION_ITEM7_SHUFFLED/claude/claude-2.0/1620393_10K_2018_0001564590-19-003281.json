Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and our historical results of operations. The following should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected, forecasted, or expected in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report. Our management believes the assumptions underlying the Company's financial statements and accompanying notes are reasonable. However, the Company's financial statements and accompanying notes may not be an indication of our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2018, our Portfolio consisted of 35 multifamily properties primarily located in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States encompassing 12,555 units of apartment space that was approximately 94.6% leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $985. Substantially all of our business is conducted through the OP. We own the Portfolio through the OP and our TRS. The OP owns approximately 99.9% of the Portfolio; our TRS owns approximately 0.1% of the Portfolio. The OP GP is the sole general partner of the OP. As of December 31, 2018, there were 23,819,402 OP Units outstanding, of which 23,746,169, or 99.7%, were owned by us and 73,233, or 0.3%, were owned by an unaffiliated limited partner (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements).\nWe are primarily focused on directly or indirectly acquiring, owning, and operating well-located multifamily properties with a value-add component in large cities and suburban submarkets of large cities, primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States. We generate revenue primarily by leasing our multifamily properties. We intend to employ targeted management and a value-add program at a majority of our properties in an attempt to improve rental rates and the NOI at our properties and achieve long-term capital appreciation for our stockholders. We are externally managed by the Adviser through the Advisory Agreement, by and among the OP, the Adviser and us. The Advisory Agreement was renewed on February 13, 2019 for a one-year term set to expire on March 16, 2020. The Adviser is wholly owned by NexPoint Advisors, L.P., which is an affiliate of our Sponsor.\nWe began operations on March 31, 2015 as a result of the transfer and contribution by NHF of all but one of the multifamily properties owned by NHF through its wholly owned subsidiary NREO in exchange for 100% of its outstanding common stock. We use the term predecessor\u201d to mean the carve-out business of NREO, which owned all or a majority interest in the multifamily properties transferred or contributed to us by NHF through NREO. On March 31, 2015, NHF distributed all of the outstanding shares of our common stock held by NHF to holders of NHF common shares. We refer to the distribution of our common stock by NHF as the Spin-Off.\u201d Substantially all of our operations were conducted by our predecessor prior to March 31, 2015. With the exception of a nominal amount of initial cash funded at inception, we did not own any assets prior to March 31, 2015. Our predecessor included all of the properties in our Portfolio that were held indirectly by NREO prior to the Spin-Off. Our predecessor was determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. References throughout this report to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d or our,\u201d include the activity of the predecessor defined above.\nOn November 14, 2018, in connection with the 2018 Offering, we issued 2,702,500 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a public offering price of $33.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $84.8 million (after underwriters' discounts and offering costs). We contributed the net proceeds from the 2018 Offering to the OP in exchange for 2,702,500 OP Units, and the OP in turn used a majority of the net proceeds to repay the $50.0 million outstanding under the $60 Million Credit Facility and the $30.0 million outstanding under the $30 Million Bridge Facility (see Notes 6 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements).\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, and expect to continue to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85% of our ordinary income, (2) 95% of our capital gain net income and (3) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. We believe we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nComponents of Our Revenues and Expenses\nRevenues\nRental income. Our earnings are primarily attributable to the rental revenue from our multifamily properties. We anticipate that the leases we enter into for our multifamily properties will typically be for one year or less on average.\nOther income. Other income includes ancillary income earned from tenants such as application fees, late fees, laundry fees, utility reimbursements, and other rental related fees charged to tenants.\nExpenses\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses include property maintenance costs, salary and employee benefit costs, utilities, casualty-related expenses and recoveries and other property operating costs.\nAcquisition costs. Acquisition costs include the costs to acquire additional properties. On October 1, 2016, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-01, which requires an entity to capitalize acquisition costs associated with an acquisition that is determined to be an acquisition of an asset as opposed to an acquisition of a business. Prior to our adoption of ASU 2017-01, acquisition costs were expensed as incurred. We believe most future acquisition costs will be capitalized in accordance with ASU 2017-01.\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes include the property taxes assessed by local and state authorities depending on the location of each property. Insurance includes the cost of commercial, general liability, and other needed insurance for each property.\nProperty management fees. Property management fees include fees paid to BH, our property manager, or other third party management companies for managing each property (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements).\nAdvisory and administrative fees. Advisory and administrative fees include the fees paid to our Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement (see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements).\nCorporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses include, but are not limited to, audit fees, legal fees, listing fees, board of director fees, equity-based compensation expense, investor relations costs and payments of reimbursements to our Adviser for operating expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses and the advisory and administrative fees paid to our Adviser (including advisory and administrative fees on properties defined in the Advisory Agreement as New Assets) will not exceed 1.5% of Average Real Estate Assets per calendar year (or part thereof that the Advisory Agreement is in effect), calculated in accordance with the Advisory Agreement, or the Expense Cap. The Expense Cap does not limit the reimbursement by us of expenses related to securities offerings paid by our Adviser. The Expense Cap also does not apply to legal, accounting, financial, due diligence, and other service fees incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions, extraordinary litigation, or other events outside our ordinary course of business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of real estate assets.\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses include the costs of marketing, professional fees, general office supplies, and other administrative related costs of each property.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs primarily include depreciation of our multifamily properties and amortization of acquired in-place leases.\nOther Income and Expense\nInterest expense. Interest expense primarily includes the cost of interest expense on debt, the amortization of deferred financing costs and the related impact of interest rate derivatives used to manage our interest rate risk.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs. Loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs includes prepayment penalties and defeasance costs, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and fair market value adjustments of assumed debt related to the early repayment of debt, costs incurred in a debt modification that are not capitalized as deferred financing costs and other costs incurred in a debt extinguishment.\nGain on sales of real estate. Gain on sales of real estate includes the gain recognized upon sales of properties. Gain on sales of real estate is calculated by deducting the carrying value of the real estate and costs incurred to sell the properties from the sales prices of the properties.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nThe year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 146,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 144,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (129,805\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (130,946\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28,572\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29,576\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,576\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,719\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sales of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64,623\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,614\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57,973\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,836\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (154\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,609\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (54,983\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change in our net income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to a decrease in gain on sales of real estate, and was partially offset by an increase in total revenues and decreases in total property operating expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs. The change in our net income (loss) between the periods was also due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2017 and 2018 and the timing of the transactions (we acquired one property in the first quarter of 2017, one property in the second quarter of 2017, one property in the fourth quarter of 2017 and three properties in the third quarter of 2018; we sold four properties in the second quarter of 2017, five properties in the third quarter of 2017 and one property in the first quarter of 2018).\nRevenues\nRental income. Rental income was $128.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $125.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $3.0 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2017 and 2018 and the timing of the transactions, as described above, and a 3.9% increase in the weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit in our Portfolio to $985 as of December 31, 2018 from $948 as of December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the value-add program that we have implemented and organic growth in rents in the markets where our properties are located. The increase between the periods was also due to an increase in the occupancy rate of our Portfolio of 0.8% to 94.6% as of December 31, 2018 from 93.8% as of December 31, 2017.\nOther income. Other income was $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $0.6 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2017 and 2018 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The decrease between the periods was also due to a $0.7 million, or 6.0%, decrease in utility reimbursements.\nExpenses\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses were $35.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $3.1 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2017 and 2018 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The decrease between the periods was also due to a $1.5 million, or 13.5%, decrease in utility costs and a $0.8 million, or 4.8%, decrease in labor costs.\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $1.5 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to a $1.5 million, or 9.4%, increase in property taxes. Property taxes incurred in the first year of ownership may be significantly less than subsequent years since the purchase price of the property may trigger a significant increase in assessed value by the taxing authority in subsequent years, increasing the cost of real estate taxes.\nProperty management fees. Property management fees were $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.1 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to an increase in total revenues, which the fee is primarily based on.\nAdvisory and administrative fees. Advisory and administrative fees were $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.1 million. The amount incurred during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 represents the maximum fee allowed on properties defined as Contributed Assets under the Advisory Agreement plus approximately $2.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively, of advisory and administrative fees incurred on certain properties defined as New Assets. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Adviser elected to voluntarily waive the advisory and administrative fees incurred on the eight properties we acquired subsequent to October 2016, which totaled approximately $4.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Adviser elected to voluntarily waive the advisory and administrative fees incurred on the five properties we acquired subsequent to October 2016, which totaled approximately $2.4 million. The advisory and administrative fees waived by our Adviser for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are considered to be permanently waived for the periods. Our Adviser is not contractually obligated to waive fees on New Assets in the future and may cease waiving fees on New Assets at its discretion. Advisory and administrative fees may increase in future periods as we acquire additional properties, which will be classified as New Assets.\nCorporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses were $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $1.5 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to approximately $4.2 million of equity-based compensation expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the grants of restricted stock units to our directors, officers, employees and certain key employees of our Adviser pursuant to our long-term incentive plan (the 2016 LTIP\u201d), compared to $3.1 million of equity-based compensation expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements). Subject to the Expense Cap, corporate general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods as we acquire additional properties.\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses were $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $0.1 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2017 and 2018 and the timing of the transactions, as described above.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs were $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $48.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $1.3 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to the amortization of intangible lease assets of $2.5 million related to four properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $8.9 million related to seven properties for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $6.4 million. The decrease between the periods was partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in depreciation expense, primarily due to our acquisition activity in 2017 and 2018 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The amortization of intangible lease assets over a six-month period from the date of acquisition is expected to increase the amortization expense during the initial year of operations for each property.\nOther Income and Expense\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $1.0 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to an increase in gain recognized related to the effective portion of changes in fair value of our interest rate swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of approximately $5.3 million (see Debt, Derivatives and Hedging Activity - Interest Rate Swap Agreements\u201d below). The decrease between the periods was partially offset by an increase in interest on debt of approximately $4.6 million. The following table details the various costs included in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (345\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest rate swaps - effective portion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,224\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,337\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest rate swaps - ineffective portion\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (309\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest rate caps expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (233\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,004\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Prior to our adoption of ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) ( ASU 2017-12\u201d) on January 1, 2018, the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was recognized directly in net income (loss) as interest expense. The adoption of ASU 2017-12 eliminates the separate measurement of effectiveness and ineffectiveness, and all changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded directly in other comprehensive income ( OCI\u201d). See Notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs. Loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs was $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $2.1 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to decreases in debt modification and other extinguishment costs of approximately $1.5 million and prepayment penalties and defeasance costs of approximately $1.0 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold one property; during the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold nine properties.\nThe year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 144,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 132,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (130,946\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (111,003\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,943\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,556\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29,576\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20,167\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,409\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,719\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,722\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,997\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sales of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,170\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 53,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change in our net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to increases in total revenues and gain on sales of real estate, and was partially offset by increases in total property operating expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs. The change in our net income between the periods was also due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions (we acquired one property in the third quarter of 2016, three properties in the fourth quarter of 2016, one property in the first quarter of 2017, one property in the second quarter of 2017 and one property in the fourth quarter of 2017; we sold three properties in the second quarter of 2016, four properties in the third quarter of 2016, four properties in the second quarter of 2017 and five properties in the third quarter of 2017).\nRevenues\nRental income. Rental income was $125.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $115.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $9.6 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The increase between the periods was also due to a 7.7% increase in the weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit in our Portfolio to $948 as of December 31, 2017 from $880 as of December 31, 2016, primarily driven by the value-add program that we have implemented and organic growth in rents in the markets where our properties are located, and an increase in the occupancy rate of our Portfolio of 0.4% to 93.8% as of December 31, 2017 from 93.4% as of December 31, 2016.\nOther income. Other income was $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $1.8 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The increase between the periods was also due to a $1.1 million, or 11.3%, increase in utility reimbursements and a $0.5 million, or 56.1%, increase in other resident charges.\nExpenses\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses were $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.7 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The increase between the periods was also due to a $1.0 million, or 8.8%, increase in repairs and maintenance costs, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in casualty recoveries.\nAcquisition costs. No acquisition costs were expensed for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired three properties and capitalized all acquisition costs incurred. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired four properties; we expensed the acquisition costs related to one acquisition and capitalized acquisition costs of approximately $0.7 million related to three acquisitions. Acquisition costs depend on the specific circumstances of each closing and are one-time costs associated with each acquisition. We believe most future acquisition costs will be capitalized.\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $3.1 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The increase between the periods was also due to a $2.8 million, or 20.3%, increase in property taxes and a $0.3 million, or 13.6%, increase in property liability insurance. Property taxes incurred in the first year of ownership may be significantly less than subsequent years since the purchase price of the property may trigger a significant increase in assessed value by the taxing authority in subsequent years, increasing the cost of real estate taxes.\nProperty management fees. Property management fees were $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.3 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to increases in rental income and other income, which the fee is primarily based on.\nAdvisory and administrative fees. Advisory and administrative fees were $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.6 million. The amount incurred during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 represents the maximum fee allowed on properties defined as Contributed Assets under the Advisory Agreement plus approximately $2.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, of advisory and administrative fees incurred on certain properties defined as New Assets. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Adviser elected to voluntarily waive the advisory and administrative fees incurred on the five properties we acquired subsequent to October 2016, which totaled approximately $2.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our Adviser elected to voluntarily waive the advisory and administrative fees incurred on the two properties we acquired subsequent to October 2016, which totaled less than $0.1 million. The advisory and administrative fees waived by our Adviser for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are considered to be permanently waived for the periods. Our Adviser is not contractually obligated to waive fees on New Assets in the future and may cease waiving fees on New Assets at its discretion. Advisory and administrative fees may increase in future periods as we acquire additional properties, which will be classified as New Assets.\nCorporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses were $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $2.3 million. The increase between periods primarily relates to $3.1 million of equity-based compensation expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the grants of restricted stock units to our directors and officers pursuant to our 2016 LTIP, compared to $0.8 million of equity-based compensation expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements). Subject to the Expense Cap, corporate general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods as we acquire additional properties.\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses were $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.3 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The increase between the periods was also due to a $0.3 million, or 24.4%, increase in advertising and promotional costs.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs were $48.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $13.2 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the amortization of intangible lease assets of $8.9 million related to seven properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.4 million related to five properties for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $7.5 million, as well as the acquisition of three properties subsequent to December 31, 2016. The amortization of intangible lease assets over a six-month period from the date of acquisition is expected to increase the amortization expense during the initial year of operations for each property. The increase between the periods was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense related to the disposition of nine properties subsequent to December 31, 2016.\nOther Income and Expense\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $9.4 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to an increase in interest on debt and a reduction in gain recognized related to the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of our interest rate swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (see Debt, Derivatives and Hedging Activity - Interest Rate Swap Agreements\u201d below), as shown in the table below. The following table details the various costs included in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest rate swaps - effective portion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest rate swaps - ineffective portion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (309\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,683\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest rate caps expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs. Loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs was $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $4.0 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to increases in prepayment penalties and defeasance costs of approximately $1.9 million and debt modification and other extinguishment costs of approximately $1.8 million. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we sold nine properties and seven properties, respectively. The following table details the various costs included in loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prepayment penalties and defeasance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Write-off of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt modification and other extinguishment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGain on sales of real estate. Gain on sales of real estate was $78.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $52.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold nine properties; during the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold seven properties.\nNon-GAAP Measurements\nNet Operating Income and Same Store Net Operating Income\nNOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties to other comparable properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as NOI is not affected by (1) the cost of funds, (2) acquisition costs, (3) advisory and administrative fees, (4) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, (5) corporate general and administrative expenses, (6) other gains and losses that are specific to us, (7) casualty-related expenses/(recoveries) and (8) property general and administrative expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on our behalf at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees.\nThe cost of funds is eliminated from net income (loss) because it is specific to our particular financing capabilities and constraints. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital, which may have changed or may change in the future. Acquisition costs and non-operating fees to affiliates are eliminated because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our multifamily properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale, which will usually change from period to period. Casualty-related expenses and recoveries are excluded because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. Entity level general and administrative expenses incurred at the properties are eliminated as they are specific to the way in which we have chosen to hold our properties and are the result of our ownership structuring. Also, expenses that are incurred upon acquisition of a property do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these items from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual ongoing revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nHowever, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes corporate general and administrative expenses, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs, acquisition costs, certain fees to affiliates such as advisory and administrative fees, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as determined under GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income, which further limits its usefulness.\nNOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in -Results of Operations\u201d regarding the components of net income (loss) that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.\nWe define Same Store NOI\u201d as NOI for our properties that are comparable between periods. We view Same Store NOI as an important measure of the operating performance of our properties because it allows us to compare operating results of properties owned for the entirety of the current and comparable periods and therefore eliminates variations caused by acquisitions or dispositions during the periods.\nNet Operating Income for Our 2017-2018 Same Store and Non-Same Store Properties for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nThere are 29 properties encompassing 10,123 units of apartment space in our same store pool for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (our 2017-2018 Same Store\u201d properties). Our 2017-2018 Same Store properties exclude the following six properties in our Portfolio as of December 31, 2018: Hollister Place, Rockledge Apartments, Atera Apartments, Cedar Pointe, Crestmont Reserve and Brandywine I & II.\nThe following table reflects the revenues, property operating expenses and NOI for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 for our 2017-2018 Same Store and Non-Same

that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. We also believe that funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), core funds from operations ( Core FFO\u201d) and adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO\u201d) are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT.\nSince the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges. We compute FFO attributable to common stockholders in accordance with NAREIT's definition. Our presentation differs slightly in that we begin with net income (loss) before adjusting for amounts attributable to (1) noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint ventures and (2) redeemable noncontrolling interests in the OP and we show the combined amounts attributable to such noncontrolling interests as an adjustment to arrive at FFO attributable to common stockholders.\nCore FFO makes certain adjustments to FFO, which are either not likely to occur on a regular basis or are otherwise not representative of the ongoing operating performance of our portfolio. Core FFO adjusts FFO to remove items such as acquisition expenses, losses on extinguishment of debt and modification costs (including prepayment penalties and defeasance costs incurred on the early repayment of debt, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and fair market value adjustments of assumed debt related to the early repayment of debt, costs incurred in a debt modification that are not capitalized as deferred financing costs and other costs incurred in a debt extinguishment), casualty-related expenses and recoveries, the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with obtaining short-term debt financing, the ineffective portion of fair value adjustments on interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (see Notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements), and the noncontrolling interests (as described above) related to these items. We believe Core FFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and is useful in comparing our operating performance with other REITs that are not as involved in the aforementioned activities.\nAFFO makes certain adjustments to Core FFO in order to arrive at a more refined measure of the operating performance of our portfolio. There is no industry standard definition of AFFO and practice is divergent across the industry. AFFO adjusts Core FFO to remove items such as equity-based compensation expense and the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with obtaining long-term debt financing, and the noncontrolling interests (as described above) related to these items. We believe AFFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and is useful in comparing our operating performance with other REITs that are not as involved in the aforementioned activities.\nThe effect of the conversion of OP Units held by noncontrolling limited partners is not reflected in the computation of basic and diluted FFO, Core FFO and AFFO per share, as they are exchangeable for common stock on a one-for-one basis. The FFO, Core FFO and AFFO allocable to such units is allocated on this same basis and reflected in the adjustments for noncontrolling interests in the table below. As such, the assumed conversion of these units would have no net impact on the determination of diluted FFO, Core FFO and AFFO per share. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nWe believe that the use of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. While FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income (loss) as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO, Core FFO and AFFO do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO, Core FFO and AFFO reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define Core FFO or AFFO differently than we do.\nThe following table reconciles our calculations of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,614\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sales of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,742\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (78,365\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25,932\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustment for noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (96\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,695\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,583\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO per share -

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $2.0 million of renovation value-add reserves for our planned capital expenditures to implement our value-add program. Renovation value-add reserves are not required to be held in escrow by a third party. We may reallocate these funds, at our discretion, to pursue other investment opportunities or meet our short-term liquidity requirements.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional multifamily properties, renovations and other capital expenditures to improve our multifamily properties and scheduled debt payments and distributions. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, which may include a revolving credit facility and future debt or equity issuances, existing working capital, net cash provided by operations, long-term mortgage indebtedness and other secured and unsecured borrowings, and property dispositions. However, there are a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including the state of overall equity and credit markets, our degree of leverage, our unencumbered asset base and borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders (including as a result of any failure to comply with financial covenants in our existing and future indebtedness), general market conditions for REITs, our operating performance and liquidity, market perceptions about us and restrictions on sales of properties under the Code. The success of our business strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to access these various capital sources.\nIn addition to our value-add program, our multifamily properties will require periodic capital expenditures and renovation to remain competitive. Also, acquisitions, redevelopments, or expansions of our multifamily properties will require significant capital outlays. Long-term, we may not be able to fund such capital improvements solely from net cash provided by operations because we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deductions for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT, and we are subject to tax on any retained income and gains. As a result, our ability to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, or redevelopment through retained earnings long-term is limited. Consequently, we expect to rely heavily upon the availability of debt or equity capital for these purposes. If we are unable to obtain the necessary capital on favorable terms, or at all, our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe believe that our available cash, expected operating cash flows, and potential debt or equity financings will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated scheduled debt service payments and dividend requirements for the twelve-month period following December 31, 2018.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents selected data from our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (136,954\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (51,904\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (51,843\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (119\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,013\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,834\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nCash flows from operating activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $41.7 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to an increase in total revenues, decreases in total property operating expenses, prepayment penalties and defeasance costs and debt modification and other extinguishment costs paid and changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash flows from investing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $137.0 million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in cash flows from investing activities was mainly due to a decrease in net proceeds from sales of real estate. We sold one property for net proceeds of approximately $29.6 million during the period in 2018; we sold nine properties for net proceeds of approximately $224.4 million during the period in 2017. The change in cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by the acquisition of three properties for a combined purchase price of approximately $131.0 million during the period in 2018 compared to the acquisition of three properties for a combined purchase price of approximately $197.2 million during the period in 2017.\nCash flows from financing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $95.1 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in cash flows from financing activities was mainly due to receiving net proceeds of approximately $84.8 million in the 2018 Offering and a net increase in debt of approximately $14.1 million between the periods, partially offset by increases in common stock repurchases of approximately $7.2 million and common stock dividends paid of approximately $3.0 million between the periods and the $51.7 million purchase amount of the purchase of 100% of the joint venture interests in our Portfolio owned by BH Equities, LLC\nand its affiliates (collectively, BH Equity\u201d) (the BH Buyout\u201d) during the period in 2017 (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements).\nThe year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nCash flows from operating activities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $37.5 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to an increase in total revenues, partially offset by increases in total property operating expenses, interest on debt, prepayment penalties and defeasance costs and debt modification and other extinguishment costs paid and changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash flows from investing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by investing activities was $2.3 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $51.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flows from investing activities was mainly due to the acquisition of three properties for a combined purchase price of approximately $197.2 million during the period in 2017, compared to the acquisition of four properties for a combined purchase price of approximately $175.1 million during the period in 2016. The change in cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from sales of real estate; we sold nine properties for net proceeds of approximately $224.4 million during the period in 2017, compared to selling seven properties for net proceeds of approximately $131.8 million during the period in 2016.\nCash flows from financing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $51.8 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flows from financing activities was mainly due to a net decrease in debt of approximately $13.9 million between the periods and the $51.7 million purchase amount of the BH Buyout during the period in 2017.\nDebt, Derivatives and Hedging Activity\nMortgage Debt\nAs of December 31, 2018, our subsidiaries had aggregate mortgage debt outstanding to third parties of approximately $845.7 million at a weighted average interest rate of 4.07% and an adjusted weighted average interest rate of 3.17%. For purposes of calculating the adjusted weighted average interest rate of our mortgage debt outstanding, we have included the weighted average fixed rate of 1.3388% for one-month LIBOR on our combined $650.0 million notional amount of interest rate swap agreements, which effectively fix the interest rate on $650.0 million of our floating rate mortgage debt. See Notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nWe have entered into and expect to continue to enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements with various third parties to fix or cap the floating interest rates on a majority of our floating rate mortgage debt outstanding. The interest rate swap agreements generally have a term of four to five years and effectively establish a fixed interest rate on debt on the underlying notional amounts. The interest rate swap agreements involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. As of December 31, 2018, interest rate swap agreements effectively covered $650.0 million, or 80%, of our $808.0 million of floating rate mortgage debt outstanding.\nThe interest rate cap agreements generally have a term of three to four years, cover the outstanding principal amount of the underlying debt and are generally required by our lenders. Under the interest rate cap agreements, we pay a fixed fee in exchange for the counterparty to pay any interest above a maximum rate. As of December 31, 2018, interest rate cap agreements covered $255.2 million of our $808.0 million of floating rate mortgage debt outstanding. These interest rate cap agreements effectively cap one-month LIBOR on $255.2 million of our floating rate mortgage debt at a weighted average rate of 5.82%.\nRefinancings.

We expect that future investments in properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed by, in whole or in part, our existing cash, future borrowings and the proceeds from additional issuances of common stock or other securities or property dispositions.\nAlthough we expect to be subject to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, we expect that we will be able to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness for acquisitions or other purposes, if needed. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness or access additional sources of capital, such as by issuing common stock or other debt or equity securities, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.\nFurthermore, following the completion of our value-add and capital expenditures programs and depending on the interest rate environment at the applicable time, we may seek to refinance our floating rate debt into longer-term fixed rate debt at lower leverage levels.\n$60 Million Credit Facility\nOn December 29, 2016, we, through the OP, entered into a $30.0 million credit facility (the $30 Million Credit Facility\u201d) with KeyBank. On April 27, 2018, we, through the OP, amended the $30 Million Credit Facility to temporarily increase the loan commitment by $5.0 million (the Temporary Increase\u201d) and immediately drew $5.0 million. The $5.0 million drawn under the Temporary Increase was repaid in full on July 25, 2018.\nOn September 26, 2018, we, through the OP, repaid the $30.0 million outstanding under the $30 Million Credit Facility and amended the loan agreement, extending the maturity date to September 26, 2020 and increasing the loan commitment to $60.0 million (the $60 Million Credit Facility\u201d). We, through the OP, immediately drew $50.0 million to fund a portion of the purchase price of Brandywine I & II and Crestmont Reserve.\nThe $60 Million Credit Facility was a full-term, interest-only facility with a 24-month term and was guaranteed by us. Interest accrued on the $60 Million Credit Facility at an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2.00%. In November 2018, we, through the OP, used net proceeds from the 2018 Offering to repay the $50.0 million outstanding under the $60 Million Credit Facility, which retired the credit facility. In connection with the repayment, we, through the OP, received a commitment fee rebate of approximately $0.8 million from KeyBank, which was previously capitalized as a deferred financing cost on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2018. See Notes 5, 6 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n$30 Million Bridge Facility\nOn September 26, 2018, we, through the OP, entered into a $30.0 million bridge facility (the $30 Million Bridge Facility\u201d) with KeyBank and immediately drew $30.0 million to fund a portion of the purchase price of Brandywine I & II and Crestmont Reserve. The $30 Million Bridge Facility was a full-term, interest-only facility with a six-month term and was guaranteed by us. Interest accrued on the $30 Million Bridge Facility at an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2.00%. In November 2018, we, through the OP, used net proceeds from the 2018 Offering to repay the $30.0 million outstanding under the $30 Million Bridge Facility, which retired the bridge facility. In connection with the repayment, we, through the OP, received a commitment fee rebate of approximately $0.3 million from KeyBank, which was previously capitalized as a deferred financing cost on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2018. See Notes 5, 6 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n2017 Bridge Facility\nOn June 30, 2017, we, through the OP, entered into a $65.9 million bridge facility (the 2017 Bridge Facility\u201d) with KeyBank. The 2017 Bridge Facility was a full-term, interest-only facility with an initial four-month term. The 2017 Bridge Facility was guaranteed by us. Interest accrued on the 2017 Bridge Facility at an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 3.75%. In July 2017, we used proceeds from the sale of Regatta Bay to pay down $11.3 million on the 2017 Bridge Facility. In October 2017, we used proceeds from the sale of four properties to pay down $46.0 million on the 2017 Bridge Facility, bringing the outstanding principal balance to $8.6 million, and also extended the maturity date to March 31, 2018. In February 2018, we used proceeds from the sale of Timberglen to pay the remaining $8.6 million outstanding on the 2017 Bridge Facility, which retired the bridge facility. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n$75 Million Credit Facility\nOn January 28, 2019, we, through the OP, entered into a $75.0 million credit facility (the $75 Million Credit Facility\u201d) with SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto, and immediately drew $52.5 million to fund a portion of the purchase price of three properties we acquired on January 28, 2019. The $75 Million Credit Facility is a full-term, interest-only facility with an initial 24-month term, has one 12-month extension option, bears interest at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus a range from 2.00% to 2.50%, depending on our leverage level as determined under the credit facility agreement, and is guaranteed by us. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nIn order to fix a portion of, and mitigate the risk associated with, our floating rate indebtedness (without incurring substantial prepayment penalties or defeasance costs typically associated with fixed rate indebtedness when repaid early or refinanced), we, through the OP, have entered into seven interest rate swap transactions with KeyBank (the Counterparty\u201d) with a combined notional amount of $650.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, the interest rate swaps we have entered into effectively replace the floating interest rate (one-month LIBOR) with respect to $650.0 million of our floating rate mortgage debt outstanding with a weighted average fixed rate of 1.3388%. During the term of these interest rate swap agreements, we are required to make monthly fixed rate payments of 1.3388%, on a weighted average basis, on the notional amounts, while the Counterparty is obligated to make monthly floating rate payments based on one-month LIBOR to us referencing the same notional amounts. For purposes of hedge accounting under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 815, Derivatives and Hedging, we have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. See Notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe following table contains summary information regarding our outstanding interest rate swaps (dollars in thousands):\nTable 245: <table> <tr> <td> Effective Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Termination Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Notional\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fixed Rate (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> July 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 1, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1055\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> July 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 1, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0210\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> July 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 1, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9000\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 1, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> June 1, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9560\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> April 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1, 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9570\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> May 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 1, 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9610\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> July 1, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> July 1, 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7820\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 650,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3388\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The floating rate option for the interest rate swaps is one-month LIBOR.

We have allocated the total impact of expected settlements on the $650.0 million notional amount of interest rate swaps to \u2018Operating Properties Mortgage Debt.' We used one-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2018 to determine our expected settlements through the terms of the interest rate swaps.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Expenditures and Value-Add Program\nWe anticipate incurring average annual repairs and maintenance expense of $575 to $725 per apartment unit in connection with the ongoing operations of our business. These expenditures are expensed as incurred. In addition, we reserve, on average, approximately $250 to $350 per apartment unit for non-recurring capital expenditures and/or lender required replacement reserves. When incurred, these expenditures are either capitalized or expensed, in accordance with GAAP, depending on the type of the expenditure. Although we will continuously monitor the adequacy of this average, we believe these figures to be sufficient to maintain the properties at a high level in the markets in which we operate. A majority of the properties in our Portfolio were underwritten and acquired with the premise that we would invest $4,000 to $10,000 per unit in the first 36 months of ownership, in an effort to add value to the asset's exterior and interiors. In most cases, we reserved cash at closing to fund these planned capital expenditures and value-add improvements. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $2.0 million of renovation value-add reserves for our planned capital expenditures and other expenses to implement our value-add program, which will complete approximately 325 planned interior rehabs. The following table sets forth a summary of our capital expenditures related to our value-add program for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rehab Expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interior\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exterior and common area\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total rehab expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Includes total capital expenditures during the period on completed and in-progress interior rehabs.

In the second quarter of 2017, we escrowed approximately $4.2 million to finance smarter, greener property improvements at 18 of our properties. In connection with the three acquisitions and seven refinancings we completed in 2018, we escrowed approximately $1.2 million related to the Green Program. Since the inception of the Green Program through December 31, 2018, we had spent approximately $2.5 million on green improvements and completed 17 Green Programs. We expect to spend approximately $1.1 million on green improvements in 2019. We expect to reduce water/sewer costs at each property where the Green Program is implemented by at least 15% through the replacement of showerheads, plumbing fixtures and toilets with modern energy efficient upgrades. In 2018, for the 17 properties where the Green Program was completed, this resulted in an estimated reduction of utility costs of approximately $1.4 million.\nEmerging Growth Company\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We may elect to comply with public company effective dates at any time, and such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.\nWe could remain an emerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of becoming a public company, (2) the last day of the first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more, (3) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million, measured as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months) or (4) the date on which we have, during the preceding three year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt.\nIncome Taxes\nWe anticipate that we will continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and we intend to continue to be organized and to operate in a manner that will permit us to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85% of our ordinary income, (2) 95% of our capital gain net income and (3) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing taxable income. Any resulting corporate liability could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.\nWe evaluate the accounting and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d (greater than 50 percent probability) of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Our management is required to analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all major jurisdictions, which include federal and certain states. We have no examinations in progress and none are expected at this time.\nWe recognize our tax positions and evaluate them using a two-step process. First, we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Second, we will determine the amount of benefit to recognize and record the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nWe had no material unrecognized tax benefit or expense, accrued interest or penalties as of December 31, 2018. We and our subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax as well as income tax of various state and local jurisdictions. The 2017, 2016 and 2015 tax years remain open to examination by tax jurisdictions to which our subsidiaries and we are subject. When applicable, we recognize interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nDividends\nWe intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85% of our ordinary income, (2) 95% of our capital gain net income and (3) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. We intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments of all or substantially all of our taxable income to holders of our common stock out of assets legally available for this purpose, if and to the extent authorized by our Board. Before we make any dividend payments, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or raise additional capital to make cash dividends or we may make a portion of the required dividend in the form of a taxable distribution of stock or debt securities.\nWe will make dividend payments based on our estimate of taxable earnings per share of common stock, but not earnings calculated pursuant to GAAP. Our dividends and taxable income and GAAP earnings will typically differ due to items such as depreciation and amortization, fair value adjustments, differences in premium amortization and discount accretion, and non-deductible general and administrative expenses. Our quarterly dividends per share may be substantially different than our quarterly taxable earnings and GAAP earnings per share. Our Board declared our fourth quarterly dividend of 2018 of $0.275 per share on October 29, 2018, which was paid on December 31, 2018 and funded out of cash flows from operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate these judgments, assumptions and estimates for changes that would affect the reported amounts. These estimates are based on management's historical industry experience and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these judgments, assumptions and estimates. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nWe account for subsidiary partnerships, joint ventures and other similar entities in which we hold an ownership interest in accordance with FASB ASC 810, Consolidation. We first evaluate whether each entity is a VIE. Under the VIE model, we consolidate an entity when we have control to direct the activities of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Under the voting model, we consolidate an entity when we control the entity through ownership of a majority voting interest. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of us and our subsidiaries, including the OP and its subsidiaries.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur primary operations consist of rental income earned from our residents under lease agreements typically with terms of one year or less. Rental income is recognized when earned. This policy effectively results in income recognition on the straight-line method over the related terms of the leases. Resident reimbursements and other income consist of charges billed to residents for utilities, carport and garage rental, and pets, administrative, application and other fees and are recognized when earned.\nReal Estate Investments\nUpon acquisition of a property, the purchase price and related acquisition costs ( total consideration\u201d) are allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and intangible lease assets in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations, and ASU 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business (Topic 805) ( ASU 2017-01\u201d), which we early adopted on October 1, 2016. We believe most future acquisition costs will be capitalized in accordance with ASU 2017-01. Prior to our adoption of ASU 2017-01, acquisition costs were expensed as incurred.\nThe allocation of total consideration, which is determined using inputs that are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy established by FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements), is based on management's estimate of the property's as-if\u201d vacant fair value and is calculated by using all available information such as the replacement cost of such asset, appraisals, property condition reports, market data and other related information. The allocation of the total consideration to intangible lease assets represents the value associated with the in-place leases, which may include lost rent, leasing commissions, legal and other related costs, which we, as buyer of the property, did not have to incur to obtain the residents. If any debt is assumed in an acquisition, the difference between the fair value, which is estimated using inputs that are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and the face value of debt is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt assumed.\nReal estate assets, including land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and intangible lease assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized at cost.\nReal estate assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In such cases, we will evaluate the recoverability of such real estate assets based on estimated future cash flows and the estimated liquidation value of such real estate assets, and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the real estate asset. If impaired, the real estate asset will be written down to its estimated fair value.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We may elect to comply with public company effective dates at any time, and such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. The following recent accounting pronouncements reflect effective dates that delay the adoption until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) ( ASU 2017-12\u201d), which clarifies hedge accounting requirements, improves disclosure of hedging arrangements, and better aligns risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. We early adopted ASU 2017-12 on January 1, 2018, on a modified retrospective basis. For cash flow hedges existing as of the date of adoption, we eliminated the separate measurement of ineffectiveness by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated OCI with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated earnings less dividends on January 1, 2018. The cumulative-effect adjustment, which eliminated the cumulative ineffectiveness that was previously reported in interest expense, resulted in an increase to OCI of approximately $1.4 million, with a corresponding decrease to accumulated earnings less dividends.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity should also disclose sufficient quantitative and qualitative information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date, which amends ASU 2014-09 to defer the effective date by one year. The new standard is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities are allowed to use either the full or modified retrospective approach when transitioning to the ASU. We will implement the provisions of ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a substantial portion of our revenue consists of rental income from leasing arrangements, which is specifically excluded from ASU 2014-09.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01\u201d), which changes certain recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The ASU requires all equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or resulting in consolidation, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also simplifies the impairment assessment for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, amends the presentation requirements for changes in the fair value of financial liabilities, requires presentation of financial instruments by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We will implement the provisions of ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as we do not, nor do we expect to, have a material amount of financial assets or financial liabilities that would be subject to the provisions of ASU 2016-01.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which supersedes the current accounting for leases and while retaining two distinct types of leases, finance and operating, (1) requires lessees to record a right of use asset and a related liability for the rights and obligations associated with a lease, regardless of lease classification, and recognize lease expense in a manner similar to current accounting, (2) eliminates most real estate specific lease provisions and (3) aligns many of the underlying lessor model principles with those in the new revenue standard. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach when transitioning to the ASU for leases that exist as of or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We expect to implement the provisions of ASU 2016-02 as of January 1, 2020. As lessors, substantially all of our agreements have a term of 12 months or less. Based on a preliminary assessment, we expect most of our operating leases will be subject to the new guidance and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption, resulting in an immaterial increase in the assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We are continuing our evaluation, which may identify additional impacts this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases - Targeted Improvements ( ASU 2018-11\u201d), which provides entities with relief from the costs of implementing certain aspects of ASU 2016-02. The ASU provides a practical expedient which allows lessors to not separate lease and non-lease components in a contract and allocate the consideration in the contract to the separate components if both (i) the timing and pattern of revenue recognition for the non-lease component and the related lease component are the same and (ii) the combined single lease component would be classified as an operating lease. We intend to elect the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component in lease contracts where we are the lessor. The ASU also provides a transition option that permits entities to not recast the comparative periods presented when transitioning to the standard. We also intend to elect the transition option.\nIn August 2018, the SEC adopted SEC Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification (the SEC Release\u201d), which amends certain disclosure requirements that were redundant, duplicative, overlapping or superseded by other SEC disclosure requirements or GAAP. The amendments generally eliminated or otherwise reduced certain disclosure requirements of various SEC rules and regulations. However, in some cases, the amendments require additional information to be disclosed, including changes in stockholders' equity in interim periods. Under the SEC Release, registrants will be required to disclose in interim periods on Form 10-Q the changes in each caption of stockholders' equity and noncontrolling interests for the current and comparative year-to-date periods, with subtotals for each interim period and the amount of dividends per share for each class of shares. The amendments require registrants, including smaller reporting companies, to provide information as prescribed by Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X. Therefore, the interim disclosures of changes in stockholders' equity, including dividends per share amounts, may be given in a note to the financial statements or in a separate financial statement. Under Rule 3-04, the interim disclosures of the changes in stockholders' equity should be in the form of a reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance for each period for which an income statement is required to be filed, with all significant reconciling items described by appropriate captions. The reconciliation should also reflect any adjustments to the balance at the beginning of the earliest period presented for items retroactively applied to periods prior to that period. We adopted the provisions of the SEC Release on September 30, 2018, on a retrospective basis.\nInflation\nThe real estate market has not been affected significantly by inflation in the past several years due to a relatively low inflation rate. The majority of our lease terms are for a period of one year or less and reset to market if renewed. The majority of our leases also contain protection provisions applicable to reimbursement billings for utilities. Should inflation return, due to the short-term nature of our leases, we do not believe our results will be materially affected.\nInflation may also affect the overall cost of debt, as the implied cost of capital increases. Currently, interest rates are less than historical averages. However, the Federal Reserve, in response to or in anticipation of continued inflation concerns, could continue to raise interest rates. We intend to mitigate these risks through long-term fixed interest rate loans and interest rate hedges, which to date have included interest rate cap and interest rate swap agreements.\nREIT Tax Election\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code and expect to continue to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income,\u201d as defined by the Code, to our stockholders. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. We believe we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT.", "item_7_truncated": "NOI and 2016-2018 Same Store NOI for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (136,954\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (51,904\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (51,843\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (119\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,013\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,834\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n$30 Million Bridge Facility\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,614\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sales of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,742\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (78,365\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25,932\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustment for noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (96\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,695\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,583\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO per share -

with KeyBank and immediately drew $30.0 million to fund a portion of the purchase price of Brandywine I & II and Crestmont Reserve. The $30 Million Bridge Facility was a full-term, interest-only facility with a six-month term and was guaranteed by us. Interest accrued on the $30 Million Bridge Facility at an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2.00%. In November 2018, we, through the OP, used net proceeds from the 2018 Offering to repay the $30.0 million outstanding under the $30 Million Bridge Facility, which retired the bridge facility. In connection with the repayment, we, through the OP, received a commitment fee rebate of approximately $0.3 million from KeyBank, which was previously capitalized as a deferred financing cost on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2018.

We have no examinations in progress and none are expected at this time.\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td> Property Name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Date of\nRefinance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Accounting\nTreatment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Write-off of\nDeferred Financing Costs (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Capitalized Deferred\nFinancing Costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Prepayment Penalties\nand\nDefeasance Costs (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Debt Modification\nand Other\nExtinguishment Costs (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Reduction in Spread\n(in basis points) (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Belmont at Duck Creek\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6/1/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sabal Palm at Lake Buena Vista\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8/20/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Abbington Heights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8/21/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beechwood Terrace\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8/31/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Timber Creek\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9/28/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Radbourne Lake\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9/28/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hollister Place\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9/28/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Modification\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReal estate assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In such cases, we will evaluate the recoverability of such real estate assets based on estimated future cash flows and the estimated liquidation value of such real estate assets, and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the real estate asset. If impaired, the real estate asset will be written down to its estimated fair value.\n\n2016-2018 Same Store Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases - Targeted Improvements ( ASU 2018-11\u201d), which provides entities with relief from the costs of implementing certain aspects of ASU 2016-02. The ASU provides a practical expedient which allows lessors to not separate lease and non-lease components in a contract and allocate the consideration in the contract to the separate components if both (i) the timing and pattern of revenue recognition for the non-lease component and the related lease component are the same and (ii) the combined single lease component would be classified as an operating lease. We intend to elect the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component in lease contracts where we are the lessor. The ASU also provides a transition option that permits entities to not recast the comparative periods presented when transitioning to the standard. We also intend to elect the transition option.\nWe intend to invest in additional multifamily properties as suitable opportunities arise and adequate sources of equity and debt financing are available. We expect that future investments in properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed by, in whole or in part, our existing cash, future borrowings and the proceeds from additional issuances of common stock or other securities or property dispositions.\nRevenues\nWe are primarily focused on directly or indirectly acquiring, owning, and operating well-located multifamily properties with a value-add component in large cities and suburban submarkets of large cities, primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States. We generate revenue primarily by leasing our multifamily properties. We intend to employ targeted management and a value-add program at a majority of our properties in an attempt to improve rental rates and the NOI at our properties and achieve long-term capital appreciation for our stockholders. We are externally managed by the Adviser through the Advisory Agreement, by and among the OP, the Adviser and us. The Advisory Agreement was renewed on February 13, 2019 for a one-year term set to expire on March 16, 2020. The Adviser is wholly owned by NexPoint Advisors, L.P., which is an affiliate of our Sponsor.\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing taxable income. Any resulting corporate liability could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.\nSee reconciliation of net income (loss) to NOI below under NOI and 2016-2018 Same Store NOI for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\u201d\nWe intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85% of our ordinary income, (2) 95% of our capital gain net income and (3) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. We intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments of all or substantially all of our taxable income to holders of our common stock out of assets legally available for this purpose, if and to the extent authorized by our Board. Before we make any dividend payments, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or raise additional capital to make cash dividends or we may make a portion of the required dividend in the form of a taxable distribution of stock or debt securities.\n (2) Indicates coverage ratio of FFO/Core FFO/AFFO per common share (diluted) over dividends declared per common share during the period. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nComponents of Our Revenues and Expenses\nRefinancings. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we refinanced mortgages on seven properties, as detailed in the table below (dollars in thousands). See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe following table reflects the revenues, property operating expenses and NOI for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 for our 2016-2018 Same Store and Non-Same Store properties (dollars in thousands):\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate these judgments, assumptions and estimates for changes that would affect the reported amounts. These estimates are based on management's historical industry experience and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these judgments, assumptions and estimates. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.\n (5) For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, excludes approximately $281,000 and $191,000, respectively, of expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on our behalf at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees. \nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which supersedes the current accounting for leases and while retaining two distinct types of leases, finance and operating, (1) requires lessees to record a right of use asset and a related liability for the rights and obligations associated with a lease, regardless of lease classification, and recognize lease expense in a manner similar to current accounting, (2) eliminates most real estate specific lease provisions and (3) aligns many of the underlying lessor model principles with those in the new revenue standard. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach when transitioning to the ASU for leases that exist as of or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We expect to implement the provisions of ASU 2016-02 as of January 1, 2020. As lessors, substantially all of our agreements have a term of 12 months or less. Based on a preliminary assessment, we expect most of our operating leases will be subject to the new guidance and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption, resulting in an immaterial increase in the assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We are continuing our evaluation, which may identify additional impacts this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNet Operating Income for Our 2017-2018 Same Store and Non-Same Store Properties for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\n\n \u2022 capital expenditures to continue our value-add program and to improve the quality and performance of our multifamily properties; \nWe believe that our available cash, expected operating cash flows, and potential debt or equity financings will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated scheduled debt service payments and dividend requirements for the twelve-month period following December 31, 2018.\nExpenses\nInterest expense. Interest expense primarily includes the cost of interest expense on debt, the amortization of deferred financing costs and the related impact of interest rate derivatives used to manage our interest rate risk.\nThe year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nCash flows from operating activities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $37.5 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to an increase in total revenues, partially offset by increases in total property operating expenses, interest on debt, prepayment penalties and defeasance costs and debt modification and other extinguishment costs paid and changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nThe $60 Million Credit Facility was a full-term, interest-only facility with a 24-month term and was guaranteed by us. Interest accrued on the $60 Million Credit Facility at an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2.00%. In November 2018, we, through the OP, used net proceeds from the 2018 Offering to repay the $50.0 million outstanding under the $60 Million Credit Facility, which retired the credit facility. In connection with the repayment, we, through the OP, received a commitment fee rebate of approximately $0.8 million from KeyBank, which was previously capitalized as a deferred financing cost on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2018. See Notes 5, 6 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nProperty management fees. Property management fees were $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.1 million, or 6.9%. The majority of the increase is related to a $5.0 million, or 6.2%, increase in rental income, and a $1.3 million, or 11.1%, increase in other income, which the fee is primarily based on.\n (2) Adjustment to net income (loss) to exclude certain property general and administrative expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on our behalf at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees. \nRevenues\nCore FFO was $35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $5.0 million. The change in our Core FFO between the periods primarily relates to an increase in FFO, partially offset by a decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs of $2.1 million and adjustments for amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n\n (2) Fees incurred to an unaffiliated third party that is an affiliate of the noncontrolling limited partner of the OP. \n (5) Represents the weighted average reduction in the borrowing spreads. \nThe following table, which has not been adjusted for the effects of noncontrolling interests, reconciles our NOI and our 2017-2018 Same Store NOI for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (in thousands):\nMortgage Debt\nIncome Taxes\nProperty management fees. Property management fees include fees paid to BH, our property manager, or other third party management companies for managing each property (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements).\n$75 Million Credit Facility\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018 for the next five calendar years subsequent to December 31, 2018. We used one-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2018 to calculate interest expense due by period on our floating rate debt and net interest expense due by period on our interest rate swaps.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional multifamily properties, renovations and other capital expenditures to improve our multifamily properties and scheduled debt payments and distributions. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, which may include a revolving credit facility and future debt or equity issuances, existing working capital, net cash provided by operations, long-term mortgage indebtedness and other secured and unsecured borrowings, and property dispositions. However, there are a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including the state of overall equity and credit markets, our degree of leverage, our unencumbered asset base and borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders (including as a result of any failure to comply with financial covenants in our existing and future indebtedness), general market conditions for REITs, our operating performance and liquidity, market perceptions about us and restrictions on sales of properties under the Code. The success of our business strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to access these various capital sources.\nNOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties to other comparable properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as NOI is not affected by (1) the cost of funds, (2) acquisition costs, (3) advisory and administrative fees, (4) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, (5) corporate general and administrative expenses, (6) other gains and losses that are specific to us, (7) casualty-related expenses/(recoveries) and (8) property general and administrative expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on our behalf at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our subsidiaries had aggregate mortgage debt outstanding to third parties of approximately $845.7 million at a weighted average interest rate of 4.07% and an adjusted weighted average interest rate of 3.17%. For purposes of calculating the adjusted weighted average interest rate of our mortgage debt outstanding, we have included the weighted average fixed rate of 1.3388% for one-month LIBOR on our combined $650.0 million notional amount of interest rate swap agreements, which effectively fix the interest rate on $650.0 million of our floating rate mortgage debt. See Notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nReal Estate Investments\nThe following table reflects the revenues, property operating expenses and NOI for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 for our 2017-2018 Same Store and Non-Same Store properties (dollars in thousands):\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code and expect to continue to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income,\u201d as defined by the Code, to our stockholders. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. We believe we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT.\nCash Flows\nThere are 29 properties encompassing 10,123 units of apartment space in our same store pool for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (our 2017-2018 Same Store\u201d properties). Our 2017-2018 Same Store properties exclude the following six properties in our Portfolio as of December 31, 2018: Hollister Place, Rockledge Apartments, Atera Apartments, Cedar Pointe, Crestmont Reserve and Brandywine I & II.\nDebt, Derivatives and Hedging Activity\nRental income. Rental income was $125.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $115.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $9.6 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The increase between the periods was also due to a 7.7% increase in the weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit in our Portfolio to $948 as of December 31, 2017 from $880 as of December 31, 2016, primarily driven by the value-add program that we have implemented and organic growth in rents in the markets where our properties are located, and an increase in the occupancy rate of our Portfolio of 0.4% to 93.8% as of December 31, 2017 from 93.4% as of December 31, 2016.\n (1) Included in loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. \nAcquisition costs. No acquisition costs were expensed for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired three properties and capitalized all acquisition costs incurred. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired four properties; we expensed the acquisition costs related to one acquisition and capitalized acquisition costs of approximately $0.7 million related to three acquisitions. Acquisition costs depend on the specific circumstances of each closing and are one-time costs associated with each acquisition. We believe most future acquisition costs will be capitalized.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our 2016-2018 Same Store properties were approximately 94.7% leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $945. As of December 31, 2017, our 2016-2018 Same Store properties were approximately 94.0% leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $904. For our 2016-2018 Same Store properties, we recorded the following operating results for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 property management fees payable to BH. \nThe following table sets forth a summary of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.7 million, or 7.0%. The majority of the increase is related to a $0.7 million, or 7.4%, increase in property taxes.\n2017-2018 Same Store Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe interest rate cap agreements generally have a term of three to four years, cover the outstanding principal amount of the underlying debt and are generally required by our lenders. Under the interest rate cap agreements, we pay a fixed fee in exchange for the counterparty to pay any interest above a maximum rate. As of December 31, 2018, interest rate cap agreements covered $255.2 million of our $808.0 million of floating rate mortgage debt outstanding. These interest rate cap agreements effectively cap one-month LIBOR on $255.2 million of our floating rate mortgage debt at a weighted average rate of 5.82%.\nCash flows from operating activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $41.7 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to an increase in total revenues, decreases in total property operating expenses, prepayment penalties and defeasance costs and debt modification and other extinguishment costs paid and changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nNOI and 2017-2018 Same Store NOI for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\n2017 Bridge Facility\nThe year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nRental income. Our earnings are primarily attributable to the rental revenue from our multifamily properties. We anticipate that the leases we enter into for our multifamily properties will typically be for one year or less on average.\nThe change in our net income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to a decrease in gain on sales of real estate, and was partially offset by an increase in total revenues and decreases in total property operating expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs. The change in our net income (loss) between the periods was also due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2017 and 2018 and the timing of the transactions (we acquired one property in the first quarter of 2017, one property in the second quarter of 2017, one property in the fourth quarter of 2017 and three properties in the third quarter of 2018; we sold four properties in the second quarter of 2017, five properties in the third quarter of 2017 and one property in the first quarter of 2018).\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and our historical results of operations. The following should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected, forecasted, or expected in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report. Our management believes the assumptions underlying the Company's financial statements and accompanying notes are reasonable. However, the Company's financial statements and accompanying notes may not be an indication of our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\n\n (1) Interest expense obligations includes the impact of expected settlements on interest rate swaps which have been entered into in order to fix the interest rate on the hedged portion of our floating rate debt obligations. As of December 31, 2018, we had entered into seven interest rate swap transactions with a combined notional amount of $650.0 million. We have allocated the total impact of expected settlements on the $650.0 million notional amount of interest rate swaps to \u2018Operating Properties Mortgage Debt.' We used one-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2018 to determine our expected settlements through the terms of the interest rate swaps. \nProperty management fees. Property management fees were $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.1 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to an increase in total revenues, which the fee is primarily based on.\nGain on sales of real estate. Gain on sales of real estate includes the gain recognized upon sales of properties. Gain on sales of real estate is calculated by deducting the carrying value of the real estate and costs incurred to sell the properties from the sales prices of the properties.\n (3) For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, excludes approximately $1,013,000 and $939,000, respectively, of expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on our behalf at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees. \nCore FFO makes certain adjustments to FFO, which are either not likely to occur on a regular basis or are otherwise not representative of the ongoing operating performance of our portfolio. Core FFO adjusts FFO to remove items such as acquisition expenses, losses on extinguishment of debt and modification costs (including prepayment penalties and defeasance costs incurred on the early repayment of debt, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and fair market value adjustments of assumed debt related to the early repayment of debt, costs incurred in a debt modification that are not capitalized as deferred financing costs and other costs incurred in a debt extinguishment), casualty-related expenses and recoveries, the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with obtaining short-term debt financing, the ineffective portion of fair value adjustments on interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (see Notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements), and the noncontrolling interests (as described above) related to these items. We believe Core FFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and is useful in comparing our operating performance with other REITs that are not as involved in the aforementioned activities.\nProperty management fees. Property management fees were $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.2 million, or 4.7%. The majority of the increase is related to a $4.3 million, or 5.1%, increase in rental income, and a $0.1 million, or 1.0%, increase in other income, which the fee is primarily based on.\nRevenues\nThe year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\n\nSee reconciliation of net income (loss) to NOI below under NOI and 2017-2018 Same Store NOI for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\u201d\nRevenue Recognition\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01\u201d), which changes certain recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The ASU requires all equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or resulting in consolidation, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also simplifies the impairment assessment for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, amends the presentation requirements for changes in the fair value of financial liabilities, requires presentation of financial instruments by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We will implement the provisions of ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as we do not, nor do we expect to, have a material amount of financial assets or financial liabilities that would be subject to the provisions of ASU 2016-01.\nOn September 26, 2018, we, through the OP, repaid the $30.0 million outstanding under the $30 Million Credit Facility and amended the loan agreement, extending the maturity date to September 26, 2020 and increasing the loan commitment to $60.0 million (the $60 Million Credit Facility\u201d). We, through the OP, immediately drew $50.0 million to fund a portion of the purchase price of Brandywine I & II and Crestmont Reserve.\nRental income. Rental income was $107.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $102.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $4.7 million, or 4.5%. The majority of the increase is related to a 4.1% increase in the weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit to $963 as of December 31, 2018 from $925 as of December 31, 2017, as well as a 0.6% increase in occupancy.\nWe define Same Store NOI\u201d as NOI for our properties that are comparable between periods. We view Same Store NOI as an important measure of the operating performance of our properties because it allows us to compare operating results of properties owned for the entirety of the current and comparable periods and therefore eliminates variations caused by acquisitions or dispositions during the periods.\n (4) For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, excludes approximately $(7,000) and $18,000, respectively, of casualty-related expenses/(recoveries). \nCorporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses were $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $2.3 million. The increase between periods primarily relates to $3.1 million of equity-based compensation expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the grants of restricted stock units to our directors and officers pursuant to our 2016 LTIP, compared to $0.8 million of equity-based compensation expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements). Subject to the Expense Cap, corporate general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods as we acquire additional properties.\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and existing cash balances. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $2.0 million of renovation value-add reserves for our planned capital expenditures to implement our value-add program. Renovation value-add reserves are not required to be held in escrow by a third party. We may reallocate these funds, at our discretion, to pursue other investment opportunities or meet our short-term liquidity requirements.\n \u2022 advisory and administrative fees payable to our Adviser; \nThe allocation of total consideration, which is determined using inputs that are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy established by FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements), is based on management's estimate of the property's as-if\u201d vacant fair value and is calculated by using all available information such as the replacement cost of such asset, appraisals, property condition reports, market data and other related information. The allocation of the total consideration to intangible lease assets represents the value associated with the in-place leases, which may include lost rent, leasing commissions, legal and other related costs, which we, as buyer of the property, did not have to incur to obtain the residents. If any debt is assumed in an acquisition, the difference between the fair value, which is estimated using inputs that are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and the face value of debt is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt assumed.\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses were $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $0.4 million, or 1.3%. The majority of the decrease is related to a $0.8 million, or 10.3%, decrease in utility costs, partially offset by a $0.3 million, or 2.4%, increase in labor costs.\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses were $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.7 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The increase between the periods was also due to a $1.0 million, or 8.8%, increase in repairs and maintenance costs, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in casualty recoveries.\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses were $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $0.1 million, or 0.1%.\nRevenues\nFFO was $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $31.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was a decrease of approximately $5.9 million. The change in our FFO between the periods primarily relates to increases in total property operating expenses of $4.0 million, interest expense of $9.4 million, loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs of $4.0 million and corporate general and administrative expenses of $2.3 million, partially offset by an increase in total revenues of $11.4 million and adjustments for amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) ( ASU 2017-12\u201d), which clarifies hedge accounting requirements, improves disclosure of hedging arrangements, and better aligns risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. We early adopted ASU 2017-12 on January 1, 2018, on a modified retrospective basis. For cash flow hedges existing as of the date of adoption, we eliminated the separate measurement of ineffectiveness by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated OCI with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated earnings less dividends on January 1, 2018. The cumulative-effect adjustment, which eliminated the cumulative ineffectiveness that was previously reported in interest expense, resulted in an increase to OCI of approximately $1.4 million, with a corresponding decrease to accumulated earnings less dividends.\nThe change in our net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to increases in total revenues and gain on sales of real estate, and was partially offset by increases in total property operating expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs. The change in our net income between the periods was also due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions (we acquired one property in the third quarter of 2016, three properties in the fourth quarter of 2016, one property in the first quarter of 2017, one property in the second quarter of 2017 and one property in the fourth quarter of 2017; we sold three properties in the second quarter of 2016, four properties in the third quarter of 2016, four properties in the second quarter of 2017 and five properties in the third quarter of 2017).\nWe believe that the use of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. While FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income (loss) as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO, Core FFO and AFFO do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO, Core FFO and AFFO reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define Core FFO or AFFO differently than we do.\nObligations and Commitments\nOverview\nProperty management fees. Property management fees were $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.1 million, or 4.3%. The majority of the increase is related to a $4.7 million, or 4.5%, increase in rental income, and a $0.5 million, or 2.8%, increase in other income, which the fee is primarily based on.\nGain on sales of real estate. Gain on sales of real estate was $78.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $52.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold nine properties; during the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold seven properties.\n (3) There were no existing deferred financing costs related to the prior fixed rate mortgage. We wrote-off the unamortized fair market value adjustment as of June 1, 2018, a premium of less than $0.1 million, related to the prior fixed rate mortgage, which is recorded in loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. \nIn order to obtain more favorable pricing on our mortgage debt financing with Freddie Mac, we have decided to participate in Freddie Mac's new Multifamily Green Advantage program (the Green Program\u201d). In the second quarter of 2017, we escrowed approximately $4.2 million to finance smarter, greener property improvements at 18 of our properties. In connection with the three acquisitions and seven refinancings we completed in 2018, we escrowed approximately $1.2 million related to the Green Program. Since the inception of the Green Program through December 31, 2018, we had spent approximately $2.5 million on green improvements and completed 17 Green Programs. We expect to spend approximately $1.1 million on green improvements in 2019. We expect to reduce water/sewer costs at each property where the Green Program is implemented by at least 15% through the replacement of showerheads, plumbing fixtures and toilets with modern energy efficient upgrades. In 2018, for the 17 properties where the Green Program was completed, this resulted in an estimated reduction of utility costs of approximately $1.4 million.\n (4) Previous mortgage was an assumed fixed-rate loan. \nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs were $48.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $13.2 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the amortization of intangible lease assets of $8.9 million related to seven properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.4 million related to five properties for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $7.5 million, as well as the acquisition of three properties subsequent to December 31, 2016. The amortization of intangible lease assets over a six-month period from the date of acquisition is expected to increase the amortization expense during the initial year of operations for each property. The increase between the periods was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense related to the disposition of nine properties subsequent to December 31, 2016.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, and expect to continue to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85% of our ordinary income, (2) 95% of our capital gain net income and (3) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. We believe we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs were $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $48.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $1.3 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to the amortization of intangible lease assets of $2.5 million related to four properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $8.9 million related to seven properties for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $6.4 million. The decrease between the periods was partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in depreciation expense, primarily due to our acquisition activity in 2017 and 2018 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The amortization of intangible lease assets over a six-month period from the date of acquisition is expected to increase the amortization expense during the initial year of operations for each property.\nInflation may also affect the overall cost of debt, as the implied cost of capital increases. Currently, interest rates are less than historical averages. However, the Federal Reserve, in response to or in anticipation of continued inflation concerns, could continue to raise interest rates. We intend to mitigate these risks through long-term fixed interest rate loans and interest rate hedges, which to date have included interest rate cap and interest rate swap agreements.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs primarily include depreciation of our multifamily properties and amortization of acquired in-place leases.\nRevenues\nExpenses\n (2) For previous floating rate mortgages, represents the reduction in the borrowing spread from the previous mortgage to the current mortgage. For previous fixed-rate mortgages, represents the reduction in the borrowing rate from the previous mortgage to the current mortgage (using one-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2018). \nThe following table sets forth a summary of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nCorporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses include, but are not limited to, audit fees, legal fees, listing fees, board of director fees, equity-based compensation expense, investor relations costs and payments of reimbursements to our Adviser for operating expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses and the advisory and administrative fees paid to our Adviser (including advisory and administrative fees on properties defined in the Advisory Agreement as New Assets) will not exceed 1.5% of Average Real Estate Assets per calendar year (or part thereof that the Advisory Agreement is in effect), calculated in accordance with the Advisory Agreement, or the Expense Cap. The Expense Cap does not limit the reimbursement by us of expenses related to securities offerings paid by our Adviser. The Expense Cap also does not apply to legal, accounting, financial, due diligence, and other service fees incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions, extraordinary litigation, or other events outside our ordinary course of business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of real estate assets.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We may elect to comply with public company effective dates at any time, and such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. The following recent accounting pronouncements reflect effective dates that delay the adoption until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nUpon acquisition of a property, the purchase price and related acquisition costs ( total consideration\u201d) are allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and intangible lease assets in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations, and ASU 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business (Topic 805) ( ASU 2017-01\u201d), which we early adopted on October 1, 2016. We believe most future acquisition costs will be capitalized in accordance with ASU 2017-01. Prior to our adoption of ASU 2017-01, acquisition costs were expensed as incurred.\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses include property maintenance costs, salary and employee benefit costs, utilities, casualty-related expenses and recoveries and other property operating costs.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses were $35.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $3.1 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2017 and 2018 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The decrease between the periods was also due to a $1.5 million, or 13.5%, decrease in utility costs and a $0.8 million, or 4.8%, decrease in labor costs.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCapital Expenditures and Value-Add Program\n (1) Prior to our adoption of ASU 2017-12 on January 1, 2018, the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was recognized directly in net income (loss) as interest expense. The adoption of ASU 2017-12 eliminates the separate measurement of effectiveness and ineffectiveness, and all changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded directly in OCI. See Notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. \nAs of December 31, 2017, our 2016-2018 Same Store properties were approximately 94.0% leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $904. As of December 31, 2016, our 2016-2018 Same Store properties were approximately 93.7% leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $865. For our 2016-2018 Same Store properties, we recorded the following operating results for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016:\nRental income. Rental income was $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $79.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $5.0 million, or 6.2%. The majority of the increase is related to a 4.5% increase in the weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit to $904 as of December 31, 2017 from $865 as of December 31, 2016, as well as a 0.3% increase in occupancy.\nFreddie Mac Multifamily Green Advantage\nOther Income and Expense\nThe following table reconciles our calculations of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nAFFO makes certain adjustments to Core FFO in order to arrive at a more refined measure of the operating performance of our portfolio. There is no industry standard definition of AFFO and practice is divergent across the industry. AFFO adjusts Core FFO to remove items such as equity-based compensation expense and the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with obtaining long-term debt financing, and the noncontrolling interests (as described above) related to these items. We believe AFFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and is useful in comparing our operating performance with other REITs that are not as involved in the aforementioned activities.\nCash flows from investing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by investing activities was $2.3 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $51.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flows from investing activities was mainly due to the acquisition of three properties for a combined purchase price of approximately $197.2 million during the period in 2017, compared to the acquisition of four properties for a combined purchase price of approximately $175.1 million during the period in 2016. The change in cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from sales of real estate; we sold nine properties for net proceeds of approximately $224.4 million during the period in 2017, compared to selling seven properties for net proceeds of approximately $131.8 million during the period in 2016.\nWe recognize our tax positions and evaluate them using a two-step process. First, we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Second, we will determine the amount of benefit to recognize and record the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nOther Income and Expense\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, our 2017-2018 Same Store properties were approximately 94.5% leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $963. As of December 31, 2017, our 2017-2018 Same Store properties were approximately 93.9% leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $925. For our 2017-2018 Same Store properties, we recorded the following operating results for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017:\nThe cost of funds is eliminated from net income (loss) because it is specific to our particular financing capabilities and constraints. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital, which may have changed or may change in the future. Acquisition costs and non-operating fees to affiliates are eliminated because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our multifamily properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale, which will usually change from period to period. Casualty-related expenses and recoveries are excluded because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. Entity level general and administrative expenses incurred at the properties are eliminated as they are specific to the way in which we have chosen to hold our properties and are the result of our ownership structuring. Also, expenses that are incurred upon acquisition of a property do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these items from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual ongoing revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nFurthermore, following the completion of our value-add and capital expenditures programs and depending on the interest rate environment at the applicable time, we may seek to refinance our floating rate debt into longer-term fixed rate debt at lower leverage levels.\nIn order to fix a portion of, and mitigate the risk associated with, our floating rate indebtedness (without incurring substantial prepayment penalties or defeasance costs typically associated with fixed rate indebtedness when repaid early or refinanced), we, through the OP, have entered into seven interest rate swap transactions with KeyBank (the Counterparty\u201d) with a combined notional amount of $650.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, the interest rate swaps we have entered into effectively replace the floating interest rate (one-month LIBOR) with respect to $650.0 million of our floating rate mortgage debt outstanding with a weighted average fixed rate of 1.3388%. During the term of these interest rate swap agreements, we are required to make monthly fixed rate payments of 1.3388%, on a weighted average basis, on the notional amounts, while the Counterparty is obligated to make monthly floating rate payments based on one-month LIBOR to us referencing the same notional amounts. For purposes of hedge accounting under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 815, Derivatives and Hedging, we have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. See Notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We may elect to comply with public company effective dates at any time, and such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.\n (5) For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, excludes approximately $441,000, $370,000 and $283,000, respectively, of expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on our behalf at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees. \nReal estate assets, including land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and intangible lease assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized at cost.\nOn December 29, 2016, we, through the OP, entered into a $30.0 million credit facility (the $30 Million Credit Facility\u201d) with KeyBank. On April 27, 2018, we, through the OP, amended the $30 Million Credit Facility to temporarily increase the loan commitment by $5.0 million (the Temporary Increase\u201d) and immediately drew $5.0 million. The $5.0 million drawn under the Temporary Increase was repaid in full on July 25, 2018.\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses include the costs of marketing, professional fees, general office supplies, and other administrative related costs of each property.\nOur primary operations consist of rental income earned from our residents under lease agreements typically with terms of one year or less. Rental income is recognized when earned. This policy effectively results in income recognition on the straight-line method over the related terms of the leases. Resident reimbursements and other income consist of charges billed to residents for utilities, carport and garage rental, and pets, administrative, application and other fees and are recognized when earned.\nCash flows from investing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $137.0 million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in cash flows from investing activities was mainly due to a decrease in net proceeds from sales of real estate. We sold one property for net proceeds of approximately $29.6 million during the period in 2018; we sold nine properties for net proceeds of approximately $224.4 million during the period in 2017. The change in cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by the acquisition of three properties for a combined purchase price of approximately $131.0 million during the period in 2018 compared to the acquisition of three properties for a combined purchase price of approximately $197.2 million during the period in 2017.\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes include the property taxes assessed by local and state authorities depending on the location of each property. Insurance includes the cost of commercial, general liability, and other needed insurance for each property.\nOn November 14, 2018, in connection with the 2018 Offering, we issued 2,702,500 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a public offering price of $33.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $84.8 million (after underwriters' discounts and offering costs). We contributed the net proceeds from the 2018 Offering to the OP in exchange for 2,702,500 OP Units, and the OP in turn used a majority of the net proceeds to repay the $50.0 million outstanding under the $60 Million Credit Facility and the $30.0 million outstanding under the $30 Million Bridge Facility (see Notes 6 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements).\nNon-GAAP Measurements\n2016-2018 Same Store Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nHowever, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes corporate general and administrative expenses, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs, acquisition costs, certain fees to affiliates such as advisory and administrative fees, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as determined under GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income, which further limits its usefulness.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for debt maturities, operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our multifamily properties, including:\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $1.0 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to an increase in gain recognized related to the effective portion of changes in fair value of our interest rate swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of approximately $5.3 million (see Debt, Derivatives and Hedging Activity - Interest Rate Swap Agreements\u201d below). The decrease between the periods was partially offset by an increase in interest on debt of approximately $4.6 million. The following table details the various costs included in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $9.4 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to an increase in interest on debt and a reduction in gain recognized related to the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of our interest rate swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (see Debt, Derivatives and Hedging Activity - Interest Rate Swap Agreements\u201d below), as shown in the table below. The following table details the various costs included in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nCash flows from financing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $95.1 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in cash flows from financing activities was mainly due to receiving net proceeds of approximately $84.8 million in the 2018 Offering and a net increase in debt of approximately $14.1 million between the periods, partially offset by increases in common stock repurchases of approximately $7.2 million and common stock dividends paid of approximately $3.0 million between the periods and the $51.7 million purchase amount of the purchase of 100% of the joint venture interests in our Portfolio owned by BH Equities, LLC\n (2) Fees incurred to an unaffiliated third party that is an affiliate of the noncontrolling limited partner of the OP. \nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses were $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.3 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The increase between the periods was also due to a $0.3 million, or 24.4%, increase in advertising and promotional costs.\nThe year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\n\nOther income. Other income was $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $1.4 million, or 11.1%. The majority of the increase is related to a $0.8 million, or 11.8%, increase in utility reimbursements and a $0.4 million, or 77.1%, increase in other resident charges.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs. Loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs includes prepayment penalties and defeasance costs, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and fair market value adjustments of assumed debt related to the early repayment of debt, costs incurred in a debt modification that are not capitalized as deferred financing costs and other costs incurred in a debt extinguishment.\nNOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in -Results of Operations\u201d regarding the components of net income (loss) that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.\nExpenses\n \u2022 reimbursements to our Adviser; and \n\n \u2022 interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness (see -Obligations and Commitments\u201d below); \n (1) Prior to our adoption of ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) ( ASU 2017-12\u201d) on January 1, 2018, the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was recognized directly in net income (loss) as interest expense. The adoption of ASU 2017-12 eliminates the separate measurement of effectiveness and ineffectiveness, and all changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded directly in other comprehensive income ( OCI\u201d). See Notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n (1) Includes total capital expenditures during the period on completed and in-progress interior rehabs. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we completed full and partial interior rehabs on 1,432, 1,588 and 1,812 units, respectively. \n (3) For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, excludes approximately $853,000, $760,000 and $596,000, respectively, of expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on our behalf at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees. \n\nAFFO was $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $1.2 million. The change in our AFFO between the periods primarily relates to an increase in equity-based compensation expense of $2.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in Core FFO.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs. Loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs was $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $4.0 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to increases in prepayment penalties and defeasance costs of approximately $1.9 million and debt modification and other extinguishment costs of approximately $1.8 million. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we sold nine properties and seven properties, respectively. The following table details the various costs included in loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses were $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $0.3 million, or 1.0%. The majority of the decrease is related to a $0.8 million, or 8.8%, decrease in utility costs, partially offset by a $0.3 million, or 2.5%, increase in labor costs.\n (1) For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, excludes approximately $(664,000), $(318,000) and $56,000, respectively, of casualty-related expenses/(recoveries). \n (1) For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, excludes approximately $656,000 and $305,000, respectively, of casualty-related recoveries. \nLoss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs. Loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs was $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $2.1 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to decreases in debt modification and other extinguishment costs of approximately $1.5 million and prepayment penalties and defeasance costs of approximately $1.0 million. The following table details the various costs included in loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nGain on sales of real estate. Gain on sales of real estate was $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $78.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $64.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold one property; during the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold nine properties.\n (4) For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, excludes approximately $1,000, $31,000 and $95,000, respectively, of casualty-related expenses. \nWe anticipate incurring average annual repairs and maintenance expense of $575 to $725 per apartment unit in connection with the ongoing operations of our business. These expenditures are expensed as incurred. In addition, we reserve, on average, approximately $250 to $350 per apartment unit for non-recurring capital expenditures and/or lender required replacement reserves. When incurred, these expenditures are either capitalized or expensed, in accordance with GAAP, depending on the type of the expenditure. Although we will continuously monitor the adequacy of this average, we believe these figures to be sufficient to maintain the properties at a high level in the markets in which we operate. A majority of the properties in our Portfolio were underwritten and acquired with the premise that we would invest $4,000 to $10,000 per unit in the first 36 months of ownership, in an effort to add value to the asset's exterior and interiors. In most cases, we reserved cash at closing to fund these planned capital expenditures and value-add improvements. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $2.0 million of renovation value-add reserves for our planned capital expenditures and other expenses to implement our value-add program, which will complete approximately 325 planned interior rehabs. The following table sets forth a summary of our capital expenditures related to our value-add program for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\n (1) The floating rate option for the interest rate swaps is one-month LIBOR. As of December 31, 2018, one-month LIBOR was 2.5027%. \nAdvisory and administrative fees. Advisory and administrative fees include the fees paid to our Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement (see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements).\nProperty management fees. Property management fees were $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.3 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to increases in rental income and other income, which the fee is primarily based on.\nFFO, Core FFO and AFFO\nThe real estate market has not been affected significantly by inflation in the past several years due to a relatively low inflation rate. The majority of our lease terms are for a period of one year or less and reset to market if renewed. The majority of our leases also contain protection provisions applicable to reimbursement billings for utilities. Should inflation return, due to the short-term nature of our leases, we do not believe our results will be materially affected.\nAcquisition costs. Acquisition costs include the costs to acquire additional properties. On October 1, 2016, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-01, which requires an entity to capitalize acquisition costs associated with an acquisition that is determined to be an acquisition of an asset as opposed to an acquisition of a business. Prior to our adoption of ASU 2017-01, acquisition costs were expensed as incurred. We believe most future acquisition costs will be capitalized in accordance with ASU 2017-01.\nThe year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nOn January 28, 2019, we, through the OP, entered into a $75.0 million credit facility (the $75 Million Credit Facility\u201d) with SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto, and immediately drew $52.5 million to fund a portion of the purchase price of three properties we acquired on January 28, 2019. The $75 Million Credit Facility is a full-term, interest-only facility with an initial 24-month term, has one 12-month extension option, bears interest at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus a range from 2.00% to 2.50%, depending on our leverage level as determined under the credit facility agreement, and is guaranteed by us. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses were $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.1 million, or 2.7%.\nIn addition to our value-add program, our multifamily properties will require periodic capital expenditures and renovation to remain competitive. Also, acquisitions, redevelopments, or expansions of our multifamily properties will require significant capital outlays. Long-term, we may not be able to fund such capital improvements solely from net cash provided by operations because we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deductions for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT, and we are subject to tax on any retained income and gains. As a result, our ability to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, or redevelopment through retained earnings long-term is limited. Consequently, we expect to rely heavily upon the availability of debt or equity capital for these purposes. If we are unable to obtain the necessary capital on favorable terms, or at all, our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRental income. Rental income was $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $4.3 million, or 5.1%. The majority of the increase is related to a 4.5% increase in the weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit to $945 as of December 31, 2018 from $904 as of December 31, 2017, as well as a 0.7% increase in occupancy.\n \u2022 distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT; \nSince the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges. We compute FFO attributable to common stockholders in accordance with NAREIT's definition. Our presentation differs slightly in that we begin with net income (loss) before adjusting for amounts attributable to (1) noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint ventures and (2) redeemable noncontrolling interests in the OP and we show the combined amounts attributable to such noncontrolling interests as an adjustment to arrive at FFO attributable to common stockholders.\nInflation\nExpenses\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\n \u2022 general and administrative expenses; \nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity should also disclose sufficient quantitative and qualitative information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date, which amends ASU 2014-09 to defer the effective date by one year. The new standard is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities are allowed to use either the full or modified retrospective approach when transitioning to the ASU. We will implement the provisions of ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a substantial portion of our revenue consists of rental income from leasing arrangements, which is specifically excluded from ASU 2014-09.\n\nIn August 2018, the SEC adopted SEC Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification (the SEC Release\u201d), which amends certain disclosure requirements that were redundant, duplicative, overlapping or superseded by other SEC disclosure requirements or GAAP. The amendments generally eliminated or otherwise reduced certain disclosure requirements of various SEC rules and regulations. However, in some cases, the amendments require additional information to be disclosed, including changes in stockholders' equity in interim periods. Under the SEC Release, registrants will be required to disclose in interim periods on Form 10-Q the changes in each caption of stockholders' equity and noncontrolling interests for the current and comparative year-to-date periods, with subtotals for each interim period and the amount of dividends per share for each class of shares. The amendments require registrants, including smaller reporting companies, to provide information as prescribed by Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X. Therefore, the interim disclosures of changes in stockholders' equity, including dividends per share amounts, may be given in a note to the financial statements or in a separate financial statement. Under Rule 3-04, the interim disclosures of the changes in stockholders' equity should be in the form of a reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance for each period for which an income statement is required to be filed, with all significant reconciling items described by appropriate captions. The reconciliation should also reflect any adjustments to the balance at the beginning of the earliest period presented for items retroactively applied to periods prior to that period. We adopted the provisions of the SEC Release on September 30, 2018, on a retrospective basis.\nThe following table, which has not been adjusted for the effects of noncontrolling interests, reconciles our NOI and our 2016-2018 Same Store NOI for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (in thousands):\n (2) Adjustment to net income (loss) to exclude certain property general and administrative expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on our behalf at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees. \nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses were $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $1.1 million, or 4.3%. The majority of the increase is related to a $0.9 million, or 11.6%, increase in repairs and maintenance costs.\nAFFO was $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $6.0 million. The change in our AFFO between the periods primarily relates to increases in Core FFO and equity-based compensation expense of $1.1 million.\nWe will make dividend payments based on our estimate of taxable earnings per share of common stock, but not earnings calculated pursuant to GAAP. Our dividends and taxable income and GAAP earnings will typically differ due to items such as depreciation and amortization, fair value adjustments, differences in premium amortization and discount accretion, and non-deductible general and administrative expenses. Our quarterly dividends per share may be substantially different than our quarterly taxable earnings and GAAP earnings per share. Our Board declared our fourth quarterly dividend of 2018 of $0.275 per share on October 29, 2018, which was paid on December 31, 2018 and funded out of cash flows from operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our Portfolio consisted of 35 multifamily properties primarily located in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States encompassing 12,555 units of apartment space that was approximately 94.6% leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $985. Substantially all of our business is conducted through the OP. We own the Portfolio through the OP and our TRS. The OP owns approximately 99.9% of the Portfolio; our TRS owns approximately 0.1% of the Portfolio. The OP GP is the sole general partner of the OP. As of December 31, 2018, there were 23,819,402 OP Units outstanding, of which 23,746,169, or 99.7%, were owned by us and 73,233, or 0.3%, were owned by an unaffiliated limited partner (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements).\nDividends\nOn June 30, 2017, we, through the OP, entered into a $65.9 million bridge facility (the 2017 Bridge Facility\u201d) with KeyBank. The 2017 Bridge Facility was a full-term, interest-only facility with an initial four-month term. The 2017 Bridge Facility was guaranteed by us. Interest accrued on the 2017 Bridge Facility at an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 3.75%. In July 2017, we used proceeds from the sale of Regatta Bay to pay down $11.3 million on the 2017 Bridge Facility. In October 2017, we used proceeds from the sale of four properties to pay down $46.0 million on the 2017 Bridge Facility, bringing the outstanding principal balance to $8.6 million, and also extended the maturity date to March 31, 2018. In February 2018, we used proceeds from the sale of Timberglen to pay the remaining $8.6 million outstanding on the 2017 Bridge Facility, which retired the bridge facility. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nExpenses\nCorporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses were $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $1.5 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to approximately $4.2 million of equity-based compensation expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the grants of restricted stock units to our directors, officers, employees and certain key employees of our Adviser pursuant to our long-term incentive plan (the 2016 LTIP\u201d), compared to $3.1 million of equity-based compensation expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements). Subject to the Expense Cap, corporate general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods as we acquire additional properties.\nNet Operating Income for Our 2016-2018 Same Store and Non-Same Store Properties for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.6 million, or 3.7%. The majority of the increase is related to a $0.4 million, or 3.2%, increase in property taxes.\nWe had no material unrecognized tax benefit or expense, accrued interest or penalties as of December 31, 2018. We and our subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax as well as income tax of various state and local jurisdictions. The 2017, 2016 and 2015 tax years remain open to examination by tax jurisdictions to which our subsidiaries and we are subject. When applicable, we recognize interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income. Other income was $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $0.6 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2017 and 2018 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The decrease between the periods was also due to a $0.7 million, or 6.0%, decrease in utility reimbursements.\nThe following table contains summary information regarding our outstanding interest rate swaps (dollars in thousands):\nOther income. Other income includes ancillary income earned from tenants such as application fees, late fees, laundry fees, utility reimbursements, and other rental related fees charged to tenants.\nAdvisory and administrative fees. Advisory and administrative fees were $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.6 million. The amount incurred during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 represents the maximum fee allowed on properties defined as Contributed Assets under the Advisory Agreement plus approximately $2.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, of advisory and administrative fees incurred on certain properties defined as New Assets. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Adviser elected to voluntarily waive the advisory and administrative fees incurred on the five properties we acquired subsequent to October 2016, which totaled approximately $2.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our Adviser elected to voluntarily waive the advisory and administrative fees incurred on the two properties we acquired subsequent to October 2016, which totaled less than $0.1 million. The advisory and administrative fees waived by our Adviser for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are considered to be permanently waived for the periods. Our Adviser is not contractually obligated to waive fees on New Assets in the future and may cease waiving fees on New Assets at its discretion. Advisory and administrative fees may increase in future periods as we acquire additional properties, which will be classified as New Assets.\n (1) Adjustment to net income (loss) to exclude certain property operating expenses that are casualty-related recoveries. \nWe began operations on March 31, 2015 as a result of the transfer and contribution by NHF of all but one of the multifamily properties owned by NHF through its wholly owned subsidiary NREO in exchange for 100% of its outstanding common stock. We use the term predecessor\u201d to mean the carve-out business of NREO, which owned all or a majority interest in the multifamily properties transferred or contributed to us by NHF through NREO. On March 31, 2015, NHF distributed all of the outstanding shares of our common stock held by NHF to holders of NHF common shares. We refer to the distribution of our common stock by NHF as the Spin-Off.\u201d Substantially all of our operations were conducted by our predecessor prior to March 31, 2015. With the exception of a nominal amount of initial cash funded at inception, we did not own any assets prior to March 31, 2015. Our predecessor included all of the properties in our Portfolio that were held indirectly by NREO prior to the Spin-Off. Our predecessor was determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. References throughout this report to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d or our,\u201d include the activity of the predecessor defined above.\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $1.5 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to a $1.5 million, or 9.4%, increase in property taxes. Property taxes incurred in the first year of ownership may be significantly less than subsequent years since the purchase price of the property may trigger a significant increase in assessed value by the taxing authority in subsequent years, increasing the cost of real estate taxes.\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses were $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $0.1 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2017 and 2018 and the timing of the transactions, as described above.\nThere are 25 properties encompassing 8,567 units of apartment space in our same store pool for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (our 2016-2018 Same Store\u201d properties). Our 2016-2018 Same Store properties exclude the following 10 properties in our Portfolio as of December 31, 2018: Parc500, The Colonnade, Old Farm, Stone Creek at Old Farm, Hollister Place, Rockledge Apartments, Atera Apartments, Cedar Pointe, Crestmont Reserve and Brandywine I & II.\n (1) Adjustment to net income (loss) to exclude certain property operating expenses that are casualty-related expenses/(recoveries). \nRevenues\n\nCore FFO was $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was a decrease of approximately $1.4 million. The change in our Core FFO between the periods primarily relates to a decrease in FFO and a decrease in gain recognized related to the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of our interest rate swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of $1.4 million, partially offset by an increase in loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs of $4.0 million and adjustments for amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nOther income. Other income was $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.1 million, or 1.0%. The majority of the increase is related to a $0.3 million, or 8.1%, increase in administrative and application fees, partially offset by a $0.1 million, or 2.0%, decrease in utility reimbursements.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nExpenses\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $3.1 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The increase between the periods was also due to a $2.8 million, or 20.3%, increase in property taxes and a $0.3 million, or 13.6%, increase in property liability insurance. Property taxes incurred in the first year of ownership may be significantly less than subsequent years since the purchase price of the property may trigger a significant increase in assessed value by the taxing authority in subsequent years, increasing the cost of real estate taxes.\nOther income. Other income was $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.5 million, or 2.8%. The majority of the increase is related to a $0.4 million, or 9.6%, increase in administrative and application fees.\n$60 Million Credit Facility", "item_7_text": "NOI and 2016-2018 Same Store NOI for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\n$30 Million Bridge Facility\n\nThe effect of the conversion of OP Units held by noncontrolling limited partners is not reflected in the computation of basic and diluted FFO, Core FFO and AFFO per share, as they are exchangeable for common stock on a one-for-one basis. The FFO, Core FFO and AFFO allocable to such units is allocated on this same basis and reflected in the adjustments for noncontrolling interests in the table below. As such, the assumed conversion of these units would have no net impact on the determination of diluted FFO, Core FFO and AFFO per share. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nFFO was $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $6.9 million. The change in our FFO between the periods primarily relates to an increase in total revenues of $2.4 million and decreases in total property operating expenses of $1.4 million, interest expense of $1.0 million and loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs of $2.1 million, partially offset by an increase in corporate general and administrative expenses of $1.5 million and adjustments for amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses were $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.1 million, or 0.7%.\nWe have entered into and expect to continue to enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements with various third parties to fix or cap the floating interest rates on a majority of our floating rate mortgage debt outstanding. The interest rate swap agreements generally have a term of four to five years and effectively establish a fixed interest rate on debt on the underlying notional amounts. The interest rate swap agreements involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. As of December 31, 2018, interest rate swap agreements effectively covered $650.0 million, or 80%, of our $808.0 million of floating rate mortgage debt outstanding.\n \u2022 recurring maintenance necessary to maintain our multifamily properties; \nThe following table presents selected data from our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nREIT Tax Election\nOther income. Other income was $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $1.8 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The increase between the periods was also due to a $1.1 million, or 11.3%, increase in utility reimbursements and a $0.5 million, or 56.1%, increase in other resident charges.\n (2) Represents the weighted average fixed rate of the interest rate swaps. \nCash flows from financing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $51.8 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flows from financing activities was mainly due to a net decrease in debt of approximately $13.9 million between the periods and the $51.7 million purchase amount of the BH Buyout during the period in 2017.\nWe account for subsidiary partnerships, joint ventures and other similar entities in which we hold an ownership interest in accordance with FASB ASC 810, Consolidation. We first evaluate whether each entity is a VIE. Under the VIE model, we consolidate an entity when we have control to direct the activities of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Under the voting model, we consolidate an entity when we control the entity through ownership of a majority voting interest. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of us and our subsidiaries, including the OP and its subsidiaries.\nand its affiliates (collectively, BH Equity\u201d) (the BH Buyout\u201d) during the period in 2017 (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements).\nWe anticipate that we will continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and we intend to continue to be organized and to operate in a manner that will permit us to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85% of our ordinary income, (2) 95% of our capital gain net income and (3) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nOn September 26, 2018, we, through the OP, entered into a $30.0 million bridge facility (the $30 Million Bridge Facility\u201d) with KeyBank and immediately drew $30.0 million to fund a portion of the purchase price of Brandywine I & II and Crestmont Reserve. The $30 Million Bridge Facility was a full-term, interest-only facility with a six-month term and was guaranteed by us. Interest accrued on the $30 Million Bridge Facility at an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2.00%. In November 2018, we, through the OP, used net proceeds from the 2018 Offering to repay the $30.0 million outstanding under the $30 Million Bridge Facility, which retired the bridge facility. In connection with the repayment, we, through the OP, received a commitment fee rebate of approximately $0.3 million from KeyBank, which was previously capitalized as a deferred financing cost on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2018. See Notes 5, 6 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nWe believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. We also believe that funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), core funds from operations ( Core FFO\u201d) and adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO\u201d) are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT.\nAlthough we expect to be subject to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, we expect that we will be able to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness for acquisitions or other purposes, if needed. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness or access additional sources of capital, such as by issuing common stock or other debt or equity securities, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.8 million, or 6.8%. The majority of the increase is related to a $0.7 million, or 6.8%, increase in property taxes.\nAdvisory and administrative fees. Advisory and administrative fees were $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.1 million. The amount incurred during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 represents the maximum fee allowed on properties defined as Contributed Assets under the Advisory Agreement plus approximately $2.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively, of advisory and administrative fees incurred on certain properties defined as New Assets. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Adviser elected to voluntarily waive the advisory and administrative fees incurred on the eight properties we acquired subsequent to October 2016, which totaled approximately $4.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Adviser elected to voluntarily waive the advisory and administrative fees incurred on the five properties we acquired subsequent to October 2016, which totaled approximately $2.4 million. The advisory and administrative fees waived by our Adviser for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are considered to be permanently waived for the periods. Our Adviser is not contractually obligated to waive fees on New Assets in the future and may cease waiving fees on New Assets at its discretion. Advisory and administrative fees may increase in future periods as we acquire additional properties, which will be classified as New Assets.\nWe could remain an emerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of becoming a public company, (2) the last day of the first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more, (3) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million, measured as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months) or (4) the date on which we have, during the preceding three year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt.\nRental income. Rental income was $128.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $125.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $3.0 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2017 and 2018 and the timing of the transactions, as described above, and a 3.9% increase in the weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit in our Portfolio to $985 as of December 31, 2018 from $948 as of December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the value-add program that we have implemented and organic growth in rents in the markets where our properties are located. The increase between the periods was also due to an increase in the occupancy rate of our Portfolio of 0.8% to 94.6% as of December 31, 2018 from 93.8% as of December 31, 2017.\n\nNet Operating Income and Same Store Net Operating Income\nWe evaluate the accounting and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d (greater than 50 percent probability) of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Our management is required to analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all major jurisdictions, which include federal and certain states. We have no examinations in progress and none are expected at this time.\nReal estate assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In such cases, we will evaluate the recoverability of such real estate assets based on estimated future cash flows and the estimated liquidation value of such real estate assets, and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the real estate asset. If impaired, the real estate asset will be written down to its estimated fair value.\n\n2016-2018 Same Store Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases - Targeted Improvements ( ASU 2018-11\u201d), which provides entities with relief from the costs of implementing certain aspects of ASU 2016-02. The ASU provides a practical expedient which allows lessors to not separate lease and non-lease components in a contract and allocate the consideration in the contract to the separate components if both (i) the timing and pattern of revenue recognition for the non-lease component and the related lease component are the same and (ii) the combined single lease component would be classified as an operating lease. We intend to elect the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component in lease contracts where we are the lessor. The ASU also provides a transition option that permits entities to not recast the comparative periods presented when transitioning to the standard. We also intend to elect the transition option.\nWe intend to invest in additional multifamily properties as suitable opportunities arise and adequate sources of equity and debt financing are available. We expect that future investments in properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed by, in whole or in part, our existing cash, future borrowings and the proceeds from additional issuances of common stock or other securities or property dispositions.\nRevenues\nWe are primarily focused on directly or indirectly acquiring, owning, and operating well-located multifamily properties with a value-add component in large cities and suburban submarkets of large cities, primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States. We generate revenue primarily by leasing our multifamily properties. We intend to employ targeted management and a value-add program at a majority of our properties in an attempt to improve rental rates and the NOI at our properties and achieve long-term capital appreciation for our stockholders. We are externally managed by the Adviser through the Advisory Agreement, by and among the OP, the Adviser and us. The Advisory Agreement was renewed on February 13, 2019 for a one-year term set to expire on March 16, 2020. The Adviser is wholly owned by NexPoint Advisors, L.P., which is an affiliate of our Sponsor.\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing taxable income. Any resulting corporate liability could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.\nSee reconciliation of net income (loss) to NOI below under NOI and 2016-2018 Same Store NOI for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\u201d\nWe intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85% of our ordinary income, (2) 95% of our capital gain net income and (3) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. We intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments of all or substantially all of our taxable income to holders of our common stock out of assets legally available for this purpose, if and to the extent authorized by our Board. Before we make any dividend payments, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or raise additional capital to make cash dividends or we may make a portion of the required dividend in the form of a taxable distribution of stock or debt securities.\n (2) Indicates coverage ratio of FFO/Core FFO/AFFO per common share (diluted) over dividends declared per common share during the period. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nComponents of Our Revenues and Expenses\nRefinancings. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we refinanced mortgages on seven properties, as detailed in the table below (dollars in thousands). See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe following table reflects the revenues, property operating expenses and NOI for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 for our 2016-2018 Same Store and Non-Same Store properties (dollars in thousands):\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate these judgments, assumptions and estimates for changes that would affect the reported amounts. These estimates are based on management's historical industry experience and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these judgments, assumptions and estimates. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.\n (5) For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, excludes approximately $281,000 and $191,000, respectively, of expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on our behalf at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees. \nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which supersedes the current accounting for leases and while retaining two distinct types of leases, finance and operating, (1) requires lessees to record a right of use asset and a related liability for the rights and obligations associated with a lease, regardless of lease classification, and recognize lease expense in a manner similar to current accounting, (2) eliminates most real estate specific lease provisions and (3) aligns many of the underlying lessor model principles with those in the new revenue standard. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach when transitioning to the ASU for leases that exist as of or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We expect to implement the provisions of ASU 2016-02 as of January 1, 2020. As lessors, substantially all of our agreements have a term of 12 months or less. Based on a preliminary assessment, we expect most of our operating leases will be subject to the new guidance and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption, resulting in an immaterial increase in the assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We are continuing our evaluation, which may identify additional impacts this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNet Operating Income for Our 2017-2018 Same Store and Non-Same Store Properties for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\n\n \u2022 capital expenditures to continue our value-add program and to improve the quality and performance of our multifamily properties; \nWe believe that our available cash, expected operating cash flows, and potential debt or equity financings will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated scheduled debt service payments and dividend requirements for the twelve-month period following December 31, 2018.\nExpenses\nInterest expense. Interest expense primarily includes the cost of interest expense on debt, the amortization of deferred financing costs and the related impact of interest rate derivatives used to manage our interest rate risk.\nThe year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nCash flows from operating activities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $37.5 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to an increase in total revenues, partially offset by increases in total property operating expenses, interest on debt, prepayment penalties and defeasance costs and debt modification and other extinguishment costs paid and changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nThe $60 Million Credit Facility was a full-term, interest-only facility with a 24-month term and was guaranteed by us. Interest accrued on the $60 Million Credit Facility at an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2.00%. In November 2018, we, through the OP, used net proceeds from the 2018 Offering to repay the $50.0 million outstanding under the $60 Million Credit Facility, which retired the credit facility. In connection with the repayment, we, through the OP, received a commitment fee rebate of approximately $0.8 million from KeyBank, which was previously capitalized as a deferred financing cost on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2018. See Notes 5, 6 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nProperty management fees. Property management fees were $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.1 million, or 6.9%. The majority of the increase is related to a $5.0 million, or 6.2%, increase in rental income, and a $1.3 million, or 11.1%, increase in other income, which the fee is primarily based on.\n (2) Adjustment to net income (loss) to exclude certain property general and administrative expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on our behalf at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees. \nRevenues\nCore FFO was $35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $5.0 million. The change in our Core FFO between the periods primarily relates to an increase in FFO, partially offset by a decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs of $2.1 million and adjustments for amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n\n (2) Fees incurred to an unaffiliated third party that is an affiliate of the noncontrolling limited partner of the OP. \n (5) Represents the weighted average reduction in the borrowing spreads. \nThe following table, which has not been adjusted for the effects of noncontrolling interests, reconciles our NOI and our 2017-2018 Same Store NOI for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (in thousands):\nMortgage Debt\nIncome Taxes\nProperty management fees. Property management fees include fees paid to BH, our property manager, or other third party management companies for managing each property (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements).\n$75 Million Credit Facility\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018 for the next five calendar years subsequent to December 31, 2018. We used one-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2018 to calculate interest expense due by period on our floating rate debt and net interest expense due by period on our interest rate swaps.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional multifamily properties, renovations and other capital expenditures to improve our multifamily properties and scheduled debt payments and distributions. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, which may include a revolving credit facility and future debt or equity issuances, existing working capital, net cash provided by operations, long-term mortgage indebtedness and other secured and unsecured borrowings, and property dispositions. However, there are a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including the state of overall equity and credit markets, our degree of leverage, our unencumbered asset base and borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders (including as a result of any failure to comply with financial covenants in our existing and future indebtedness), general market conditions for REITs, our operating performance and liquidity, market perceptions about us and restrictions on sales of properties under the Code. The success of our business strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to access these various capital sources.\nNOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties to other comparable properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as NOI is not affected by (1) the cost of funds, (2) acquisition costs, (3) advisory and administrative fees, (4) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, (5) corporate general and administrative expenses, (6) other gains and losses that are specific to us, (7) casualty-related expenses/(recoveries) and (8) property general and administrative expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on our behalf at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our subsidiaries had aggregate mortgage debt outstanding to third parties of approximately $845.7 million at a weighted average interest rate of 4.07% and an adjusted weighted average interest rate of 3.17%. For purposes of calculating the adjusted weighted average interest rate of our mortgage debt outstanding, we have included the weighted average fixed rate of 1.3388% for one-month LIBOR on our combined $650.0 million notional amount of interest rate swap agreements, which effectively fix the interest rate on $650.0 million of our floating rate mortgage debt. See Notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nReal Estate Investments\nThe following table reflects the revenues, property operating expenses and NOI for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 for our 2017-2018 Same Store and Non-Same Store properties (dollars in thousands):\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code and expect to continue to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income,\u201d as defined by the Code, to our stockholders. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. We believe we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT.\nCash Flows\nThere are 29 properties encompassing 10,123 units of apartment space in our same store pool for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (our 2017-2018 Same Store\u201d properties). Our 2017-2018 Same Store properties exclude the following six properties in our Portfolio as of December 31, 2018: Hollister Place, Rockledge Apartments, Atera Apartments, Cedar Pointe, Crestmont Reserve and Brandywine I & II.\nDebt, Derivatives and Hedging Activity\nRental income. Rental income was $125.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $115.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $9.6 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The increase between the periods was also due to a 7.7% increase in the weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit in our Portfolio to $948 as of December 31, 2017 from $880 as of December 31, 2016, primarily driven by the value-add program that we have implemented and organic growth in rents in the markets where our properties are located, and an increase in the occupancy rate of our Portfolio of 0.4% to 93.8% as of December 31, 2017 from 93.4% as of December 31, 2016.\n (1) Included in loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. \nAcquisition costs. No acquisition costs were expensed for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired three properties and capitalized all acquisition costs incurred. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired four properties; we expensed the acquisition costs related to one acquisition and capitalized acquisition costs of approximately $0.7 million related to three acquisitions. Acquisition costs depend on the specific circumstances of each closing and are one-time costs associated with each acquisition. We believe most future acquisition costs will be capitalized.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our 2016-2018 Same Store properties were approximately 94.7% leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $945. As of December 31, 2017, our 2016-2018 Same Store properties were approximately 94.0% leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $904. For our 2016-2018 Same Store properties, we recorded the following operating results for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 property management fees payable to BH. \nThe following table sets forth a summary of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.7 million, or 7.0%. The majority of the increase is related to a $0.7 million, or 7.4%, increase in property taxes.\n2017-2018 Same Store Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe interest rate cap agreements generally have a term of three to four years, cover the outstanding principal amount of the underlying debt and are generally required by our lenders. Under the interest rate cap agreements, we pay a fixed fee in exchange for the counterparty to pay any interest above a maximum rate. As of December 31, 2018, interest rate cap agreements covered $255.2 million of our $808.0 million of floating rate mortgage debt outstanding. These interest rate cap agreements effectively cap one-month LIBOR on $255.2 million of our floating rate mortgage debt at a weighted average rate of 5.82%.\nCash flows from operating activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $41.7 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to an increase in total revenues, decreases in total property operating expenses, prepayment penalties and defeasance costs and debt modification and other extinguishment costs paid and changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nNOI and 2017-2018 Same Store NOI for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\n2017 Bridge Facility\nThe year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nRental income. Our earnings are primarily attributable to the rental revenue from our multifamily properties. We anticipate that the leases we enter into for our multifamily properties will typically be for one year or less on average.\nThe change in our net income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to a decrease in gain on sales of real estate, and was partially offset by an increase in total revenues and decreases in total property operating expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs. The change in our net income (loss) between the periods was also due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2017 and 2018 and the timing of the transactions (we acquired one property in the first quarter of 2017, one property in the second quarter of 2017, one property in the fourth quarter of 2017 and three properties in the third quarter of 2018; we sold four properties in the second quarter of 2017, five properties in the third quarter of 2017 and one property in the first quarter of 2018).\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and our historical results of operations. The following should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected, forecasted, or expected in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report. Our management believes the assumptions underlying the Company's financial statements and accompanying notes are reasonable. However, the Company's financial statements and accompanying notes may not be an indication of our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\n\n (1) Interest expense obligations includes the impact of expected settlements on interest rate swaps which have been entered into in order to fix the interest rate on the hedged portion of our floating rate debt obligations. As of December 31, 2018, we had entered into seven interest rate swap transactions with a combined notional amount of $650.0 million. We have allocated the total impact of expected settlements on the $650.0 million notional amount of interest rate swaps to \u2018Operating Properties Mortgage Debt.' We used one-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2018 to determine our expected settlements through the terms of the interest rate swaps. \nProperty management fees. Property management fees were $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.1 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to an increase in total revenues, which the fee is primarily based on.\nGain on sales of real estate. Gain on sales of real estate includes the gain recognized upon sales of properties. Gain on sales of real estate is calculated by deducting the carrying value of the real estate and costs incurred to sell the properties from the sales prices of the properties.\n (3) For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, excludes approximately $1,013,000 and $939,000, respectively, of expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on our behalf at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees. \nCore FFO makes certain adjustments to FFO, which are either not likely to occur on a regular basis or are otherwise not representative of the ongoing operating performance of our portfolio. Core FFO adjusts FFO to remove items such as acquisition expenses, losses on extinguishment of debt and modification costs (including prepayment penalties and defeasance costs incurred on the early repayment of debt, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and fair market value adjustments of assumed debt related to the early repayment of debt, costs incurred in a debt modification that are not capitalized as deferred financing costs and other costs incurred in a debt extinguishment), casualty-related expenses and recoveries, the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with obtaining short-term debt financing, the ineffective portion of fair value adjustments on interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (see Notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements), and the noncontrolling interests (as described above) related to these items. We believe Core FFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and is useful in comparing our operating performance with other REITs that are not as involved in the aforementioned activities.\nProperty management fees. Property management fees were $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.2 million, or 4.7%. The majority of the increase is related to a $4.3 million, or 5.1%, increase in rental income, and a $0.1 million, or 1.0%, increase in other income, which the fee is primarily based on.\nRevenues\nThe year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\n\nSee reconciliation of net income (loss) to NOI below under NOI and 2017-2018 Same Store NOI for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\u201d\nRevenue Recognition\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01\u201d), which changes certain recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The ASU requires all equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or resulting in consolidation, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also simplifies the impairment assessment for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, amends the presentation requirements for changes in the fair value of financial liabilities, requires presentation of financial instruments by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We will implement the provisions of ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as we do not, nor do we expect to, have a material amount of financial assets or financial liabilities that would be subject to the provisions of ASU 2016-01.\nOn September 26, 2018, we, through the OP, repaid the $30.0 million outstanding under the $30 Million Credit Facility and amended the loan agreement, extending the maturity date to September 26, 2020 and increasing the loan commitment to $60.0 million (the $60 Million Credit Facility\u201d). We, through the OP, immediately drew $50.0 million to fund a portion of the purchase price of Brandywine I & II and Crestmont Reserve.\nRental income. Rental income was $107.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $102.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $4.7 million, or 4.5%. The majority of the increase is related to a 4.1% increase in the weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit to $963 as of December 31, 2018 from $925 as of December 31, 2017, as well as a 0.6% increase in occupancy.\nWe define Same Store NOI\u201d as NOI for our properties that are comparable between periods. We view Same Store NOI as an important measure of the operating performance of our properties because it allows us to compare operating results of properties owned for the entirety of the current and comparable periods and therefore eliminates variations caused by acquisitions or dispositions during the periods.\n (4) For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, excludes approximately $(7,000) and $18,000, respectively, of casualty-related expenses/(recoveries). \nCorporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses were $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $2.3 million. The increase between periods primarily relates to $3.1 million of equity-based compensation expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the grants of restricted stock units to our directors and officers pursuant to our 2016 LTIP, compared to $0.8 million of equity-based compensation expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements). Subject to the Expense Cap, corporate general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods as we acquire additional properties.\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and existing cash balances. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $2.0 million of renovation value-add reserves for our planned capital expenditures to implement our value-add program. Renovation value-add reserves are not required to be held in escrow by a third party. We may reallocate these funds, at our discretion, to pursue other investment opportunities or meet our short-term liquidity requirements.\n \u2022 advisory and administrative fees payable to our Adviser; \nThe allocation of total consideration, which is determined using inputs that are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy established by FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements), is based on management's estimate of the property's as-if\u201d vacant fair value and is calculated by using all available information such as the replacement cost of such asset, appraisals, property condition reports, market data and other related information. The allocation of the total consideration to intangible lease assets represents the value associated with the in-place leases, which may include lost rent, leasing commissions, legal and other related costs, which we, as buyer of the property, did not have to incur to obtain the residents. If any debt is assumed in an acquisition, the difference between the fair value, which is estimated using inputs that are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and the face value of debt is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt assumed.\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses were $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $0.4 million, or 1.3%. The majority of the decrease is related to a $0.8 million, or 10.3%, decrease in utility costs, partially offset by a $0.3 million, or 2.4%, increase in labor costs.\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses were $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.7 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The increase between the periods was also due to a $1.0 million, or 8.8%, increase in repairs and maintenance costs, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in casualty recoveries.\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses were $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $0.1 million, or 0.1%.\nRevenues\nFFO was $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $31.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was a decrease of approximately $5.9 million. The change in our FFO between the periods primarily relates to increases in total property operating expenses of $4.0 million, interest expense of $9.4 million, loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs of $4.0 million and corporate general and administrative expenses of $2.3 million, partially offset by an increase in total revenues of $11.4 million and adjustments for amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) ( ASU 2017-12\u201d), which clarifies hedge accounting requirements, improves disclosure of hedging arrangements, and better aligns risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. We early adopted ASU 2017-12 on January 1, 2018, on a modified retrospective basis. For cash flow hedges existing as of the date of adoption, we eliminated the separate measurement of ineffectiveness by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated OCI with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated earnings less dividends on January 1, 2018. The cumulative-effect adjustment, which eliminated the cumulative ineffectiveness that was previously reported in interest expense, resulted in an increase to OCI of approximately $1.4 million, with a corresponding decrease to accumulated earnings less dividends.\nThe change in our net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to increases in total revenues and gain on sales of real estate, and was partially offset by increases in total property operating expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs. The change in our net income between the periods was also due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions (we acquired one property in the third quarter of 2016, three properties in the fourth quarter of 2016, one property in the first quarter of 2017, one property in the second quarter of 2017 and one property in the fourth quarter of 2017; we sold three properties in the second quarter of 2016, four properties in the third quarter of 2016, four properties in the second quarter of 2017 and five properties in the third quarter of 2017).\nWe believe that the use of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. While FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income (loss) as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO, Core FFO and AFFO do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO, Core FFO and AFFO reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define Core FFO or AFFO differently than we do.\nObligations and Commitments\nOverview\nProperty management fees. Property management fees were $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.1 million, or 4.3%. The majority of the increase is related to a $4.7 million, or 4.5%, increase in rental income, and a $0.5 million, or 2.8%, increase in other income, which the fee is primarily based on.\nGain on sales of real estate. Gain on sales of real estate was $78.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $52.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold nine properties; during the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold seven properties.\n (3) There were no existing deferred financing costs related to the prior fixed rate mortgage. We wrote-off the unamortized fair market value adjustment as of June 1, 2018, a premium of less than $0.1 million, related to the prior fixed rate mortgage, which is recorded in loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. \nIn order to obtain more favorable pricing on our mortgage debt financing with Freddie Mac, we have decided to participate in Freddie Mac's new Multifamily Green Advantage program (the Green Program\u201d). In the second quarter of 2017, we escrowed approximately $4.2 million to finance smarter, greener property improvements at 18 of our properties. In connection with the three acquisitions and seven refinancings we completed in 2018, we escrowed approximately $1.2 million related to the Green Program. Since the inception of the Green Program through December 31, 2018, we had spent approximately $2.5 million on green improvements and completed 17 Green Programs. We expect to spend approximately $1.1 million on green improvements in 2019. We expect to reduce water/sewer costs at each property where the Green Program is implemented by at least 15% through the replacement of showerheads, plumbing fixtures and toilets with modern energy efficient upgrades. In 2018, for the 17 properties where the Green Program was completed, this resulted in an estimated reduction of utility costs of approximately $1.4 million.\n (4) Previous mortgage was an assumed fixed-rate loan. \nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs were $48.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $13.2 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to the amortization of intangible lease assets of $8.9 million related to seven properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.4 million related to five properties for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $7.5 million, as well as the acquisition of three properties subsequent to December 31, 2016. The amortization of intangible lease assets over a six-month period from the date of acquisition is expected to increase the amortization expense during the initial year of operations for each property. The increase between the periods was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense related to the disposition of nine properties subsequent to December 31, 2016.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, and expect to continue to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85% of our ordinary income, (2) 95% of our capital gain net income and (3) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. We believe we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs were $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $48.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $1.3 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to the amortization of intangible lease assets of $2.5 million related to four properties for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $8.9 million related to seven properties for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $6.4 million. The decrease between the periods was partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in depreciation expense, primarily due to our acquisition activity in 2017 and 2018 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The amortization of intangible lease assets over a six-month period from the date of acquisition is expected to increase the amortization expense during the initial year of operations for each property.\nInflation may also affect the overall cost of debt, as the implied cost of capital increases. Currently, interest rates are less than historical averages. However, the Federal Reserve, in response to or in anticipation of continued inflation concerns, could continue to raise interest rates. We intend to mitigate these risks through long-term fixed interest rate loans and interest rate hedges, which to date have included interest rate cap and interest rate swap agreements.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization costs primarily include depreciation of our multifamily properties and amortization of acquired in-place leases.\nRevenues\nExpenses\n (2) For previous floating rate mortgages, represents the reduction in the borrowing spread from the previous mortgage to the current mortgage. For previous fixed-rate mortgages, represents the reduction in the borrowing rate from the previous mortgage to the current mortgage (using one-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2018). \nThe following table sets forth a summary of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nCorporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses include, but are not limited to, audit fees, legal fees, listing fees, board of director fees, equity-based compensation expense, investor relations costs and payments of reimbursements to our Adviser for operating expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses and the advisory and administrative fees paid to our Adviser (including advisory and administrative fees on properties defined in the Advisory Agreement as New Assets) will not exceed 1.5% of Average Real Estate Assets per calendar year (or part thereof that the Advisory Agreement is in effect), calculated in accordance with the Advisory Agreement, or the Expense Cap. The Expense Cap does not limit the reimbursement by us of expenses related to securities offerings paid by our Adviser. The Expense Cap also does not apply to legal, accounting, financial, due diligence, and other service fees incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions, extraordinary litigation, or other events outside our ordinary course of business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of real estate assets.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We may elect to comply with public company effective dates at any time, and such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. The following recent accounting pronouncements reflect effective dates that delay the adoption until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nUpon acquisition of a property, the purchase price and related acquisition costs ( total consideration\u201d) are allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and intangible lease assets in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations, and ASU 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business (Topic 805) ( ASU 2017-01\u201d), which we early adopted on October 1, 2016. We believe most future acquisition costs will be capitalized in accordance with ASU 2017-01. Prior to our adoption of ASU 2017-01, acquisition costs were expensed as incurred.\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses include property maintenance costs, salary and employee benefit costs, utilities, casualty-related expenses and recoveries and other property operating costs.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses were $35.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $3.1 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2017 and 2018 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The decrease between the periods was also due to a $1.5 million, or 13.5%, decrease in utility costs and a $0.8 million, or 4.8%, decrease in labor costs.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCapital Expenditures and Value-Add Program\n (1) Prior to our adoption of ASU 2017-12 on January 1, 2018, the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was recognized directly in net income (loss) as interest expense. The adoption of ASU 2017-12 eliminates the separate measurement of effectiveness and ineffectiveness, and all changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded directly in OCI. See Notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. \nAs of December 31, 2017, our 2016-2018 Same Store properties were approximately 94.0% leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $904. As of December 31, 2016, our 2016-2018 Same Store properties were approximately 93.7% leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $865. For our 2016-2018 Same Store properties, we recorded the following operating results for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016:\nRental income. Rental income was $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $79.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $5.0 million, or 6.2%. The majority of the increase is related to a 4.5% increase in the weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit to $904 as of December 31, 2017 from $865 as of December 31, 2016, as well as a 0.3% increase in occupancy.\nFreddie Mac Multifamily Green Advantage\nOther Income and Expense\nThe following table reconciles our calculations of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nAFFO makes certain adjustments to Core FFO in order to arrive at a more refined measure of the operating performance of our portfolio. There is no industry standard definition of AFFO and practice is divergent across the industry. AFFO adjusts Core FFO to remove items such as equity-based compensation expense and the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with obtaining long-term debt financing, and the noncontrolling interests (as described above) related to these items. We believe AFFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and is useful in comparing our operating performance with other REITs that are not as involved in the aforementioned activities.\nCash flows from investing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by investing activities was $2.3 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $51.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flows from investing activities was mainly due to the acquisition of three properties for a combined purchase price of approximately $197.2 million during the period in 2017, compared to the acquisition of four properties for a combined purchase price of approximately $175.1 million during the period in 2016. The change in cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from sales of real estate; we sold nine properties for net proceeds of approximately $224.4 million during the period in 2017, compared to selling seven properties for net proceeds of approximately $131.8 million during the period in 2016.\nWe recognize our tax positions and evaluate them using a two-step process. First, we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Second, we will determine the amount of benefit to recognize and record the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nOther Income and Expense\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, our 2017-2018 Same Store properties were approximately 94.5% leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $963. As of December 31, 2017, our 2017-2018 Same Store properties were approximately 93.9% leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $925. For our 2017-2018 Same Store properties, we recorded the following operating results for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017:\nThe cost of funds is eliminated from net income (loss) because it is specific to our particular financing capabilities and constraints. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital, which may have changed or may change in the future. Acquisition costs and non-operating fees to affiliates are eliminated because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our multifamily properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale, which will usually change from period to period. Casualty-related expenses and recoveries are excluded because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. Entity level general and administrative expenses incurred at the properties are eliminated as they are specific to the way in which we have chosen to hold our properties and are the result of our ownership structuring. Also, expenses that are incurred upon acquisition of a property do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these items from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual ongoing revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nFurthermore, following the completion of our value-add and capital expenditures programs and depending on the interest rate environment at the applicable time, we may seek to refinance our floating rate debt into longer-term fixed rate debt at lower leverage levels.\nIn order to fix a portion of, and mitigate the risk associated with, our floating rate indebtedness (without incurring substantial prepayment penalties or defeasance costs typically associated with fixed rate indebtedness when repaid early or refinanced), we, through the OP, have entered into seven interest rate swap transactions with KeyBank (the Counterparty\u201d) with a combined notional amount of $650.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, the interest rate swaps we have entered into effectively replace the floating interest rate (one-month LIBOR) with respect to $650.0 million of our floating rate mortgage debt outstanding with a weighted average fixed rate of 1.3388%. During the term of these interest rate swap agreements, we are required to make monthly fixed rate payments of 1.3388%, on a weighted average basis, on the notional amounts, while the Counterparty is obligated to make monthly floating rate payments based on one-month LIBOR to us referencing the same notional amounts. For purposes of hedge accounting under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 815, Derivatives and Hedging, we have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. See Notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We may elect to comply with public company effective dates at any time, and such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.\n (5) For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, excludes approximately $441,000, $370,000 and $283,000, respectively, of expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on our behalf at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees. \nReal estate assets, including land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and intangible lease assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized at cost.\nOn December 29, 2016, we, through the OP, entered into a $30.0 million credit facility (the $30 Million Credit Facility\u201d) with KeyBank. On April 27, 2018, we, through the OP, amended the $30 Million Credit Facility to temporarily increase the loan commitment by $5.0 million (the Temporary Increase\u201d) and immediately drew $5.0 million. The $5.0 million drawn under the Temporary Increase was repaid in full on July 25, 2018.\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses include the costs of marketing, professional fees, general office supplies, and other administrative related costs of each property.\nOur primary operations consist of rental income earned from our residents under lease agreements typically with terms of one year or less. Rental income is recognized when earned. This policy effectively results in income recognition on the straight-line method over the related terms of the leases. Resident reimbursements and other income consist of charges billed to residents for utilities, carport and garage rental, and pets, administrative, application and other fees and are recognized when earned.\nCash flows from investing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $137.0 million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in cash flows from investing activities was mainly due to a decrease in net proceeds from sales of real estate. We sold one property for net proceeds of approximately $29.6 million during the period in 2018; we sold nine properties for net proceeds of approximately $224.4 million during the period in 2017. The change in cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by the acquisition of three properties for a combined purchase price of approximately $131.0 million during the period in 2018 compared to the acquisition of three properties for a combined purchase price of approximately $197.2 million during the period in 2017.\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes include the property taxes assessed by local and state authorities depending on the location of each property. Insurance includes the cost of commercial, general liability, and other needed insurance for each property.\nOn November 14, 2018, in connection with the 2018 Offering, we issued 2,702,500 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a public offering price of $33.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $84.8 million (after underwriters' discounts and offering costs). We contributed the net proceeds from the 2018 Offering to the OP in exchange for 2,702,500 OP Units, and the OP in turn used a majority of the net proceeds to repay the $50.0 million outstanding under the $60 Million Credit Facility and the $30.0 million outstanding under the $30 Million Bridge Facility (see Notes 6 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements).\nNon-GAAP Measurements\n2016-2018 Same Store Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nHowever, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes corporate general and administrative expenses, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs, acquisition costs, certain fees to affiliates such as advisory and administrative fees, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as determined under GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income, which further limits its usefulness.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for debt maturities, operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our multifamily properties, including:\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $1.0 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to an increase in gain recognized related to the effective portion of changes in fair value of our interest rate swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of approximately $5.3 million (see Debt, Derivatives and Hedging Activity - Interest Rate Swap Agreements\u201d below). The decrease between the periods was partially offset by an increase in interest on debt of approximately $4.6 million. The following table details the various costs included in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nInterest expense. Interest expense was $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $9.4 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to an increase in interest on debt and a reduction in gain recognized related to the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of our interest rate swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (see Debt, Derivatives and Hedging Activity - Interest Rate Swap Agreements\u201d below), as shown in the table below. The following table details the various costs included in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nCash flows from financing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $95.1 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in cash flows from financing activities was mainly due to receiving net proceeds of approximately $84.8 million in the 2018 Offering and a net increase in debt of approximately $14.1 million between the periods, partially offset by increases in common stock repurchases of approximately $7.2 million and common stock dividends paid of approximately $3.0 million between the periods and the $51.7 million purchase amount of the purchase of 100% of the joint venture interests in our Portfolio owned by BH Equities, LLC\n (2) Fees incurred to an unaffiliated third party that is an affiliate of the noncontrolling limited partner of the OP. \nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses were $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.3 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The increase between the periods was also due to a $0.3 million, or 24.4%, increase in advertising and promotional costs.\nThe year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\n\nOther income. Other income was $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $1.4 million, or 11.1%. The majority of the increase is related to a $0.8 million, or 11.8%, increase in utility reimbursements and a $0.4 million, or 77.1%, increase in other resident charges.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs. Loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs includes prepayment penalties and defeasance costs, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and fair market value adjustments of assumed debt related to the early repayment of debt, costs incurred in a debt modification that are not capitalized as deferred financing costs and other costs incurred in a debt extinguishment.\nNOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in -Results of Operations\u201d regarding the components of net income (loss) that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.\nExpenses\n \u2022 reimbursements to our Adviser; and \n\n \u2022 interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness (see -Obligations and Commitments\u201d below); \n (1) Prior to our adoption of ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) ( ASU 2017-12\u201d) on January 1, 2018, the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was recognized directly in net income (loss) as interest expense. The adoption of ASU 2017-12 eliminates the separate measurement of effectiveness and ineffectiveness, and all changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded directly in other comprehensive income ( OCI\u201d). See Notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n (1) Includes total capital expenditures during the period on completed and in-progress interior rehabs. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we completed full and partial interior rehabs on 1,432, 1,588 and 1,812 units, respectively. \n (3) For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, excludes approximately $853,000, $760,000 and $596,000, respectively, of expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on our behalf at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees. \n\nAFFO was $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $1.2 million. The change in our AFFO between the periods primarily relates to an increase in equity-based compensation expense of $2.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in Core FFO.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs. Loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs was $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $4.0 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to increases in prepayment penalties and defeasance costs of approximately $1.9 million and debt modification and other extinguishment costs of approximately $1.8 million. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we sold nine properties and seven properties, respectively. The following table details the various costs included in loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses were $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $0.3 million, or 1.0%. The majority of the decrease is related to a $0.8 million, or 8.8%, decrease in utility costs, partially offset by a $0.3 million, or 2.5%, increase in labor costs.\n (1) For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, excludes approximately $(664,000), $(318,000) and $56,000, respectively, of casualty-related expenses/(recoveries). \n (1) For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, excludes approximately $656,000 and $305,000, respectively, of casualty-related recoveries. \nLoss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs. Loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs was $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $2.1 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to decreases in debt modification and other extinguishment costs of approximately $1.5 million and prepayment penalties and defeasance costs of approximately $1.0 million. The following table details the various costs included in loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nGain on sales of real estate. Gain on sales of real estate was $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $78.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $64.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold one property; during the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold nine properties.\n (4) For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, excludes approximately $1,000, $31,000 and $95,000, respectively, of casualty-related expenses. \nWe anticipate incurring average annual repairs and maintenance expense of $575 to $725 per apartment unit in connection with the ongoing operations of our business. These expenditures are expensed as incurred. In addition, we reserve, on average, approximately $250 to $350 per apartment unit for non-recurring capital expenditures and/or lender required replacement reserves. When incurred, these expenditures are either capitalized or expensed, in accordance with GAAP, depending on the type of the expenditure. Although we will continuously monitor the adequacy of this average, we believe these figures to be sufficient to maintain the properties at a high level in the markets in which we operate. A majority of the properties in our Portfolio were underwritten and acquired with the premise that we would invest $4,000 to $10,000 per unit in the first 36 months of ownership, in an effort to add value to the asset's exterior and interiors. In most cases, we reserved cash at closing to fund these planned capital expenditures and value-add improvements. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $2.0 million of renovation value-add reserves for our planned capital expenditures and other expenses to implement our value-add program, which will complete approximately 325 planned interior rehabs. The following table sets forth a summary of our capital expenditures related to our value-add program for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\n (1) The floating rate option for the interest rate swaps is one-month LIBOR. As of December 31, 2018, one-month LIBOR was 2.5027%. \nAdvisory and administrative fees. Advisory and administrative fees include the fees paid to our Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement (see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements).\nProperty management fees. Property management fees were $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.3 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to increases in rental income and other income, which the fee is primarily based on.\nFFO, Core FFO and AFFO\nThe real estate market has not been affected significantly by inflation in the past several years due to a relatively low inflation rate. The majority of our lease terms are for a period of one year or less and reset to market if renewed. The majority of our leases also contain protection provisions applicable to reimbursement billings for utilities. Should inflation return, due to the short-term nature of our leases, we do not believe our results will be materially affected.\nAcquisition costs. Acquisition costs include the costs to acquire additional properties. On October 1, 2016, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-01, which requires an entity to capitalize acquisition costs associated with an acquisition that is determined to be an acquisition of an asset as opposed to an acquisition of a business. Prior to our adoption of ASU 2017-01, acquisition costs were expensed as incurred. We believe most future acquisition costs will be capitalized in accordance with ASU 2017-01.\nThe year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017\nOn January 28, 2019, we, through the OP, entered into a $75.0 million credit facility (the $75 Million Credit Facility\u201d) with SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto, and immediately drew $52.5 million to fund a portion of the purchase price of three properties we acquired on January 28, 2019. The $75 Million Credit Facility is a full-term, interest-only facility with an initial 24-month term, has one 12-month extension option, bears interest at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus a range from 2.00% to 2.50%, depending on our leverage level as determined under the credit facility agreement, and is guaranteed by us. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses were $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.1 million, or 2.7%.\nIn addition to our value-add program, our multifamily properties will require periodic capital expenditures and renovation to remain competitive. Also, acquisitions, redevelopments, or expansions of our multifamily properties will require significant capital outlays. Long-term, we may not be able to fund such capital improvements solely from net cash provided by operations because we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deductions for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT, and we are subject to tax on any retained income and gains. As a result, our ability to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, or redevelopment through retained earnings long-term is limited. Consequently, we expect to rely heavily upon the availability of debt or equity capital for these purposes. If we are unable to obtain the necessary capital on favorable terms, or at all, our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRental income. Rental income was $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $4.3 million, or 5.1%. The majority of the increase is related to a 4.5% increase in the weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit to $945 as of December 31, 2018 from $904 as of December 31, 2017, as well as a 0.7% increase in occupancy.\n \u2022 distributions necessary to qualify for taxation as a REIT; \nSince the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges. We compute FFO attributable to common stockholders in accordance with NAREIT's definition. Our presentation differs slightly in that we begin with net income (loss) before adjusting for amounts attributable to (1) noncontrolling interests in consolidated joint ventures and (2) redeemable noncontrolling interests in the OP and we show the combined amounts attributable to such noncontrolling interests as an adjustment to arrive at FFO attributable to common stockholders.\nInflation\nExpenses\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\n \u2022 general and administrative expenses; \nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity should also disclose sufficient quantitative and qualitative information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date, which amends ASU 2014-09 to defer the effective date by one year. The new standard is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities are allowed to use either the full or modified retrospective approach when transitioning to the ASU. We will implement the provisions of ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a substantial portion of our revenue consists of rental income from leasing arrangements, which is specifically excluded from ASU 2014-09.\n\nIn August 2018, the SEC adopted SEC Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification (the SEC Release\u201d), which amends certain disclosure requirements that were redundant, duplicative, overlapping or superseded by other SEC disclosure requirements or GAAP. The amendments generally eliminated or otherwise reduced certain disclosure requirements of various SEC rules and regulations. However, in some cases, the amendments require additional information to be disclosed, including changes in stockholders' equity in interim periods. Under the SEC Release, registrants will be required to disclose in interim periods on Form 10-Q the changes in each caption of stockholders' equity and noncontrolling interests for the current and comparative year-to-date periods, with subtotals for each interim period and the amount of dividends per share for each class of shares. The amendments require registrants, including smaller reporting companies, to provide information as prescribed by Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X. Therefore, the interim disclosures of changes in stockholders' equity, including dividends per share amounts, may be given in a note to the financial statements or in a separate financial statement. Under Rule 3-04, the interim disclosures of the changes in stockholders' equity should be in the form of a reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance for each period for which an income statement is required to be filed, with all significant reconciling items described by appropriate captions. The reconciliation should also reflect any adjustments to the balance at the beginning of the earliest period presented for items retroactively applied to periods prior to that period. We adopted the provisions of the SEC Release on September 30, 2018, on a retrospective basis.\nThe following table, which has not been adjusted for the effects of noncontrolling interests, reconciles our NOI and our 2016-2018 Same Store NOI for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (in thousands):\n (2) Adjustment to net income (loss) to exclude certain property general and administrative expenses that are not reflective of the continuing operations of the properties or are incurred on our behalf at the property for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees. \nProperty operating expenses. Property operating expenses were $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $1.1 million, or 4.3%. The majority of the increase is related to a $0.9 million, or 11.6%, increase in repairs and maintenance costs.\nAFFO was $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $6.0 million. The change in our AFFO between the periods primarily relates to increases in Core FFO and equity-based compensation expense of $1.1 million.\nWe will make dividend payments based on our estimate of taxable earnings per share of common stock, but not earnings calculated pursuant to GAAP. Our dividends and taxable income and GAAP earnings will typically differ due to items such as depreciation and amortization, fair value adjustments, differences in premium amortization and discount accretion, and non-deductible general and administrative expenses. Our quarterly dividends per share may be substantially different than our quarterly taxable earnings and GAAP earnings per share. Our Board declared our fourth quarterly dividend of 2018 of $0.275 per share on October 29, 2018, which was paid on December 31, 2018 and funded out of cash flows from operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our Portfolio consisted of 35 multifamily properties primarily located in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States encompassing 12,555 units of apartment space that was approximately 94.6% leased with a weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $985. Substantially all of our business is conducted through the OP. We own the Portfolio through the OP and our TRS. The OP owns approximately 99.9% of the Portfolio; our TRS owns approximately 0.1% of the Portfolio. The OP GP is the sole general partner of the OP. As of December 31, 2018, there were 23,819,402 OP Units outstanding, of which 23,746,169, or 99.7%, were owned by us and 73,233, or 0.3%, were owned by an unaffiliated limited partner (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements).\nDividends\nOn June 30, 2017, we, through the OP, entered into a $65.9 million bridge facility (the 2017 Bridge Facility\u201d) with KeyBank. The 2017 Bridge Facility was a full-term, interest-only facility with an initial four-month term. The 2017 Bridge Facility was guaranteed by us. Interest accrued on the 2017 Bridge Facility at an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 3.75%. In July 2017, we used proceeds from the sale of Regatta Bay to pay down $11.3 million on the 2017 Bridge Facility. In October 2017, we used proceeds from the sale of four properties to pay down $46.0 million on the 2017 Bridge Facility, bringing the outstanding principal balance to $8.6 million, and also extended the maturity date to March 31, 2018. In February 2018, we used proceeds from the sale of Timberglen to pay the remaining $8.6 million outstanding on the 2017 Bridge Facility, which retired the bridge facility. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nExpenses\nCorporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses were $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $1.5 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to approximately $4.2 million of equity-based compensation expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the grants of restricted stock units to our directors, officers, employees and certain key employees of our Adviser pursuant to our long-term incentive plan (the 2016 LTIP\u201d), compared to $3.1 million of equity-based compensation expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements). Subject to the Expense Cap, corporate general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods as we acquire additional properties.\nNet Operating Income for Our 2016-2018 Same Store and Non-Same Store Properties for the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.6 million, or 3.7%. The majority of the increase is related to a $0.4 million, or 3.2%, increase in property taxes.\nWe had no material unrecognized tax benefit or expense, accrued interest or penalties as of December 31, 2018. We and our subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax as well as income tax of various state and local jurisdictions. The 2017, 2016 and 2015 tax years remain open to examination by tax jurisdictions to which our subsidiaries and we are subject. When applicable, we recognize interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income. Other income was $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $0.6 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2017 and 2018 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The decrease between the periods was also due to a $0.7 million, or 6.0%, decrease in utility reimbursements.\nThe following table contains summary information regarding our outstanding interest rate swaps (dollars in thousands):\nOther income. Other income includes ancillary income earned from tenants such as application fees, late fees, laundry fees, utility reimbursements, and other rental related fees charged to tenants.\nAdvisory and administrative fees. Advisory and administrative fees were $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $0.6 million. The amount incurred during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 represents the maximum fee allowed on properties defined as Contributed Assets under the Advisory Agreement plus approximately $2.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, of advisory and administrative fees incurred on certain properties defined as New Assets. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Adviser elected to voluntarily waive the advisory and administrative fees incurred on the five properties we acquired subsequent to October 2016, which totaled approximately $2.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our Adviser elected to voluntarily waive the advisory and administrative fees incurred on the two properties we acquired subsequent to October 2016, which totaled less than $0.1 million. The advisory and administrative fees waived by our Adviser for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are considered to be permanently waived for the periods. Our Adviser is not contractually obligated to waive fees on New Assets in the future and may cease waiving fees on New Assets at its discretion. Advisory and administrative fees may increase in future periods as we acquire additional properties, which will be classified as New Assets.\n (1) Adjustment to net income (loss) to exclude certain property operating expenses that are casualty-related recoveries. \nWe began operations on March 31, 2015 as a result of the transfer and contribution by NHF of all but one of the multifamily properties owned by NHF through its wholly owned subsidiary NREO in exchange for 100% of its outstanding common stock. We use the term predecessor\u201d to mean the carve-out business of NREO, which owned all or a majority interest in the multifamily properties transferred or contributed to us by NHF through NREO. On March 31, 2015, NHF distributed all of the outstanding shares of our common stock held by NHF to holders of NHF common shares. We refer to the distribution of our common stock by NHF as the Spin-Off.\u201d Substantially all of our operations were conducted by our predecessor prior to March 31, 2015. With the exception of a nominal amount of initial cash funded at inception, we did not own any assets prior to March 31, 2015. Our predecessor included all of the properties in our Portfolio that were held indirectly by NREO prior to the Spin-Off. Our predecessor was determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. References throughout this report to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d or our,\u201d include the activity of the predecessor defined above.\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $1.5 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to a $1.5 million, or 9.4%, increase in property taxes. Property taxes incurred in the first year of ownership may be significantly less than subsequent years since the purchase price of the property may trigger a significant increase in assessed value by the taxing authority in subsequent years, increasing the cost of real estate taxes.\nProperty general and administrative expenses. Property general and administrative expenses were $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was a decrease of approximately $0.1 million. The decrease between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2017 and 2018 and the timing of the transactions, as described above.\nThere are 25 properties encompassing 8,567 units of apartment space in our same store pool for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (our 2016-2018 Same Store\u201d properties). Our 2016-2018 Same Store properties exclude the following 10 properties in our Portfolio as of December 31, 2018: Parc500, The Colonnade, Old Farm, Stone Creek at Old Farm, Hollister Place, Rockledge Apartments, Atera Apartments, Cedar Pointe, Crestmont Reserve and Brandywine I & II.\n (1) Adjustment to net income (loss) to exclude certain property operating expenses that are casualty-related expenses/(recoveries). \nRevenues\n\nCore FFO was $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was a decrease of approximately $1.4 million. The change in our Core FFO between the periods primarily relates to a decrease in FFO and a decrease in gain recognized related to the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of our interest rate swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of $1.4 million, partially offset by an increase in loss on extinguishment of debt and modification costs of $4.0 million and adjustments for amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nOther income. Other income was $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.1 million, or 1.0%. The majority of the increase is related to a $0.3 million, or 8.1%, increase in administrative and application fees, partially offset by a $0.1 million, or 2.0%, decrease in utility reimbursements.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nExpenses\nReal estate taxes and insurance. Real estate taxes and insurance costs were $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was an increase of approximately $3.1 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to our acquisition and disposition activity in 2016 and 2017 and the timing of the transactions, as described above. The increase between the periods was also due to a $2.8 million, or 20.3%, increase in property taxes and a $0.3 million, or 13.6%, increase in property liability insurance. Property taxes incurred in the first year of ownership may be significantly less than subsequent years since the purchase price of the property may trigger a significant increase in assessed value by the taxing authority in subsequent years, increasing the cost of real estate taxes.\nOther income. Other income was $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of approximately $0.5 million, or 2.8%. The majority of the increase is related to a $0.4 million, or 9.6%, increase in administrative and application fees.\n$60 Million Credit Facility", "item_7_tables": "Table 238: <table> <tr>

Revenues were $146.6 million in 2018, up from $144.2 million in 2017 and $132.8 million in 2016.\n\n- Net income (loss) was $(1.6) million in 2018, down from $56.4 million in 2017 and $25.9 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower gains on sales of real estate. \n\n- NOI (net operating income) was $80.2 million in 2018, up from $76.6 million in 2017 and $69.7 million in 2016. \n\n- FFO (funds from operations) was $32.0 million in 2018, up from $25.1 million in 2017 but down from $31.0 million in 2016. \n\n- The company has mortgage debt outstanding of $845.7 million as of December 31, 2018 and has entered into interest rate swaps to fix rates on a portion of its floating rate debt.\n\n- The company paid dividends of $1.025 per share in 2018 and dividend coverage ratios were 1.44x FFO, 1.58x Core FFO, and 1.84x AFFO (adjusted funds from operations).\n\n- The company invested $17.7 million in capital expenditures and its value-add program in 2018 to renovate and upgrade properties.\n\n- The company's liquidity and capital resources come from property operations, debt financing, and equity issuances. It has credit facilities in place for additional liquidity.\n\nIn summary, the company continued to grow revenues and NOI through property acquisitions and its value-add program, but net income decreased in 2018 due to lower gains on property sales. The company is financing its growth through leverage and equity issuances and remains focused on enhancing the performance of its multifamily property portfolio."}
