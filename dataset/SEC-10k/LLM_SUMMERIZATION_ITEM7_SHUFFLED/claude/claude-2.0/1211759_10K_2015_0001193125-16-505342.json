Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe statements included herein that are not based solely on historical facts are \u201cforward looking statements.\u201d Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by us in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly under the section titled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a leading web-based consumer shopping, enrollment and retention platform for health insurance distribution. Our solutions support the industry evolution towards a consumer-centric experience that is transforming how health insurance is purchased and distributed. Our solutions offer personalized health insurance shopping experience that recommends the best fit insurance plan based on an individual's preferences, health status, preferred providers, medications and expected out-of-pocket costs. Our customers are health insurance marketplace operators, such as health plans, brokers, and exchange operators that must distribute health insurance in a cost-effective manner to a growing number of insured consumers. Our solutions automate key functions in the health insurance distribution process, allowing our customers to price and present plan options accurately to consumers and efficiently enroll, renew and manage plan members.\nWe serve four separate but related market segments: Enterprise/Commercial, Enterprise/State, Medicare and Private Exchange. Our largest market segment is the Enterprise/Commercial market, in which we sell our solutions to health plans. Our Enterprise/State segment sells our sales automation solutions to state governments, which allow our state government customers to offer customized individual and small group exchanges. Our Medicare segment sells web-based Medicare plan comparison and enrollment tools to a variety of different customers, including health plans, pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, pharmacies, field marketing organizations, or FMOs, and call centers. Lastly, our Private Exchange segment sells comprehensive defined-contribution benefit exchange solutions to benefit consultants, brokers, exchange operators and aggregators. We believe our presence in these markets and resulting access to such a broad and diverse customer base gives us a strong position at the center of the health insurance distribution marketplace.\nWe sell our web-based solutions and related services primarily through our direct sales force. We derive most of our revenue from software services fees, which primarily consist of monthly subscription fees paid to us for access to, usage and hosting of our web-based insurance distribution software solutions, and related production support services. Software services fees paid to us from our Enterprise/Commercial customers are based on the size of the health plan for a specified period of time, which usually ranges from three to five years, and the number of software modules used. Software services fees paid to our Enterprise/State segment are based on the number of software solutions modules contracted to be used, for a specified period of time, which usually ranges from one to three years. Software services fees paid to us from our Medicare and Private Exchange customers are based on the volume of enrollments for which our software solutions are utilized for a contracted period, which usually ranges from one to three years.\nOur Enterprise/State software service and professional services fees are largely derived from multiple element contracts for non-hosted software solutions and related services for which we do not have vendor\nspecific objective evidence, or VSOE, of relative fair value of the contractual elements. In addition, we derive ongoing production support revenues from separately contracted arrangements for which we do have VSOE. For purposes of presentation in management's discussion and analysis, management classifies a portion of the overall arrangement fee as software services and professional services based on an evaluation of various available indicators of fair value, including relative contract value of the software and professional services elements to total contractual value, and applies judgment to reasonably classify the arrangement fee. Our classification of multiple element arrangement fees is for management's discussion and analysis purposes only and does not affect the timing or amount of revenue recognized.\nThe amount of Enterprise/State revenue classified as perpetual software licenses within our software services revenue is less than 10% of consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nSoftware services revenue accounted for approximately 67%, 75% and 68% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nOur customer contracts are generally only cancellable by the customer in an instance of our uncured breach, although some of our customers (including government customers) are able to terminate their respective contracts without cause or for convenience. Of our top 20 customers by 2015 revenue, some customers can terminate their contract for convenience upon written notice of between 30 and 60 days. These customers represented $20.2 million, or 22.5% of our Contracted Backlog balance as of December 31, 2015.\nAnother component of our revenue is professional services, which we primarily derive from the implementation of our customers onto our platform, typically including discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing and training. In general, it takes from six to fifteen months to implement a new Enterprise/Commercial or Enterprise/State customer's insurance distribution solution and from one to four months to implement a new Medicare or Private Exchange insurance distribution solution.\nProfessional services revenue accounted for approximately 30%, 21% and 24% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe also derive a small portion of our revenue from commissions earned on annual employee enrollments in which our health plan network and software solutions are used in connection with each enrollment.\nManagement is focused on risks that could have an adverse impact on our operations and our key financial and operating performance metrics, as described below, and takes actions to mitigate those risks. In our Enterprise/Commercial segment, for example, while fluctuations in bookings are not uncommon given the sales cycle for product and services in that segment, management routinely assesses staffing levels required to support contracted business volume and adjusts staffing levels accordingly. As part of its ongoing assessment of our software capabilities, management also considers industry trends, such as consumers' increased reliance on mobile devices, to determine where to allocate research and development funding. One of our overall strategic initiatives is to continue to increase the percentage of software services revenue (and reduce professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue) as we believe this will have a positive impact on overall gross margins in the future.\nKey Financial and Operating Performance Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and project our future performance. These metrics help us develop and refine our growth strategies and make strategic decisions. We discuss consolidated revenue, gross margin and the components of operating loss, as well as segment revenue and components of segment gross margin, in \u201cManagement's Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Components of Operating Results.\u201d In addition, we utilize other key metrics as described below.\nContracted Backlog\nWe believe the balance of contracted future billings, or Contracted Backlog, is an important indicator of the economic health of our business, as it provides an important source of visibility into our future sources of revenue.\nWe have generally signed multiple-year subscription contracts for our software services. The timing of our invoices to our customer is a negotiated term and thus varies among our software contracts. For multiple-year agreements, it is common to invoice an initial amount at contract signing for implementation work that is deferred, followed by subsequent annual, quarterly or monthly invoices once we launch a customer, which is when our product is usable by the customer. At any point in the contract term, there may be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements and are considered by us to be Contracted Backlog. The amount of our total Contracted Backlog for software services and professional services contracts, which we define as including both cancellable and non-cancellable portions of our customer agreements that we have not yet billed, was approximately $89.7 million and $78.2 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We fulfill Contracted Backlog associated with a customer contract when the customer implementation process is complete. Our implementation timelines can vary between one and 15 months based on the type of solution, source and condition of the data we receive from third parties, the configurations that we agree to provide and the size of the customer. As a result, our implementation timelines are subject to significant uncertainties, which can have a material impact on our total Contracted Backlog and Contracted Backlog that we fulfill in the current year. Based on our current implementation forecasts, we expect to fulfill our total Contracted Backlog as of December 31, 2015 over a period of approximately four years.\nThe anticipated impact of the December 31, 2015 Contracted Backlog on each future year is as follows:\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Millions of Dollars </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TOTAL\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> We expect that the amount of our Contracted Backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from period to period for several reasons, including the amount of cash collected early in the contract term, the specific timing and duration of large customer contracts, varying invoicing cycles of customer contracts, potential customer upsells dependent on our customer contracts, the specific timing of customer renewal and changes in customer financial circumstances. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in our Contracted Backlog may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue beyond one year.\nSoftware Revenue Retention Rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand the revenue we generate from them over time is an important component of our growth strategy and reflects the long-term value of our customer relationships. We measure our performance on this basis using a metric we refer to as our Software Revenue Retention Rate. We calculate this metric for a particular period by establishing the group of our customers that had active contracts for a given period (excluding our Enterprise/State customers, of which there were two and three customers in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively). We then calculate our Software\nRevenue Retention Rate by taking the amount of software revenue we recognized for this group in the subsequent comparable period (for which we are reporting the rate) and dividing it by the software revenue we recognized for the group in the prior period.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our Software Revenue Retention Rate was in excess of 92%.\nAdjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted gross margin represents our gross margin before depreciation and amortization expense, as well as stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, represents net income (loss) before net interest, other expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation and non-cash changes in fair value of contingent consideration and impairments of goodwill, intangible, and other long-lived assets, if any. Adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please refer to \u201cSelected Consolidated Financial Data-Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the limitations of adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBITDA and reconciliations of adjusted gross margin to gross margin and adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable GAAP measurements, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe derive most of our revenue from software services fees, which primarily consist of monthly subscription fees paid to us for access to, usage and hosting of our web-based insurance distribution software solutions, and related production support services.\nSoftware services fees paid to us from our Enterprise/Commercial customers are contracted rates based on the size of the health plan using our solutions for a specified period of time, which usually ranges from three to five years, and the number of software modules used. Software services fees paid to us from our Enterprise/State customers are contracted rates based on the number of software solutions modules being used for a specified period of time, which usually ranges from one to three years. Software services fees paid to us from our Medicare and Private Exchange customers are based on the volume of enrollments for which our software solutions are utilized for a contracted period, which usually ranges from one to three years. Our customer contracts are generally only cancellable by the customer in an instance of our uncured breach, although some of our customers are able to terminate their respective contracts without cause or for convenience. Software services revenue accounted for approximately 67%, 75% and 68% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nAnother component of our revenue is professional services, which we primarily derive from the implementation of our customers onto our platform, typically including discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing and training. We derive the majority of our professional services revenue from the implementation of our customers onto our platform. In general, it takes from six to fifteen months to implement a new enterprise customer's insurance distribution solution and from one to three months to implement a new Medicare or Private Exchange insurance distribution solution. Professional services revenue accounted for approximately 30%, 21% and 24% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe also derive a small portion of other revenue from commissions earned on annual employee enrollments in which our health plan network and software solutions are used in connection with each enrollment.\nFor all contractual arrangements that include multiple elements, we allocate revenue from a customer contract to software services and professional services based on the type of multiple element arrangement. For instance, with respect to multiple-element arrangements containing hosted software, we identify each software and professional services unit of accounting based on the terms of the customer contract and allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. Revenue from each element is recognized as each element is delivered. Similarly, for multiple-element arrangements containing non-hosted software, during the periods reported we accounted for the entire arrangement as a single unit of accounting, because some or all of the deliverable elements did not have stand-alone value when the related contracts were executed. In these situations, all revenue has been deferred until delivery of the final element, at which time the contract value is recognized ratably over the longer of the contract or estimated period of customer benefit. For purposes of presentation in management's discussion and analysis, management classifies a portion of the overall arrangement fee as software and professional services fees based on an evaluation of various available indicators of fair value, including relative contract value of the software and professional services elements to total contractual value, and applies judgment to reasonably classify the arrangement fee. Our classification of multiple element arrangement fees does not affect the timing or amount of revenue recognized.\nWe generally invoice our customers for software services in advance, in monthly, quarterly or annual installments. We typically invoice our Medicare and Private Exchange customers for implementation fees at the inception of the arrangement. We generally invoice our Enterprise/Commercial and Enterprise/State customers for implementation fees at various contractually defined times throughout the implementation process. Implementation fees that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue until recognized.\nOverhead Allocation\nExpenses associated with our facilities and depreciation are allocated between cost of revenue and operating expenses based on employee payroll costs determined by the nature of work performed.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, for employees providing services to our customers and supporting our Enterprise or SaaS platform infrastructures. Additional expenses in cost of revenue include co-location facility costs for our data centers, depreciation expense for computer equipment directly associated with generating revenue, infrastructure maintenance costs, amortization expenses associated with deferred implementation costs and acquired intangible assets, allocated overhead and other direct costs.\nOur cost of revenue is expensed as we incur the costs, with the exception of certain direct, incremental costs associated with new customer implementation efforts, which we defer. The related revenue from fees we receive for our implementation services performed before a customer is operating on our platform is deferred until the commencement of the monthly subscription and recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the related contract term or the estimated period of customer benefit. Therefore, certain costs incurred in providing these services can be expensed in periods prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Our cost associated with providing implementation services has been significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost associated with providing our monthly subscription services due to the labor associated with providing implementation services.\nWe plan to continue to expand our capacity to support our growth, which will result in higher cost of revenue in dollars. However, we expect cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to decline and gross margins to increase primarily from the growth of the percentage of our revenue from software services and the realization of economies of scale driven by retention of our customers.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Salaries and personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories. We expect to continue to hire new employees in these areas in order to support our anticipated revenue growth. As a result, we expect our operating expenses to increase in both aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the near term, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term as we achieve economies of scale.\nResearch and development expense. The nature of our research and development activities includes market requirements and definition, product design, software development, quality assurance and product release. Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation for our research and development employees. Additional expenses include costs related to the development, quality assurance, and testing of new technology, and enhancement of our existing platform technology, consulting, travel and allocated overhead. We believe continuing to invest in research and development efforts is essential to maintaining our competitive position. We expect our research and development expense to increase in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the near term, but decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term as we achieve economies of scale.\nSales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and commissions for our sales and marketing employees. We record expense for commissions at the time of contract signing. Additional expenses include advertising, lead generation, promotional event programs, corporate communications, travel and allocated overhead. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in both dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the foreseeable future as we further increase the number of our sales and marketing employees and expand our marketing activities in order to continue to grow our business.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation for administrative, finance and accounting, legal, information technology and human resource employees. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, insurance and other corporate expenses, and travel. Our general and administrative expenses have, and we expect that they will continue to, increase as a result of operating as a public company and include costs associated with compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations governing public companies, increased costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance, increased professional services expenses and costs associated with an enhanced investor relations function.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses primarily consists of interest expense incurred on outstanding borrowings under our financing obligations, existing notes and credit facilities.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\nIncome taxes primarily consist of United States federal and state income tax net operating loss benefits, net of changes in valuation allowances. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.\nOur income tax (expense) benefit was not meaningful in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. We recorded a net income tax benefit of approximately $0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. The benefit in 2013 resulted primarily from a $1.2 million benefit realized related to the change in our estimate of the Company deferred tax assets, which, as a result of the January 2013 acquisition of DRX, we believe are more likely than not to be realized.\nAs a result of cumulative net operating losses, we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $87.9 million as of December 31, 2015. State net operating loss carryforwards were approximately $56.5 million as of December 31, 2015. Our net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in 2020, if not utilized. As a result of prior equity issuances and other transactions in our stock, we have previously experienced \u201cownership changes\u201d under Section 382 which limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards available to us. We may also experience ownership changes in the future, which may result in further limitation of the amount of net operating losses which may be available in future years. At December 31, 2015 we had a full tax valuation allowance offsetting the recorded tax benefit of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards.\nResults of Operations\nStatements of

The decrease in our Enterprise/State revenue was primarily attributable to the third quarter 2014 termination of a state exchange contract and the third quarter 2015 non-renewal of a state exchange customer, resulting in a reduction of subsequent software and professional services revenue. The growth in our Medicare revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in software services and professional services as a result of an increase in customers. The growth in our Private Exchange revenue was primarily attributable to a $2.6 million growth in software services revenue as a result of an increase in both customers and revenue per customer.\nThe Enterprise/State segment had one remaining state exchange customer at December 31, 2015, compared to three in the comparative year.

We also experienced a $1.0 million increase in capitalization of new customer deferred implementation costs compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSegment Gross Margin\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Segment Gross Margin:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Enterprise/Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,392 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Enterprise/State\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,038 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,738 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42.9 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicare\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Private Exchange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>237.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Gross Margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The Enterprise/Commercial gross margin increase consisted of a $15.1 million increase in revenue and $1.7 million increase in cost of revenue. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to recognition of previously deferred revenue related to software implementations and ancillary professional services upon the satisfaction of remaining contractual obligations and $3.6 million second quarter 2015 accelerated recognition of revenue from the termination of our contractual relationship with two Enterprise/Commercial customers. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a $6.9 million increase in the recognition of previously deferred costs related to software implementations, which is inclusive of $2.6 million of accelerated amortization related to the second quarter 2015 termination of our contractual relationship with the two Enterprise/Commercial customers, partially offset by a $4.5 million reduction in direct labor, outside contractor costs, and related travel following the completion of our efforts related to the October 1, 2013 ACA rollout and a $0.7 million reduction in deferred implementation cost capitalization and other expenses compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our Enterprise/Commercial gross margin included $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of depreciation and amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nThe Enterprise/State gross margin decrease consisted of a $8.3 million decrease in revenue and a corresponding $3.5 million decrease in cost of revenue. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to the third quarter 2014 termination of a state exchange contract and the third quarter 2015 non-renewal of a state exchange customer, resulting in a reduction of subsequent software and professional services revenue. The reduction in costs of revenue relate to staffing realignment efforts consistent with current and expected future needs of our Enterprise/State segment. Our Enterprise/State gross margin included less than $0.1 million of depreciation and amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nThe Medicare gross margin increase consisted of a $1.8 million increase in revenue and $0.6 million increase in cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to personnel-related cost increases to support current and anticipated growth in this segment. Our Medicare gross margin included $2.5 million of depreciation and amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nThe Private Exchange gross margin increase consisted of a $2.6 million increase in revenue and $0.6 million decrease in cost of revenue. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a $1.3 million one-time gain on extinguishment of a vendor obligation offset by a $0.7 million increase in personnel-related and other costs to support current and anticipated customer growth in this segment. Our Private Exchange gross margin included $0.9 million and $0.8 million of depreciation and amortization in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nResearch and Development\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and Development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,718 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> The increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to a $3.5 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, due to additional research and development efforts. Additionally, we experienced a $1.1 million increase in engineering consulting fees and other expenses for product development.\nThe increased research and development spending during the year ended December 31, 2015, was a continuation of our efforts to invest in a common software platform intended to reduce future software implementation and maintenance costs and increase margins. We expect these efforts will benefit our Enterprise Commercial and Private Exchange segments. Additionally, we continued development of new software solutions intended to take advantage of opportunities within our customer base and the emerging private exchange market.\nWhile we expect to continue our research and development investment in new software solutions and functionality, we believe such expense will decline over time to our long-term target of under twenty percent of revenue.\nSales and Marketing\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and Marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to a $1.2 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs due to hiring of additional sales employees and a $0.6 million increase in other expenses, of which $0.2 million was attributed to our 2015 Client Forum event.\nGeneral and Administrative\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and Administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to $2.2 million of incremental costs associated with being a public company and $0.3 million related to the 2015 transition of chief executive officer responsibilities.

customer implementations completed in fourth quarter of 2013, with majority of the growth from our Enterprise/State segment. Our professional services revenue increased due to revenue recognition from newly completed implementations.\nFor all arrangements that include multiple elements, the allocation of revenue from a customer contract to software services and professional services is based on the type of multiple-element arrangement. For multiple-element arrangements containing hosted software, we identify each software and professional services unit of accounting based on the terms of the customer contract and allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. Revenue from each element is recognized as each element is delivered. For multiple-element arrangements containing non-hosted software, during the periods reported we accounted for the entire arrangement as a single unit of accounting, because some or all of the deliverable elements did not have stand-alone value when the related contracts were executed. In these situations, all revenue has been deferred until delivery of the final element, at which time the contract value is recognized ratably over the longer of the contract or estimated period of customer benefit. Less than 30% of our consolidated revenues in each of the periods ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 had multiple-element arrangements containing non-hosted software.\nSegment Revenue\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue by Segment:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Enterprise/Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Enterprise/State\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,632 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>580.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicare\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Private Exchange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The growth in our Enterprise/Commercial revenue was primarily attributable to an $8.5 million increase in our software services revenue driven by an increase in the number of health plan customers using our platform as of December 31, 2014, as compared to December 31, 2013, offset by a $1.1 million decrease in professional services revenue.

increase in Enterprise/Commercial revenue, and a $3.7 million decrease in Enterprise/Commercial cost of revenue. The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to recognition of previously deferred revenue on software that is implemented, which increased due to new health plan customer implementations completed in 2014 along with a full years' revenue on those implementations completed in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our Enterprise/Commercial gross margin included $0.4 million and $0.5 million of depreciation and amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nEnterprise/State gross margin increased by $12.2 million and was driven primarily by a $18.5 million increase in Enterprise/State revenue, partially offset by a $6.3 million increase in Enterprise/State cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is primarily attributable to amortization of previously deferred implementation costs related to new customer implementations that were completed in the fourth quarter of 2013 and throughout 2014, along with $0.7 million of accelerated deferred cost amortization related to the termination of a state exchange contract in the third quarter of 2014. Our Enterprise/State gross margin included $0.1 million in depreciation and amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nMedicare gross margin increased by $1.6 million and was driven primarily by a $0.2 million increase in Medicare revenue and $1.4 million decrease in Medicare cost of revenue. The decrease in cost of revenue is primarily attributable to a decrease in personnel costs. Our Medicare gross margin included $2.5 million and $2.4 million in depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nPrivate Exchange gross margin decreased by $0.8 million and was driven by a $1.1 million increase in Private Exchange cost of revenue, offset by a $0.2 million increase in Private Exchange revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in personnel costs to support new customer implementation efforts. Our Private Exchange gross margin included $0.8 million in depreciation and amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe negative gross margins recorded in the Enterprise/Commercial and Enterprise/State reportable segments during the year ended December 31, 2013 were primarily caused by the amount of indirect labor and overhead in cost of revenue that indirectly support future revenue, but which may not be deferred and capitalized to \u201cdeferred implementation costs\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet. Specifically, in both reportable segments, the Company experienced a significant level of new customer implementation activity (more than 30 software implementations during the period reported). The Company deferred the corresponding implementation services revenue and direct costs associated with those implementations, but expensed the associated indirect labor and overhead in cost of revenue. As the Enterprise/Commercial and Enterprise/State software implementations were completed during the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, the Company started amortizing the deferred\nrevenue and related deferred implementation costs associated with these implementations. The transition from a period of implementing software with no revenue to a period of customer software usage and revenue recognition is a key driver of the change from the negative gross margins recorded in the Enterprise/Commercial and Enterprise/State reportable segments during the year ended December 31, 2013 to positive gross margins in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nResearch and Development\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and Development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> The increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to a $4.2 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, due to additional research and development headcount. Additionally, we experienced a $1.1 million increase in engineering consulting fees for assistance in product development and $1.0 million related primarily to increases in facilities and travel costs driven by an increase in headcount.\nThe increased research and development spending has resulted in expanded product capabilities with our Private Exchange software solution, which has translated into new customer contracts and revenue opportunities, and productivity enhancements via reduced implementation cycle times in our Enterprise/Commercial software solutions, which we anticipate will lead to lower implementation costs in future periods. The increased expenditures have also resulted in expanded product capabilities within our Enterprise/State solution that allow us to pursue sales opportunities in new markets and improve Medicare shopping, enrollment and member engagement software capabilities, which we expect will lead to incremental sales in future periods.\nSales and Marketing\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and Marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> The increase in sales and marketing expense in dollars was primarily attributable to a $0.8 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, due to sales employees hired in 2014 to continue driving revenue growth.\nGeneral and Administrative\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and Administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>($ </td> <td>1,635 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.4 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table> The decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a $1.0 million benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the decrease in fair value of the DestinationRx contingent acquisition consideration, a $0.7 million decrease in consulting and professional fees directly related to the 2013\nacquisition and integration of DRX into our business and a $0.4 million benefit from the settlement of a number of sales and use tax contingencies in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in other expenses.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing in Part II, Item 8: \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(B)(1), which will allow us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe derive our revenue primarily from the following sources: (a) the sale, implementation and ongoing support of our insurance distribution solutions; (b) fees from brokers for the right to access our multi-payer quoting platform; (c) our Medicare.gov contract, which was a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract through the fourth quarter of 2015; and (d) commissions earned on annual employee enrollments in which our health plan network and software solutions are used in connection with each enrollment. In all contractual arrangements, we determine whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. If any of these criteria are not met, the Company does not recognize revenue until all of the criteria are met.\nWe have multiple sources of revenue, which fall under different sets of revenue recognition rules including accounting for revenue under hosted and non-hosted arrangements and percentage of completion accounting. The\ndetermination of whether the contract meets the definition of software and the corresponding separability of the elements and fair value assessments require judgment.\nWe recognize revenue for upfront license and implementation fees over the longer of the term of the customer agreement or the estimated period of customer benefit based on various factors including, but not limited to, contract terms, contract extensions and renewals, customer attrition, the nature and pace of technology advancements and obsolescence, and the anticipated impact of demand, competition, and other regulatory and economic factors.\nMost of our deferred revenue relates to professional services performed for our Enterprise/Commercial and Enterprise/State customers, which require a more extensive and lengthy implementation. We expect to continue to evaluate the term over which our Enterprise/Commercial implementation fee revenue is recognized as we gain more experience with customer contract renewals.\nAt December 31, 2015, deferred revenue related to the Enterprise/Commercial segment was $39.1 million and is being recognized in our statements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately three years. If the weighted average period had been increased by one year to four years, the Enterprise/Commercial revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 would have decreased by approximately $5.0 million.\nAt December 31, 2015, deferred revenue related to the single Enterprise/State customer was approximately $4.5 million and is being recognized in our statement of operations over a remaining period of approximately 1.5 years.\nDeferred Implementation Costs\nWe capitalize certain direct, incremental costs associated with new customer implementation efforts, and we account for those costs as deferred implementation costs, to the extent that they are deemed recoverable. We had $24.6 million of deferred implementation costs recorded as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Deferred implementation costs are amortized consistent with the recognition of deferred revenue. The deferred implementation cost balance is subject to periodic impairment evaluation to determine recoverability of the asset. At every reporting period, we evaluate the recoverability of the deferred implementation costs, factoring in the remaining implementation schedule, estimated cost to complete the implementation effort and the probability of revenue in excess of deferred costs capitalized.\nGoodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 31, or more frequently if events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nWe test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level using a two-step approach. In step one, we determine if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the unit's carrying value. If step one indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform step two, determining the fair value of goodwill and, if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, recording an impairment charge.\nWe have three reporting units with goodwill, Enterprise/Commercial, Medicare, and Private Exchange; the Enterprise/Commercial, Medicare, and Private Exchange reporting units have $7.7 million, $14.7 million, and $4.3 million of goodwill, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use a discounted cash flow analysis which requires significant assumptions and estimates about future operations. Significant judgments inherent in this discounted cash flow analysis include the expected\nrevenue growth and operating margins and the determination of an appropriate discount rate. Each reporting unit had greater than $1.3 million excess fair value over carrying value as of our last assessment.\nWe review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value.\nGiven the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe fund our operations primarily through cash from operating activities and bank and subordinated debt borrowings. As of December 31, 2015, we have cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 million which is held for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to develop new technologies, fund capital expenditures, make investments in or acquisitions of other businesses, solutions or technologies or repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our policy is to invest any cash in excess of our immediate requirements in investments designed to preserve the principal balance and provide liquidity. Accordingly, our cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in demand deposit and money market accounts that are currently providing only a minimal return.\nIn December 2014, we completed an initial public offering in which we issued and sold 6,635,000 shares of our common stock and existing shareholders sold 995,250 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.00 per share. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the existing shareholders. We received net proceeds of $45.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other direct offering expenses, which were available for general corporate purposes. Prior to our initial public offering, we funded our operations primarily through cash from operating activities, bank and subordinated debt borrowings and the private issuance of equity securities.\nSenior Credit Facility\nOn January 15, 2013, we entered into a bank credit facility to provide for short-term working capital and long-term investment needs, or the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility initially provided for $22.5 million of term loans, or Senior Term Loans, and $5.0 million of revolving credit, or the Senior Revolving Credit Facility, through January 15, 2018, or the Maturity Date. The Senior Term Loans require quarterly principal payments of $0.3 million commencing on March 31, 2013, with the unpaid principal balance payable in full on the Maturity Date. On March 12, 2014, we amended the Credit Facility to, among other things, increase the Senior Revolving Credit Facility by $5.0 million to $10.0 million.\nThe Senior Term Loans accrue interest at a rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a LIBOR margin payable monthly. The Senior Revolving Credit Facility accrues interest monthly at a rate based on LIBOR, the Fed Funds Rate or bank's Prime Rate. As of December 31, 2015, the interest rates on the outstanding Senior Term Loans and Senior Revolving Credit Facility advances were 5.9% to 8.0%.\nThe Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Company, as well as various limitations on the activities of the Company as they relate to additional indebtedness, junior liens, investments, capital expenditures, and mergers and acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we amended the Credit Facility to establish the 2015 and 2016 financial covenants, including a quarterly building EBITDA covenant and a minimum liquidity covenant. The quarterly building EBITDA covenant sets forth\nspecific levels of cumulative trailing twelve month EBITDA measured on calendar quarter ends. The quarterly building EBITDA covenant increases from $3.5 million for the measurement period ending March 31, 2015 to $8.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2015, and ranges from $5.9 million to $9.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2016. The minimum liquidity covenant requires us to maintain a minimum liquidity level of $7.5 million as of December 31, 2015, $5.0 million until June 30, 2016, and $7.5 million subsequent to that. Minimum liquidity is defined as the sum of cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity available to us under the $10.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility. The minimum liquidity covenant expires once we achieve a Fixed Coverage Ratio, as defined, in excess of 1.25:1.00 for two consecutive quarters. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with financial covenants, and we expect to be in compliance with the 2016 financial covenants.\nSubordinated Loans\nOn March 18, 2013, we entered into a Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement with THL Corporate Finance, Inc., or the THL Note, for total proceeds of $10.0 million less $0.2 million of original issue discount, or OID, to finance the repayment of the $6.0 million subordinated promissory notes and to fund working capital needs. The THL Note maturity date is July 15, 2018, with the principal balance payable in full at the maturity date.\nIn the first half of 2014, we amended the THL Note to, among other things, provide $20.0 million of additional subordinated term note financing through July 2018. The $20.0 million additional financing was reduced by approximately $0.5 million of original issue discount.\nInterest on the THL Note accrues at a variable rate of LIBOR plus a LIBOR margin, and is payable monthly. As of December 31, 2015, the rate was 12.0% and the outstanding balance, net of OID, was $29.6 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we amended the THL Note to establish 2015 and 2016 financial covenants, including a quarterly building EBITDA covenant and a minimum liquidity covenant. The quarterly building EBITDA covenant sets forth specific levels of cumulative trailing twelve month EBITDA measured on calendar quarter ends. The quarterly building EBITDA covenant increases from $2.6 million for the measurement period ending March 31, 2015 to $7.7 million for the year ending December 31, 2015, and ranges from $5.3 million to $8.6 million for the year ending December 31, 2016. The minimum liquidity covenant requires us to maintain a minimum liquidity level of $6.8 million as of December 31, 2015, $4.5 million until June 30, 2016, $6.8 million until September 30, 2016, and $9.0 million subsequent to that. Minimum liquidity is defined as the sum of cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity available to us under the $10.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility. The minimum liquidity covenant expires once we achieve a Fixed Coverage Ratio in excess of 1.25:1.00 for two consecutive quarters. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with our financial covenants, and we expect to be in compliance with the 2016 financial covenants.\nOn January 15, 2013, we entered into a subordinated promissory note with the sellers of DRX, or the DRX Seller Note. The DRX Seller Note accrued interest at a rate of 8.0% payable upon the January 15, 2015 maturity date. In 2015, the Company repaid the DRX Seller Note and accrued interest.\nThe following table summarizes the principal balances of our outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Outstanding </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Principal Balance </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility: Revolving line of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>316 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility: Term loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,441 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> We believe that cash from operations, the proceeds from our offering, cash on hand and available capacity under our Credit Facility will provide liquidity to meet anticipated future short term capital requirements for the next twelve months. The sufficiency of these liquidity sources to fund necessary and committed capital needs will be dependent upon our ability to meet our covenant requirements of our Credit Facility. See the section titled \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources-Senior Credit Facility\u201d for a description of our Credit Facility.\nIn the future, we may seek to access the capital markets to raise additional equity financing for various business reasons, including required debt payments and acquisitions. The timing, term, size, and pricing of any such financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing. In addition, if we are unable to comply with our debt covenants in the future and as a result default on our loan agreements, approximately $49.4 million of our outstanding borrowings would become immediately payable, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nDividends on Preferred Stock\nIn connection with the completion of our initial public offering, all then outstanding Series A and B preferred stock were converted into common stock on a three-for-one basis, and $9.0 million of accrued dividends were paid in cash.\nCash Flows\nOur cash flows were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash flows (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,192 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20,253 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,702 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,317 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(837 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27,096 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,319 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,065 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,195 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(22,828 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,975 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>801 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Operating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our net cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities of $16.2 million consisted of a net loss of $7.3 million and $19.4 million of cash used by changes in working capital, offset by $10.6 million in adjustments for non-cash items. The decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of a decrease in deferred revenue of $21.2 million. The decrease in deferred revenue was a result of recognizing previously deferred upfront fees which are recognized as revenue ratably\nover the longer of the estimated period of customer benefit or contract, beginning once the software services have commenced.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our net cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities of $20.3 million consisted of a net loss of $10.2 million and $17.7 million of cash used by changes in working capital, partially offset by $7.6 million in adjustments for non-cash items. The cash used by changes in working capital primarily consisted of a decrease in deferred revenue of $14.1 million. The decrease in deferred revenue was a result of contracts closed during prior periods with associated upfront fees, on which we began recognizing revenue ratably as implementations were completed and software services have commenced.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities of $1.7 million consisted of a net loss of $26.4 million partially offset by $21.4 million of cash provided by changes in working capital and $6.7 million in adjustments for non-cash items. The cash provided by changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $41.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in operating cash flow due to a $11.3 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in deferred revenue was a result of contracts closed during the period with associated upfront fees, which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the customer contract period beginning once the software services have commenced. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to the growth of our revenue and fees invoiced for the period.\nA substantial amount of revenue in a period comes from the recognition of previously collected and deferred revenue, while period-end accounts receivable balances are directly influenced by the timing of contractually negotiated milestone and time-based advance billings and their subsequent collection. We generally have the contractual right to invoice and collect fees from customers ahead of delivery and revenue recognition of our software and professional services.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $1.3 million, for the purchase of property and equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $0.8 million, for the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $27.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. We spent $25.9 million on the acquisition of DRX, net of cash acquired. In addition, we spent $1.2 million to purchase property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $5.3 million for 2015, consisting of $4.8 million in repayments of debt and capital lease obligations, $0.7 million in payments of offering costs related to our December 2014 IPO, offset by $0.3 million in net proceeds from employee stock option transactions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $47.1 million, consisting of $45.9 million of proceeds from our initial public offering, net of issuance costs, and $32.8 million in proceeds from credit facility and term-debt borrowings partially offset by $19.6 million of debt and capital lease obligation payments, $9.0 million of dividends on preferred stock, $2.3 million of deferred business acquisition purchase price and $0.7 million of financing fees paid.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash provided by financing activities was $26.2 million, consisting of $39.9 million in proceeds from credit facility and term-debt borrowings, partially offset by $12.3 million of repayments of debt and capital lease obligations and $1.2 million of financing fees paid.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, and the availability on our revolving line of credit on our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months, including expected capital expenditure requirements of approximately $1.0 million to $2.0 million. If our available cash and cash equivalents balances are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities or enter into an additional credit facility. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities, these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. We may require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.\nQuarterly Trends and Seasonality\nOur overall operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are out of our control. These fluctuations are primarily driven by an increase in the third and fourth quarters in activity at our customers in preparation for and during the annual insurance enrollment cycle, which occurs annually during our fourth quarter. Our historical results should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future results of operations.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our outstanding debt facilities, non-cancelable leases for our office space and computer equipment, purchase commitments for our co-location and other support services. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these estimates.\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt-Revolving line of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt-Other senior and subordinated\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,698 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,624 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,056 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,197 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,197 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Repayment of the revolving line of credit is due at end of the term in January 2018.

The closing of the offering is subject to customary closing conditions and approval of our stockholders at our annual\nmeeting, and is expected to occur at the end of April 2016. If the closing has not occurred on or before June 30, 2016, the Investment Agreement may be terminated by us or the Investors. In addition, the agreement may be terminated by mutual written agreement or upon uncured material breach. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to the financing.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had standby letters of credit totaling $0.2 million as security for rented office space.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on new accounting standards.\nJOBS Act\nThe JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As defined in the JOBS Act, a public company whose initial public offering of common equity securities occurred after December 8, 2011 and whose annual gross revenue is less than $1.0 billion will, in general, qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of:\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the last day of its fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of its initial public offering of common equity securities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the last day of its fiscal year in which it has annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the date on which it has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the date on which it is deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d which will occur at such time as the company (a) has an aggregate worldwide market value of common equity securities held by non-affiliates of $700 million or more as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (b) has been required to file annual and quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for a period of at least 12 months and (c) has filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Securities Act of 1934. </td> </tr>\n</table> Under this definition, we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and could remain an emerging growth company until as late as December 31, 2019.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we have chosen to rely on such exemptions and are therefore not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis).\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of relative fair value of the contractual elements.

Our solutions support the industry evolution towards a consumer-centric experience that is transforming how health insurance is purchased and distributed. Our solutions offer personalized health insurance shopping experience that recommends the best fit insurance plan based on an individual's preferences, health status, preferred providers, medications and expected out-of-pocket costs. Our customers are health insurance marketplace operators, such as health plans, brokers, and exchange operators that must distribute health insurance in a cost-effective manner to a growing number of insured consumers. Our solutions automate key functions in the health insurance distribution process, allowing our customers to price and present plan options accurately to consumers and efficiently enroll, renew and manage plan members.\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Millions of Dollars </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TOTAL\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a $3.4 million decrease in professional fees to outside contractors, a $0.9 million decrease in salaries and personnel-related costs and a $1.8 million decrease in other costs primarily related to a decrease in outside call center, travel and facilities costs. Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2015 we amortized an additional $5.4 million of previously deferred implementation costs, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, of which $2.6 million was accelerated amortization related to the two above-mentioned second quarter 2015 Enterprise/Commercial customer terminations. We also experienced a $1.0 million increase in capitalization of new customer deferred implementation costs compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\n Growth in software services revenue was primarily attributable to the recognition of full years' worth of software service revenues related to customer implementations completed in fourth quarter of 2013, with majority of the growth from our Enterprise/State segment. Our professional services revenue increased due to revenue recognition from newly completed implementations.\nOn March 11, 2016, we entered into an Investment Agreement with certain accredited investors, or the Investors, including funds affiliated with one of our directors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue an aggregate of 52,000 shares of our newly-authorized Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at a price per share of $1,000.00, in a private placement transaction, or the Private Placement, in reliance on the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act, and Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.

consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 31, or more frequently if events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nWe have generally signed multiple-year subscription contracts for our software services. The timing of our invoices to our customer is a negotiated term and thus varies among our software contracts. For multiple-year agreements, it is common to invoice an initial amount at contract signing for implementation work that is deferred, followed by subsequent annual, quarterly or monthly invoices once we launch a customer, which is when our product is usable by the customer. At any point in the contract term, there may be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements and are considered by us to be Contracted Backlog. The amount of our total Contracted Backlog for software services and professional services contracts, which we define as including both cancellable and non-cancellable portions of our customer agreements that we have not yet billed, was approximately $89.7 million and $78.2 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We fulfill Contracted Backlog associated with a customer contract when the customer implementation process is complete. Our implementation timelines can vary between one and 15 months based on the type of solution, source and condition of the data we receive from third parties, the configurations that we agree to provide and the size of the customer. As a result, our implementation timelines are subject to significant uncertainties, which can have a material impact on our total Contracted Backlog and Contracted Backlog that we fulfill in the current year. Based on our current implementation forecasts, we expect to fulfill our total Contracted Backlog as of December 31, 2015 over a period of approximately four years.\nExpenses associated with our facilities and depreciation are allocated between cost of revenue and operating expenses based on employee payroll costs determined by the nature of work performed.\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and Administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2015, deferred revenue related to the Enterprise/Commercial segment was $39.1 million and is being recognized in our statements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately three years.

Software services revenue accounted for approximately 67%, 75% and 68% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nResearch and Development\nThe increased research and development spending during the year ended December 31, 2015, was a continuation of our efforts to invest in a common software platform intended to reduce future software implementation and maintenance costs and increase margins. We expect these efforts will benefit our Enterprise Commercial and Private Exchange segments. Additionally, we continued development of new software solutions intended to take advantage of opportunities within our customer base and the emerging private exchange market.\nTable 156: <table> <tr>

The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to personnel-related cost increases to support current and anticipated growth in this segment. Our Medicare gross margin included $2.5 million of depreciation and amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nResearch and development expense. The nature of our research and development activities includes market requirements and definition, product design, software development, quality assurance and product release. Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation for our research and development employees. Additional expenses include costs related to the development, quality assurance, and testing of new technology, and enhancement of our existing platform technology, consulting, travel and allocated overhead. We believe continuing to invest in research and development efforts is essential to maintaining our competitive position. We expect our research and development expense to increase in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the near term, but decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term as we achieve economies of scale.\nComponents of Operating Results\nResults of Operations\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Period-to-Period Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,431 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n The Enterprise/Commercial gross margin increase consisted of a $15.1 million increase in revenue and $1.7 million increase in cost of revenue. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to recognition of previously deferred revenue related to software implementations and ancillary professional services upon the satisfaction of remaining contractual obligations and $3.6 million second quarter 2015 accelerated recognition of revenue from the termination of our contractual relationship with two Enterprise/Commercial customers. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a $6.9 million increase in the recognition of previously deferred costs related to software implementations, which is inclusive of $2.6 million of accelerated amortization related to the second quarter 2015 termination of our contractual relationship with the two Enterprise/Commercial customers, partially offset by a $4.5 million reduction in direct labor, outside contractor costs, and related travel following the completion of our efforts related to the October 1, 2013 ACA rollout and a $0.7 million reduction in deferred implementation cost capitalization and other expenses compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.

We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the existing shareholders. We received net proceeds of $45.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other direct offering expenses, which were available for general corporate purposes.

customer implementations and a $4.6 million increase in amortization of previously deferred implementation costs, partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in salaries and personnel-related costs associated with 2014 staffing realignments, a $4.6 million decrease in professional fees to outside contractors utilized to support customer implementation services and a decrease of approximately $1.6 million primarily related to reduced travel expenses to customer sites and hosting expenses to support our platforms.\nThe anticipated impact of the December 31, 2015 Contracted Backlog on each future year is as follows:\nKey Financial and Operating Performance Metrics\n The increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to a $4.2 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, due to additional research and development headcount. Additionally, we experienced a $1.1 million increase in engineering consulting fees for assistance in product development and $1.0 million related primarily to increases in facilities and travel costs driven by an increase in headcount.\n\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

amortization expense, as well as stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, represents net income (loss) before net interest, other expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation and non-cash changes in fair value of contingent consideration and impairments of goodwill, intangible, and other long-lived assets, if any. Adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please refer to \u201cSelected Consolidated Financial Data-Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the limitations of adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBITDA and reconciliations of adjusted gross margin to gross margin and adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable GAAP measurements, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nThe JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As defined in the JOBS Act, a public company whose initial public offering of common equity securities occurred after December 8, 2011 and whose annual gross revenue is less than $1.0 billion will, in general, qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of:\nThe Private Exchange gross margin increase consisted of a $2.6 million increase in revenue and $0.6 million decrease in cost of revenue. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a $1.3 million one-time gain on extinguishment of a vendor obligation offset by a $0.7 million increase in personnel-related and other costs to support current and anticipated customer growth in this segment. Our Private Exchange gross margin included $0.9 million and $0.8 million of depreciation and amortization in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nContracted Backlog\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSales and Marketing\nManagement is focused on risks that could have an adverse impact on our operations and our key financial and operating performance metrics, as described below, and takes actions to mitigate those risks. In our Enterprise/Commercial segment, for example, while fluctuations in bookings are not uncommon given the sales cycle for product and services in that segment, management routinely assesses staffing levels required to support contracted business volume and adjusts staffing levels accordingly. As part of its ongoing assessment of our software capabilities, management also considers industry trends, such as consumers' increased reliance on mobile devices, to determine where to allocate research and development funding. One of our overall strategic initiatives is to continue to increase the percentage of software services revenue (and reduce professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue) as we believe this will have a positive impact on overall gross margins in the future.\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe Senior Term Loans accrue interest at a rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a LIBOR margin payable monthly. The Senior Revolving Credit Facility accrues interest monthly at a rate based on LIBOR, the Fed Funds Rate or bank's Prime Rate. As of December 31, 2015, the interest rates on the outstanding Senior Term Loans and Senior Revolving Credit Facility advances were 5.9% to 8.0%.\n The increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to a $3.5 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, due to additional research and development efforts. Additionally, we experienced a $1.1 million increase in engineering consulting fees and other expenses for product development.\nWe sell our web-based solutions and related services primarily through our direct sales force. We derive most of our revenue from software services fees, which primarily consist of monthly subscription fees paid to us for access to, usage and hosting of our web-based insurance distribution software solutions, and related production support services. Software services fees paid to us from our Enterprise/Commercial customers are based on the size of the health plan for a specified period of time, which usually ranges from three to five years, and the number of software modules used. Software services fees paid to our Enterprise/State segment are based on the number of software solutions modules contracted to be used, for a specified period of time, which usually ranges from one to three years. Software services fees paid to us from our Medicare and Private Exchange customers are based on the volume of enrollments for which our software solutions are utilized for a contracted period, which usually ranges from one to three years.\nSoftware Revenue Retention Rate\nIn the first half of 2014, we amended the THL Note to, among other things, provide $20.0 million of additional subordinated term note financing through July 2018. The $20.0 million additional financing was reduced by approximately $0.5 million of original issue discount.\n\n The growth in our Enterprise/Commercial revenue was primarily attributable to an $8.5 million increase in our software services revenue driven by an increase in the number of health plan customers using our platform as of December 31, 2014, as compared to December 31, 2013, offset by a $1.1 million decrease in professional services revenue. The growth in our Enterprise/State revenue was primarily attributable to an increase of $9.4 million in software services revenue, and a $4.2 million increase in professional services revenue, driven primarily by revenue recognized from new customer implementations completed in the fourth quarter of 2013, along with $4.9 million of accelerated revenue recognition related to a termination of a state exchange contract in the third quarter of 2014. The growth in our Medicare and Private Exchange revenue was primarily attributable to a $2.8 million increase in software services revenue driven by an increase in the number of health plan and broker customers using our platform as of December 31, 2014 as compared to December 31, 2013, offset by a $1.5 million decrease in professional services revenue and $0.8 million in other revenue.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we have chosen to rely on such exemptions and are therefore not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis).\nOperating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Salaries and personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories. We expect to continue to hire new employees in these areas in order to support our anticipated revenue growth. As a result, we expect our operating expenses to increase in both aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the near term, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term as we achieve economies of scale.\nThe Enterprise/State gross margin decrease consisted of a $8.3 million decrease in revenue and a corresponding $3.5 million decrease in cost of revenue. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to the third quarter 2014 termination of a state exchange contract and the third quarter 2015 non-renewal of a state exchange customer, resulting in a reduction of subsequent software and professional services revenue. The reduction in costs of revenue relate to staffing realignment efforts consistent with current and expected future needs of our Enterprise/State segment. Our Enterprise/State gross margin included less than $0.1 million of depreciation and amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOur customer contracts are generally only cancellable by the customer in an instance of our uncured breach, although some of our customers (including government customers) are able to terminate their respective contracts without cause or for convenience. Of our top 20 customers by 2015 revenue, some customers can terminate their contract for convenience upon written notice of between 30 and 60 days. These customers represented $20.2 million, or 22.5% of our Contracted Backlog balance as of December 31, 2015.\nPrivate Exchange gross margin decreased by $0.8 million and was driven by a $1.1 million increase in Private Exchange cost of revenue, offset by a $0.2 million increase in Private Exchange revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in personnel costs to support new customer implementation efforts. Our Private Exchange gross margin included $0.8 million in depreciation and amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and project our future performance. These metrics help us develop and refine our growth strategies and make strategic decisions. We discuss consolidated revenue, gross margin and the components of operating loss, as well as segment revenue and components of segment gross margin, in \u201cManagement's Discussion and\nWe capitalize certain direct, incremental costs associated with new customer implementation efforts, and we account for those costs as deferred implementation costs, to the extent that they are deemed recoverable. We had $24.6 million of deferred implementation costs recorded as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Deferred implementation costs are amortized consistent with the recognition of deferred revenue. The deferred implementation cost balance is subject to periodic impairment evaluation to determine recoverability of the asset. At every reporting period, we evaluate the recoverability of the deferred implementation costs, factoring in the remaining implementation schedule, estimated cost to complete the implementation effort and the probability of revenue in excess of deferred costs capitalized.\nInvesting Activities\nOn January 15, 2013, we entered into a subordinated promissory note with the sellers of DRX, or the DRX Seller Note. The DRX Seller Note accrued interest at a rate of 8.0% payable upon the January 15, 2015 maturity date. In 2015, the Company repaid the DRX Seller Note and accrued interest.\nCash Flows\n The increase in interest expense in dollars was primarily attributable to an increase in average borrowings outstanding and a higher weighted average cost of debt on our outstanding borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nWe generally invoice our customers for software services in advance, in monthly, quarterly or annual installments. We typically invoice our Medicare and Private Exchange customers for implementation fees at the inception of the arrangement. We generally invoice our Enterprise/Commercial and Enterprise/State customers for implementation fees at various contractually defined times throughout the implementation process. Implementation fees that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue until recognized.\nSenior Credit Facility\nRevenue Retention Rate by taking the amount of software revenue we recognized for this group in the subsequent comparable period (for which we are reporting the rate) and dividing it by the software revenue we recognized for the group in the prior period.\nGiven the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial statements.\n The growth in our Enterprise/Commercial revenue was primarily attributable to the year-over-year growth in customers implemented on our software solutions, the completion of more software services with existing customers, and the accelerated recognition of $3.6 million of revenue from the second quarter 2015 termination of our contractual relationships with two customers. The decrease in our Enterprise/State revenue was primarily attributable to the third quarter 2014 termination of a state exchange contract and the third quarter 2015 non-renewal of a state exchange customer, resulting in a reduction of subsequent software and professional services revenue. The growth in our Medicare revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in software services and professional services as a result of an increase in customers. The growth in our Private Exchange revenue was primarily attributable to a $2.6 million growth in software services revenue as a result of an increase in both customers and revenue per customer.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\nSales and Marketing\nSegment Gross Margin\n * Not meaningful  Enterprise/Commercial gross margin increased by $11.1 million and was driven primarily by a $7.3 million increase in Enterprise/Commercial revenue, and a $3.7 million decrease in Enterprise/Commercial cost of revenue. The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to recognition of previously deferred revenue on software that is implemented, which increased due to new health plan customer implementations completed in 2014 along with a full years' revenue on those implementations completed in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our Enterprise/Commercial gross margin included $0.4 million and $0.5 million of depreciation and amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative\nDividends on Preferred Stock\n (3) We defined adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest, other expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation and non-cash changes in fair value of contingent consideration and impairments of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets, if any. See the section titled \u201cAdjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA\u201d below for more information and for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to EBITDA, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue for each of the periods indicated:\nOur income tax (expense) benefit was not meaningful in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. We recorded a net income tax benefit of approximately $0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. The benefit in 2013 resulted primarily from a $1.2 million benefit realized related to the change in our estimate of the Company deferred tax assets, which, as a result of the January 2013 acquisition of DRX, we believe are more likely than not to be realized.\n \n \u2022 the date on which it has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and \nWe plan to continue to expand our capacity to support our growth, which will result in higher cost of revenue in dollars. However, we expect cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to decline and gross margins to increase primarily from the growth of the percentage of our revenue from software services and the realization of economies of scale driven by retention of our customers.\nIn connection with the completion of our initial public offering, all then outstanding Series A and B preferred stock were converted into common stock on a three-for-one basis, and $9.0 million of accrued dividends were paid in cash.\n The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in average borrowings outstanding and a lower weighted average cost of debt on our outstanding borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe following table summarizes the principal balances of our outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2015:\n Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our net cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities of $20.3 million consisted of a net loss of $10.2 million and $17.7 million of cash used by changes in working capital, partially offset by $7.6 million in adjustments for non-cash items. The cash used by changes in working capital primarily consisted of a decrease in deferred revenue of $14.1 million. The decrease in deferred revenue was a result of contracts closed during prior periods with associated upfront fees, on which we began recognizing revenue ratably as implementations were completed and software services have commenced.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $47.1 million, consisting of $45.9 million of proceeds from our initial public offering, net of issuance costs, and $32.8 million in proceeds from credit facility and term-debt borrowings partially offset by $19.6 million of debt and capital lease obligation payments, $9.0 million of dividends on preferred stock, $2.3 million of deferred business acquisition purchase price and $0.7 million of financing fees paid.\nEnterprise/State gross margin increased by $12.2 million and was driven primarily by a $18.5 million increase in Enterprise/State revenue, partially offset by a $6.3 million increase in Enterprise/State cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is primarily attributable to amortization of previously deferred implementation costs related to new customer implementations that were completed in the fourth quarter of 2013 and throughout 2014, along with $0.7 million of accelerated deferred cost amortization related to the termination of a state exchange contract in the third quarter of 2014. Our Enterprise/State gross margin included $0.1 million in depreciation and amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nAnother component of our revenue is professional services, which we primarily derive from the implementation of our customers onto our platform, typically including discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing and training. We derive the majority of our professional services revenue from the implementation of our customers onto our platform. In general, it takes from six to fifteen months to implement a new enterprise customer's insurance distribution solution and from one to three months to implement a new Medicare or Private Exchange insurance distribution solution. Professional services revenue accounted for approximately 30%, 21% and 24% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(B)(1), which will allow us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nCost of Revenue\n The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to a $1.2 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs due to hiring of additional sales employees and a $0.6 million increase in other expenses, of which $0.2 million was attributed to our 2015 Client Forum event.\nGoodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nSubordinated Loans\nRevenue\nrevenue growth and operating margins and the determination of an appropriate discount rate. Each reporting unit had greater than $1.3 million excess fair value over carrying value as of our last assessment.\nQuarterly Trends and Seasonality\nSoftware services revenue accounted for approximately 67%, 75% and 68% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nInterest on the THL Note accrues at a variable rate of LIBOR plus a LIBOR margin, and is payable monthly. As of December 31, 2015, the rate was 12.0% and the outstanding balance, net of OID, was $29.6 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities of $1.7 million consisted of a net loss of $26.4 million partially offset by $21.4 million of cash provided by changes in working capital and $6.7 million in adjustments for non-cash items. The cash provided by changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $41.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in operating cash flow due to a $11.3 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in deferred revenue was a result of contracts closed during the period with associated upfront fees, which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the customer contract period beginning once the software services have commenced. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to the growth of our revenue and fees invoiced for the period.\nFor all contractual arrangements that include multiple elements, we allocate revenue from a customer contract to software services and professional services based on the type of multiple element arrangement. For instance, with respect to multiple-element arrangements containing hosted software, we identify each software and professional services unit of accounting based on the terms of the customer contract and allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. Revenue from each element is recognized as each element is delivered. Similarly, for multiple-element arrangements containing non-hosted software, during the periods reported we accounted for the entire arrangement as a single unit of accounting, because some or all of the deliverable elements did not have stand-alone value when the related contracts were executed. In these situations, all revenue has been deferred until delivery of the final element, at which time the contract value is recognized ratably over the longer of the contract or estimated period of customer benefit. For purposes of presentation in management's discussion and analysis, management classifies a portion of the overall arrangement fee as software and professional services fees based on an evaluation of various available indicators of fair value, including relative contract value of the software and professional services elements to total contractual value, and applies judgment to reasonably classify the arrangement fee. Our classification of multiple element arrangement fees does not affect the timing or amount of revenue recognized.\n (1) Repayment of the revolving line of credit is due at end of the term in January 2018. Early repayment is allowed and the revolving line of credit and interest was repaid subsequent to year end. \nWe review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value.\nWe believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand the revenue we generate from them over time is an important component of our growth strategy and reflects the long-term value of our customer relationships. We measure our performance on this basis using a metric we refer to as our Software Revenue Retention Rate. We calculate this metric for a particular period by establishing the group of our customers that had active contracts for a given period (excluding our Enterprise/State customers, of which there were two and three customers in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively). We then calculate our Software\nWe also derive a small portion of our revenue from commissions earned on annual employee enrollments in which our health plan network and software solutions are used in connection with each enrollment.\nacquisition and integration of DRX into our business and a $0.4 million benefit from the settlement of a number of sales and use tax contingencies in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in other expenses. While we expect our general and administrative expenses will grow as our business grows, we believe such expenses as a percent of revenue will decline.\n We expect that the amount of our Contracted Backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from period to period for several reasons, including the amount of cash collected early in the contract term, the specific timing and duration of large customer contracts, varying invoicing cycles of customer contracts, potential customer upsells dependent on our customer contracts, the specific timing of customer renewal and changes in customer financial circumstances. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in our Contracted Backlog may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue beyond one year.\nWe serve four separate but related market segments: Enterprise/Commercial, Enterprise/State, Medicare and Private Exchange. Our largest market segment is the Enterprise/Commercial market, in which we sell our solutions to health plans. Our Enterprise/State segment sells our sales automation solutions to state governments, which allow our state government customers to offer customized individual and small group exchanges. Our Medicare segment sells web-based Medicare plan comparison and enrollment tools to a variety of different customers, including health plans, pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, pharmacies, field marketing organizations, or FMOs, and call centers. Lastly, our Private Exchange segment sells comprehensive defined-contribution benefit exchange solutions to benefit consultants, brokers, exchange operators and aggregators. We believe our presence in these markets and resulting access to such a broad and diverse customer base gives us a strong position at the center of the health insurance distribution marketplace.\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our outstanding debt facilities, non-cancelable leases for our office space and computer equipment, purchase commitments for our co-location and other support services. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these estimates.\nrevenue and related deferred implementation costs associated with these implementations. The transition from a period of implementing software with no revenue to a period of customer software usage and revenue recognition is a key driver of the change from the negative gross margins recorded in the Enterprise/Commercial and Enterprise/State reportable segments during the year ended December 31, 2013 to positive gross margins in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenue\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to $2.2 million of incremental costs associated with being a public company and $0.3 million related to the 2015 transition of chief executive officer responsibilities. Additionally, the 2014 comparative period includes a $1.0 million benefit recorded related to the decrease in fair value of the DestinationRx contingent acquisition consideration and a $0.4 million benefit from the settlement of a number of sales and use tax contingencies, which were both recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. While we expect our general and administrative expenses will grow as our business grows, we believe such expenses as a percent of revenue will decline.\n We believe that cash from operations, the proceeds from our offering, cash on hand and available capacity under our Credit Facility will provide liquidity to meet anticipated future short term capital requirements for the next twelve months. The sufficiency of these liquidity sources to fund necessary and committed capital needs will be dependent upon our ability to meet our covenant requirements of our Credit Facility. See the section titled \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources-Senior Credit Facility\u201d for a description of our Credit Facility.\nFor all arrangements that include multiple elements, the allocation of revenue from a customer contract to software services and professional services is based on the type of multiple-element arrangement. For multiple-element arrangements containing hosted software, we identify each software and professional services unit of accounting based on the terms of the customer contract and allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. Revenue from each element is recognized as each element is delivered. For multiple-element arrangements containing non-hosted software, during the periods reported we accounted for the entire arrangement as a single unit of accounting, because some or all of the deliverable elements did not have stand-alone value when the related contracts were executed. In these situations, all revenue has been deferred until delivery of the final element, at which time the contract value is recognized ratably over the longer of the contract or estimated period of customer benefit. Less than 30% of our consolidated revenues in each of the periods ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 had multiple-element arrangements containing non-hosted software.\nProfessional services revenue accounted for approximately 30%, 21% and 24% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n The growth in software services revenue was primarily attributable to the year-over-year growth in customers implemented on our software solutions, offset by a $4.6 million year-over-year reduction in software services resulting from the completion of contractual relationships with two state exchange customers. The increase in professional services revenue was primarily attributable to the satisfaction of several Enterprise/Commercial customer obligations, along with the accelerated recognition of $3.6 million of revenue from the second quarter 2015 termination of our contractual relationships with two Enterprise/Commercial customers, offset by a $3.7 million year-over-year decline related to the previously mentioned state exchange customers.\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Components of Operating Results.\u201d In addition, we utilize other key metrics as described below.\nOther expenses primarily consists of interest expense incurred on outstanding borrowings under our financing obligations, existing notes and credit facilities.\nJOBS Act\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had standby letters of credit totaling $0.2 million as security for rented office space.\nInterest Expense\nStatements of Operations Data\nOverview\nThe Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Company, as well as various limitations on the activities of the Company as they relate to additional indebtedness, junior liens, investments, capital expenditures, and mergers and acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we amended the Credit Facility to establish the 2015 and 2016 financial covenants, including a quarterly building EBITDA covenant and a minimum liquidity covenant. The quarterly building EBITDA covenant sets forth\nOur Enterprise/State software service and professional services fees are largely derived from multiple element contracts for non-hosted software solutions and related services for which we do not have vendor\nCost of revenue primarily consists of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, for employees providing services to our customers and supporting our Enterprise or SaaS platform infrastructures. Additional expenses in cost of revenue include co-location facility costs for our data centers, depreciation expense for computer equipment directly associated with generating revenue, infrastructure maintenance costs, amortization expenses associated with deferred implementation costs and acquired intangible assets, allocated overhead and other direct costs.\n (1) Cost of revenue and operating expenses include stock-based compensation expense as follows: \nMedicare gross margin increased by $1.6 million and was driven primarily by a $0.2 million increase in Medicare revenue and $1.4 million decrease in Medicare cost of revenue. The decrease in cost of revenue is primarily attributable to a decrease in personnel costs. Our Medicare gross margin included $2.5 million and $2.4 million in depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level using a two-step approach. In step one, we determine if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the unit's carrying value. If step one indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform step two, determining the fair value of goodwill and, if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, recording an impairment charge.\nmeeting, and is expected to occur at the end of April 2016. If the closing has not occurred on or before June 30, 2016, the Investment Agreement may be terminated by us or the Investors. In addition, the agreement may be terminated by mutual written agreement or upon uncured material breach. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to the financing.\nGeneral and Administrative\n (2) Includes estimated interest payments based on contractual rates as of December 31, 2015.  Recent Development\nIn the future, we may seek to access the capital markets to raise additional equity financing for various business reasons, including required debt payments and acquisitions. The timing, term, size, and pricing of any such financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing. In addition, if we are unable to comply with our debt covenants in the future and as a result default on our loan agreements, approximately $49.4 million of our outstanding borrowings would become immediately payable, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\ndetermination of whether the contract meets the definition of software and the corresponding separability of the elements and fair value assessments require judgment.\nOperating Expenses\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe have multiple sources of revenue, which fall under different sets of revenue recognition rules including accounting for revenue under hosted and non-hosted arrangements and percentage of completion accounting. The\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation for administrative, finance and accounting, legal, information technology and human resource employees. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, insurance and other corporate expenses, and travel. Our general and administrative expenses have, and we expect that they will continue to, increase as a result of operating as a public company and include costs associated with compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations governing public companies, increased costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance, increased professional services expenses and costs associated with an enhanced investor relations function.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash provided by financing activities was $26.2 million, consisting of $39.9 million in proceeds from credit facility and term-debt borrowings, partially offset by $12.3 million of repayments of debt and capital lease obligations and $1.2 million of financing fees paid.\n Operating Activities\nWe recognize revenue for upfront license and implementation fees over the longer of the term of the customer agreement or the estimated period of customer benefit based on various factors including, but not limited to, contract terms, contract extensions and renewals, customer attrition, the nature and pace of technology advancements and obsolescence, and the anticipated impact of demand, competition, and other regulatory and economic factors.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWhile we expect to continue our research and development investment in new software solutions and functionality, we believe such expense will decline over time to our long-term target of under twenty percent of revenue.\nSales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and commissions for our sales and marketing employees. We record expense for commissions at the time of contract signing. Additional expenses include advertising, lead generation, promotional event programs, corporate communications, travel and allocated overhead. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in both dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the foreseeable future as we further increase the number of our sales and marketing employees and expand our marketing activities in order to continue to grow our business.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe derive our revenue primarily from the following sources: (a) the sale, implementation and ongoing support of our insurance distribution solutions; (b) fees from brokers for the right to access our multi-payer quoting platform; (c) our Medicare.gov contract, which was a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract through the fourth quarter of 2015; and (d) commissions earned on annual employee enrollments in which our health plan network and software solutions are used in connection with each enrollment. In all contractual arrangements, we determine whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. If any of these criteria are not met, the Company does not recognize revenue until all of the criteria are met.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, and the availability on our revolving line of credit on our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months, including expected capital expenditure requirements of approximately $1.0 million to $2.0 million. If our available cash and cash equivalents balances are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities or enter into an additional credit facility. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities, these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. We may require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe negative gross margins recorded in the Enterprise/Commercial and Enterprise/State reportable segments during the year ended December 31, 2013 were primarily caused by the amount of indirect labor and overhead in cost of revenue that indirectly support future revenue, but which may not be deferred and capitalized to \u201cdeferred implementation costs\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet. Specifically, in both reportable segments, the Company experienced a significant level of new customer implementation activity (more than 30 software implementations during the period reported). The Company deferred the corresponding implementation services revenue and direct costs associated with those implementations, but expensed the associated indirect labor and overhead in cost of revenue. As the Enterprise/Commercial and Enterprise/State software implementations were completed during the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, the Company started amortizing the deferred\nResearch and Development\nAnother component of our revenue is professional services, which we primarily derive from the implementation of our customers onto our platform, typically including discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing and training. In general, it takes from six to fifteen months to implement a new Enterprise/Commercial or Enterprise/State customer's insurance distribution solution and from one to four months to implement a new Medicare or Private Exchange insurance distribution solution.\nWe have three reporting units with goodwill, Enterprise/Commercial, Medicare, and Private Exchange; the Enterprise/Commercial, Medicare, and Private Exchange reporting units have $7.7 million, $14.7 million, and $4.3 million of goodwill, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use a discounted cash flow analysis which requires significant assumptions and estimates about future operations. Significant judgments inherent in this discounted cash flow analysis include the expected\nOur cash flows were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nIncome taxes primarily consist of United States federal and state income tax net operating loss benefits, net of changes in valuation allowances. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.\nOther Expenses\nThe increased research and development spending has resulted in expanded product capabilities with our Private Exchange software solution, which has translated into new customer contracts and revenue opportunities, and productivity enhancements via reduced implementation cycle times in our Enterprise/Commercial software solutions, which we anticipate will lead to lower implementation costs in future periods. The increased expenditures have also resulted in expanded product capabilities within our Enterprise/State solution that allow us to pursue sales opportunities in new markets and improve Medicare shopping, enrollment and member engagement software capabilities, which we expect will lead to incremental sales in future periods.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated:\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $5.3 million for 2015, consisting of $4.8 million in repayments of debt and capital lease obligations, $0.7 million in payments of offering costs related to our December 2014 IPO, offset by $0.3 million in net proceeds from employee stock option transactions.\nOur overall operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are out of our control. These fluctuations are primarily driven by an increase in the third and fourth quarters in activity at our customers in preparation for and during the annual insurance enrollment cycle, which occurs annually during our fourth quarter. Our historical results should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future results of operations.\nCost of Revenue\nWe believe the balance of contracted future billings, or Contracted Backlog, is an important indicator of the economic health of our business, as it provides an important source of visibility into our future sources of revenue.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we amended the THL Note to establish 2015 and 2016 financial covenants, including a quarterly building EBITDA covenant and a minimum liquidity covenant. The quarterly building EBITDA covenant sets forth specific levels of cumulative trailing twelve month EBITDA measured on calendar quarter ends. The quarterly building EBITDA covenant increases from $2.6 million for the measurement period ending March 31, 2015 to $7.7 million for the year ending December 31, 2015, and ranges from $5.3 million to $8.6 million for the year ending December 31, 2016. The minimum liquidity covenant requires us to maintain a minimum liquidity level of $6.8 million as of December 31, 2015, $4.5 million until June 30, 2016, $6.8 million until September 30, 2016, and $9.0 million subsequent to that. Minimum liquidity is defined as the sum of cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity available to us under the $10.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility. The minimum liquidity covenant expires once we achieve a Fixed Coverage Ratio in excess of 1.25:1.00 for two consecutive quarters. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with our financial covenants, and we expect to be in compliance with the 2016 financial covenants.\nWe fund our operations primarily through cash from operating activities and bank and subordinated debt borrowings. As of December 31, 2015, we have cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 million which is held for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to develop new technologies, fund capital expenditures, make investments in or acquisitions of other businesses, solutions or technologies or repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our policy is to invest any cash in excess of our immediate requirements in investments designed to preserve the principal balance and provide liquidity. Accordingly, our cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in demand deposit and money market accounts that are currently providing only a minimal return.\n The increase in sales and marketing expense in dollars was primarily attributable to a $0.8 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, due to sales employees hired in 2014 to continue driving revenue growth.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our net cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities of $16.2 million consisted of a net loss of $7.3 million and $19.4 million of cash used by changes in working capital, offset by $10.6 million in adjustments for non-cash items. The decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of a decrease in deferred revenue of $21.2 million. The decrease in deferred revenue was a result of recognizing previously deferred upfront fees which are recognized as revenue ratably\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $1.3 million, for the purchase of property and equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $0.8 million, for the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $27.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. We spent $25.9 million on the acquisition of DRX, net of cash acquired. In addition, we spent $1.2 million to purchase property and equipment.\nDeferred Implementation Costs\nSources of Liquidity\nOverhead Allocation\nAs a result of cumulative net operating losses, we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $87.9 million as of December 31, 2015. State net operating loss carryforwards were approximately $56.5 million as of December 31, 2015. Our net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in 2020, if not utilized. As a result of prior equity issuances and other transactions in our stock, we have previously experienced \u201cownership changes\u201d under Section 382 which limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards available to us. We may also experience ownership changes in the future, which may result in further limitation of the amount of net operating losses which may be available in future years. At December 31, 2015 we had a full tax valuation allowance offsetting the recorded tax benefit of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards.\nOur cost of revenue is expensed as we incur the costs, with the exception of certain direct, incremental costs associated with new customer implementation efforts, which we defer. The related revenue from fees we receive for our implementation services performed before a customer is operating on our platform is deferred until the commencement of the monthly subscription and recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the related contract term or the estimated period of customer benefit. Therefore, certain costs incurred in providing these services can be expensed in periods prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Our cost associated with providing implementation services has been significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost associated with providing our monthly subscription services due to the labor associated with providing implementation services.\nFinancing Activities", "item_7_text": "specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of relative fair value of the contractual elements. In addition, we derive ongoing production support revenues from separately contracted arrangements for which we do have VSOE. For purposes of presentation in management's discussion and analysis, management classifies a portion of the overall arrangement fee as software services and professional services based on an evaluation of various available indicators of fair value, including relative contract value of the software and professional services elements to total contractual value, and applies judgment to reasonably classify the arrangement fee. Our classification of multiple element arrangement fees is for management's discussion and analysis purposes only and does not affect the timing or amount of revenue recognized.\nThe amount of Enterprise/State revenue classified as perpetual software licenses within our software services revenue is less than 10% of consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nMost of our deferred revenue relates to professional services performed for our Enterprise/Commercial and Enterprise/State customers, which require a more extensive and lengthy implementation. We expect to continue to evaluate the term over which our Enterprise/Commercial implementation fee revenue is recognized as we gain more experience with customer contract renewals.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing in Part II, Item 8: \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nWe are a leading web-based consumer shopping, enrollment and retention platform for health insurance distribution. Our solutions support the industry evolution towards a consumer-centric experience that is transforming how health insurance is purchased and distributed. Our solutions offer personalized health insurance shopping experience that recommends the best fit insurance plan based on an individual's preferences, health status, preferred providers, medications and expected out-of-pocket costs. Our customers are health insurance marketplace operators, such as health plans, brokers, and exchange operators that must distribute health insurance in a cost-effective manner to a growing number of insured consumers. Our solutions automate key functions in the health insurance distribution process, allowing our customers to price and present plan options accurately to consumers and efficiently enroll, renew and manage plan members.\n The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a $3.4 million decrease in professional fees to outside contractors, a $0.9 million decrease in salaries and personnel-related costs and a $1.8 million decrease in other costs primarily related to a decrease in outside call center, travel and facilities costs. Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2015 we amortized an additional $5.4 million of previously deferred implementation costs, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, of which $2.6 million was accelerated amortization related to the two above-mentioned second quarter 2015 Enterprise/Commercial customer terminations. We also experienced a $1.0 million increase in capitalization of new customer deferred implementation costs compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\n Growth in software services revenue was primarily attributable to the recognition of full years' worth of software service revenues related to customer implementations completed in fourth quarter of 2013, with majority of the growth from our Enterprise/State segment. Our professional services revenue increased due to revenue recognition from newly completed implementations.\nOn March 11, 2016, we entered into an Investment Agreement with certain accredited investors, or the Investors, including funds affiliated with one of our directors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue an aggregate of 52,000 shares of our newly-authorized Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at a price per share of $1,000.00, in a private placement transaction, or the Private Placement, in reliance on the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act, and Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. The closing of the offering is subject to customary closing conditions and approval of our stockholders at our annual\nA substantial amount of revenue in a period comes from the recognition of previously collected and deferred revenue, while period-end accounts receivable balances are directly influenced by the timing of contractually negotiated milestone and time-based advance billings and their subsequent collection. We generally have the contractual right to invoice and collect fees from customers ahead of delivery and revenue recognition of our software and professional services.\nWe derive most of our revenue from software services fees, which primarily consist of monthly subscription fees paid to us for access to, usage and hosting of our web-based insurance distribution software solutions, and related production support services.\nOn January 15, 2013, we entered into a bank credit facility to provide for short-term working capital and long-term investment needs, or the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility initially provided for $22.5 million of term loans, or Senior Term Loans, and $5.0 million of revolving credit, or the Senior Revolving Credit Facility, through January 15, 2018, or the Maturity Date. The Senior Term Loans require quarterly principal payments of $0.3 million commencing on March 31, 2013, with the unpaid principal balance payable in full on the Maturity Date. On March 12, 2014, we amended the Credit Facility to, among other things, increase the Senior Revolving Credit Facility by $5.0 million to $10.0 million.\n\n The decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a $1.0 million benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the decrease in fair value of the DestinationRx contingent acquisition consideration, a $0.7 million decrease in consulting and professional fees directly related to the 2013\nThe statements included herein that are not based solely on historical facts are \u201cforward looking statements.\u201d Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by us in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly under the section titled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\n (2) We define adjusted gross margin as gross margin before depreciation and amortization expense, as well as stock-based compensation expense. See the section titled \u201cAdjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA\u201d below for more information and for a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to gross margin, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. \nThe Enterprise/State segment had one remaining state exchange customer at December 31, 2015, compared to three in the comparative year. As a result of the customer decline we anticipate future Enterprise/State revenue will be lower than prior periods.\nSegment Revenue\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our Software Revenue Retention Rate was in excess of 92%.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 31, or more frequently if events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nWe have generally signed multiple-year subscription contracts for our software services. The timing of our invoices to our customer is a negotiated term and thus varies among our software contracts. For multiple-year agreements, it is common to invoice an initial amount at contract signing for implementation work that is deferred, followed by subsequent annual, quarterly or monthly invoices once we launch a customer, which is when our product is usable by the customer. At any point in the contract term, there may be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements and are considered by us to be Contracted Backlog. The amount of our total Contracted Backlog for software services and professional services contracts, which we define as including both cancellable and non-cancellable portions of our customer agreements that we have not yet billed, was approximately $89.7 million and $78.2 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We fulfill Contracted Backlog associated with a customer contract when the customer implementation process is complete. Our implementation timelines can vary between one and 15 months based on the type of solution, source and condition of the data we receive from third parties, the configurations that we agree to provide and the size of the customer. As a result, our implementation timelines are subject to significant uncertainties, which can have a material impact on our total Contracted Backlog and Contracted Backlog that we fulfill in the current year. Based on our current implementation forecasts, we expect to fulfill our total Contracted Backlog as of December 31, 2015 over a period of approximately four years.\nExpenses associated with our facilities and depreciation are allocated between cost of revenue and operating expenses based on employee payroll costs determined by the nature of work performed.\nAt December 31, 2015, deferred revenue related to the Enterprise/Commercial segment was $39.1 million and is being recognized in our statements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately three years. If the weighted average period had been increased by one year to four years, the Enterprise/Commercial revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 would have decreased by approximately $5.0 million.\nWe also derive a small portion of other revenue from commissions earned on annual employee enrollments in which our health plan network and software solutions are used in connection with each enrollment.\n \u2022 the date on which it is deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d which will occur at such time as the company (a) has an aggregate worldwide market value of common equity securities held by non-affiliates of $700 million or more as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (b) has been required to file annual and quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for a period of at least 12 months and (c) has filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Securities Act of 1934.  Under this definition, we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and could remain an emerging growth company until as late as December 31, 2019.\nover the longer of the estimated period of customer benefit or contract, beginning once the software services have commenced.\nRevenue\nOn March 18, 2013, we entered into a Senior Subordinated Term Loan Agreement with THL Corporate Finance, Inc., or the THL Note, for total proceeds of $10.0 million less $0.2 million of original issue discount, or OID, to finance the repayment of the $6.0 million subordinated promissory notes and to fund working capital needs. The THL Note maturity date is July 15, 2018, with the principal balance payable in full at the maturity date.\nCost of Revenue\nSoftware services fees paid to us from our Enterprise/Commercial customers are contracted rates based on the size of the health plan using our solutions for a specified period of time, which usually ranges from three to five years, and the number of software modules used. Software services fees paid to us from our Enterprise/State customers are contracted rates based on the number of software solutions modules being used for a specified period of time, which usually ranges from one to three years. Software services fees paid to us from our Medicare and Private Exchange customers are based on the volume of enrollments for which our software solutions are utilized for a contracted period, which usually ranges from one to three years. Our customer contracts are generally only cancellable by the customer in an instance of our uncured breach, although some of our customers are able to terminate their respective contracts without cause or for convenience. Software services revenue accounted for approximately 67%, 75% and 68% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nResearch and Development\nThe increased research and development spending during the year ended December 31, 2015, was a continuation of our efforts to invest in a common software platform intended to reduce future software implementation and maintenance costs and increase margins. We expect these efforts will benefit our Enterprise Commercial and Private Exchange segments. Additionally, we continued development of new software solutions intended to take advantage of opportunities within our customer base and the emerging private exchange market.\nSegment Revenue\n \u2022 the last day of its fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of its initial public offering of common equity securities; \nspecific levels of cumulative trailing twelve month EBITDA measured on calendar quarter ends. The quarterly building EBITDA covenant increases from $3.5 million for the measurement period ending March 31, 2015 to $8.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2015, and ranges from $5.9 million to $9.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2016. The minimum liquidity covenant requires us to maintain a minimum liquidity level of $7.5 million as of December 31, 2015, $5.0 million until June 30, 2016, and $7.5 million subsequent to that. Minimum liquidity is defined as the sum of cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity available to us under the $10.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility. The minimum liquidity covenant expires once we achieve a Fixed Coverage Ratio, as defined, in excess of 1.25:1.00 for two consecutive quarters. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with financial covenants, and we expect to be in compliance with the 2016 financial covenants.\nThe Medicare gross margin increase consisted of a $1.8 million increase in revenue and $0.6 million increase in cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to personnel-related cost increases to support current and anticipated growth in this segment. Our Medicare gross margin included $2.5 million of depreciation and amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nResearch and development expense. The nature of our research and development activities includes market requirements and definition, product design, software development, quality assurance and product release. Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation for our research and development employees. Additional expenses include costs related to the development, quality assurance, and testing of new technology, and enhancement of our existing platform technology, consulting, travel and allocated overhead. We believe continuing to invest in research and development efforts is essential to maintaining our competitive position. We expect our research and development expense to increase in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the near term, but decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term as we achieve economies of scale.\nComponents of Operating Results\nResults of Operations\n The Enterprise/Commercial gross margin increase consisted of a $15.1 million increase in revenue and $1.7 million increase in cost of revenue. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to recognition of previously deferred revenue related to software implementations and ancillary professional services upon the satisfaction of remaining contractual obligations and $3.6 million second quarter 2015 accelerated recognition of revenue from the termination of our contractual relationship with two Enterprise/Commercial customers. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a $6.9 million increase in the recognition of previously deferred costs related to software implementations, which is inclusive of $2.6 million of accelerated amortization related to the second quarter 2015 termination of our contractual relationship with the two Enterprise/Commercial customers, partially offset by a $4.5 million reduction in direct labor, outside contractor costs, and related travel following the completion of our efforts related to the October 1, 2013 ACA rollout and a $0.7 million reduction in deferred implementation cost capitalization and other expenses compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our Enterprise/Commercial gross margin included $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of depreciation and amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nIn December 2014, we completed an initial public offering in which we issued and sold 6,635,000 shares of our common stock and existing shareholders sold 995,250 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.00 per share. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the existing shareholders. We received net proceeds of $45.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other direct offering expenses, which were available for general corporate purposes. Prior to our initial public offering, we funded our operations primarily through cash from operating activities, bank and subordinated debt borrowings and the private issuance of equity securities.\nOur Segments\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on new accounting standards.\n \u2022 the last day of its fiscal year in which it has annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more; \nAdjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA\nAt December 31, 2015, deferred revenue related to the single Enterprise/State customer was approximately $4.5 million and is being recognized in our statement of operations over a remaining period of approximately 1.5 years.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nInterest Expense\n The dollar increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a $6.2 million decrease in capitalization of deferred implementation costs related to new customer implementations and a $4.6 million increase in amortization of previously deferred implementation costs, partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in salaries and personnel-related costs associated with 2014 staffing realignments, a $4.6 million decrease in professional fees to outside contractors utilized to support customer implementation services and a decrease of approximately $1.6 million primarily related to reduced travel expenses to customer sites and hosting expenses to support our platforms.\nThe anticipated impact of the December 31, 2015 Contracted Backlog on each future year is as follows:\nKey Financial and Operating Performance Metrics\n The increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to a $4.2 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, due to additional research and development headcount. Additionally, we experienced a $1.1 million increase in engineering consulting fees for assistance in product development and $1.0 million related primarily to increases in facilities and travel costs driven by an increase in headcount.\n\nSegment Gross Margin\nThe following table sets forth segment results for revenue and gross margin for the periods indicated:\nAdjusted gross margin represents our gross margin before depreciation and amortization expense, as well as stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, represents net income (loss) before net interest, other expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation and non-cash changes in fair value of contingent consideration and impairments of goodwill, intangible, and other long-lived assets, if any. Adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please refer to \u201cSelected Consolidated Financial Data-Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the limitations of adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBITDA and reconciliations of adjusted gross margin to gross margin and adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable GAAP measurements, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nThe JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As defined in the JOBS Act, a public company whose initial public offering of common equity securities occurred after December 8, 2011 and whose annual gross revenue is less than $1.0 billion will, in general, qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of:\nThe Private Exchange gross margin increase consisted of a $2.6 million increase in revenue and $0.6 million decrease in cost of revenue. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a $1.3 million one-time gain on extinguishment of a vendor obligation offset by a $0.7 million increase in personnel-related and other costs to support current and anticipated customer growth in this segment. Our Private Exchange gross margin included $0.9 million and $0.8 million of depreciation and amortization in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nContracted Backlog\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSales and Marketing\nManagement is focused on risks that could have an adverse impact on our operations and our key financial and operating performance metrics, as described below, and takes actions to mitigate those risks. In our Enterprise/Commercial segment, for example, while fluctuations in bookings are not uncommon given the sales cycle for product and services in that segment, management routinely assesses staffing levels required to support contracted business volume and adjusts staffing levels accordingly. As part of its ongoing assessment of our software capabilities, management also considers industry trends, such as consumers' increased reliance on mobile devices, to determine where to allocate research and development funding. One of our overall strategic initiatives is to continue to increase the percentage of software services revenue (and reduce professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue) as we believe this will have a positive impact on overall gross margins in the future.\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe Senior Term Loans accrue interest at a rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a LIBOR margin payable monthly. The Senior Revolving Credit Facility accrues interest monthly at a rate based on LIBOR, the Fed Funds Rate or bank's Prime Rate. As of December 31, 2015, the interest rates on the outstanding Senior Term Loans and Senior Revolving Credit Facility advances were 5.9% to 8.0%.\n The increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to a $3.5 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, due to additional research and development efforts. Additionally, we experienced a $1.1 million increase in engineering consulting fees and other expenses for product development.\nWe sell our web-based solutions and related services primarily through our direct sales force. We derive most of our revenue from software services fees, which primarily consist of monthly subscription fees paid to us for access to, usage and hosting of our web-based insurance distribution software solutions, and related production support services. Software services fees paid to us from our Enterprise/Commercial customers are based on the size of the health plan for a specified period of time, which usually ranges from three to five years, and the number of software modules used. Software services fees paid to our Enterprise/State segment are based on the number of software solutions modules contracted to be used, for a specified period of time, which usually ranges from one to three years. Software services fees paid to us from our Medicare and Private Exchange customers are based on the volume of enrollments for which our software solutions are utilized for a contracted period, which usually ranges from one to three years.\nSoftware Revenue Retention Rate\nIn the first half of 2014, we amended the THL Note to, among other things, provide $20.0 million of additional subordinated term note financing through July 2018. The $20.0 million additional financing was reduced by approximately $0.5 million of original issue discount.\n\n The growth in our Enterprise/Commercial revenue was primarily attributable to an $8.5 million increase in our software services revenue driven by an increase in the number of health plan customers using our platform as of December 31, 2014, as compared to December 31, 2013, offset by a $1.1 million decrease in professional services revenue. The growth in our Enterprise/State revenue was primarily attributable to an increase of $9.4 million in software services revenue, and a $4.2 million increase in professional services revenue, driven primarily by revenue recognized from new customer implementations completed in the fourth quarter of 2013, along with $4.9 million of accelerated revenue recognition related to a termination of a state exchange contract in the third quarter of 2014. The growth in our Medicare and Private Exchange revenue was primarily attributable to a $2.8 million increase in software services revenue driven by an increase in the number of health plan and broker customers using our platform as of December 31, 2014 as compared to December 31, 2013, offset by a $1.5 million decrease in professional services revenue and $0.8 million in other revenue.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we have chosen to rely on such exemptions and are therefore not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor's attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis).\nOperating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Salaries and personnel-related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories. We expect to continue to hire new employees in these areas in order to support our anticipated revenue growth. As a result, we expect our operating expenses to increase in both aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the near term, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term as we achieve economies of scale.\nThe Enterprise/State gross margin decrease consisted of a $8.3 million decrease in revenue and a corresponding $3.5 million decrease in cost of revenue. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to the third quarter 2014 termination of a state exchange contract and the third quarter 2015 non-renewal of a state exchange customer, resulting in a reduction of subsequent software and professional services revenue. The reduction in costs of revenue relate to staffing realignment efforts consistent with current and expected future needs of our Enterprise/State segment. Our Enterprise/State gross margin included less than $0.1 million of depreciation and amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOur customer contracts are generally only cancellable by the customer in an instance of our uncured breach, although some of our customers (including government customers) are able to terminate their respective contracts without cause or for convenience. Of our top 20 customers by 2015 revenue, some customers can terminate their contract for convenience upon written notice of between 30 and 60 days. These customers represented $20.2 million, or 22.5% of our Contracted Backlog balance as of December 31, 2015.\nPrivate Exchange gross margin decreased by $0.8 million and was driven by a $1.1 million increase in Private Exchange cost of revenue, offset by a $0.2 million increase in Private Exchange revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in personnel costs to support new customer implementation efforts. Our Private Exchange gross margin included $0.8 million in depreciation and amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and project our future performance. These metrics help us develop and refine our growth strategies and make strategic decisions. We discuss consolidated revenue, gross margin and the components of operating loss, as well as segment revenue and components of segment gross margin, in \u201cManagement's Discussion and\nWe capitalize certain direct, incremental costs associated with new customer implementation efforts, and we account for those costs as deferred implementation costs, to the extent that they are deemed recoverable. We had $24.6 million of deferred implementation costs recorded as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Deferred implementation costs are amortized consistent with the recognition of deferred revenue. The deferred implementation cost balance is subject to periodic impairment evaluation to determine recoverability of the asset. At every reporting period, we evaluate the recoverability of the deferred implementation costs, factoring in the remaining implementation schedule, estimated cost to complete the implementation effort and the probability of revenue in excess of deferred costs capitalized.\nInvesting Activities\nOn January 15, 2013, we entered into a subordinated promissory note with the sellers of DRX, or the DRX Seller Note. The DRX Seller Note accrued interest at a rate of 8.0% payable upon the January 15, 2015 maturity date. In 2015, the Company repaid the DRX Seller Note and accrued interest.\nCash Flows\n The increase in interest expense in dollars was primarily attributable to an increase in average borrowings outstanding and a higher weighted average cost of debt on our outstanding borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nWe generally invoice our customers for software services in advance, in monthly, quarterly or annual installments. We typically invoice our Medicare and Private Exchange customers for implementation fees at the inception of the arrangement. We generally invoice our Enterprise/Commercial and Enterprise/State customers for implementation fees at various contractually defined times throughout the implementation process. Implementation fees that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue until recognized.\nSenior Credit Facility\nRevenue Retention Rate by taking the amount of software revenue we recognized for this group in the subsequent comparable period (for which we are reporting the rate) and dividing it by the software revenue we recognized for the group in the prior period.\nGiven the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial statements.\n The growth in our Enterprise/Commercial revenue was primarily attributable to the year-over-year growth in customers implemented on our software solutions, the completion of more software services with existing customers, and the accelerated recognition of $3.6 million of revenue from the second quarter 2015 termination of our contractual relationships with two customers. The decrease in our Enterprise/State revenue was primarily attributable to the third quarter 2014 termination of a state exchange contract and the third quarter 2015 non-renewal of a state exchange customer, resulting in a reduction of subsequent software and professional services revenue. The growth in our Medicare revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in software services and professional services as a result of an increase in customers. The growth in our Private Exchange revenue was primarily attributable to a $2.6 million growth in software services revenue as a result of an increase in both customers and revenue per customer.\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\nSales and Marketing\nSegment Gross Margin\n * Not meaningful  Enterprise/Commercial gross margin increased by $11.1 million and was driven primarily by a $7.3 million increase in Enterprise/Commercial revenue, and a $3.7 million decrease in Enterprise/Commercial cost of revenue. The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to recognition of previously deferred revenue on software that is implemented, which increased due to new health plan customer implementations completed in 2014 along with a full years' revenue on those implementations completed in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our Enterprise/Commercial gross margin included $0.4 million and $0.5 million of depreciation and amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative\nDividends on Preferred Stock\n (3) We defined adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest, other expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation and non-cash changes in fair value of contingent consideration and impairments of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets, if any. See the section titled \u201cAdjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA\u201d below for more information and for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to EBITDA, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue for each of the periods indicated:\nOur income tax (expense) benefit was not meaningful in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. We recorded a net income tax benefit of approximately $0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. The benefit in 2013 resulted primarily from a $1.2 million benefit realized related to the change in our estimate of the Company deferred tax assets, which, as a result of the January 2013 acquisition of DRX, we believe are more likely than not to be realized.\n \n \u2022 the date on which it has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and \nWe plan to continue to expand our capacity to support our growth, which will result in higher cost of revenue in dollars. However, we expect cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to decline and gross margins to increase primarily from the growth of the percentage of our revenue from software services and the realization of economies of scale driven by retention of our customers.\nIn connection with the completion of our initial public offering, all then outstanding Series A and B preferred stock were converted into common stock on a three-for-one basis, and $9.0 million of accrued dividends were paid in cash.\n The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in average borrowings outstanding and a lower weighted average cost of debt on our outstanding borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe following table summarizes the principal balances of our outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2015:\n Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our net cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities of $20.3 million consisted of a net loss of $10.2 million and $17.7 million of cash used by changes in working capital, partially offset by $7.6 million in adjustments for non-cash items. The cash used by changes in working capital primarily consisted of a decrease in deferred revenue of $14.1 million. The decrease in deferred revenue was a result of contracts closed during prior periods with associated upfront fees, on which we began recognizing revenue ratably as implementations were completed and software services have commenced.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $47.1 million, consisting of $45.9 million of proceeds from our initial public offering, net of issuance costs, and $32.8 million in proceeds from credit facility and term-debt borrowings partially offset by $19.6 million of debt and capital lease obligation payments, $9.0 million of dividends on preferred stock, $2.3 million of deferred business acquisition purchase price and $0.7 million of financing fees paid.\nEnterprise/State gross margin increased by $12.2 million and was driven primarily by a $18.5 million increase in Enterprise/State revenue, partially offset by a $6.3 million increase in Enterprise/State cost of revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is primarily attributable to amortization of previously deferred implementation costs related to new customer implementations that were completed in the fourth quarter of 2013 and throughout 2014, along with $0.7 million of accelerated deferred cost amortization related to the termination of a state exchange contract in the third quarter of 2014. Our Enterprise/State gross margin included $0.1 million in depreciation and amortization for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nAnother component of our revenue is professional services, which we primarily derive from the implementation of our customers onto our platform, typically including discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing and training. We derive the majority of our professional services revenue from the implementation of our customers onto our platform. In general, it takes from six to fifteen months to implement a new enterprise customer's insurance distribution solution and from one to three months to implement a new Medicare or Private Exchange insurance distribution solution. Professional services revenue accounted for approximately 30%, 21% and 24% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(B)(1), which will allow us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nCost of Revenue\n The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to a $1.2 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs due to hiring of additional sales employees and a $0.6 million increase in other expenses, of which $0.2 million was attributed to our 2015 Client Forum event.\nGoodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nSubordinated Loans\nRevenue\nrevenue growth and operating margins and the determination of an appropriate discount rate. Each reporting unit had greater than $1.3 million excess fair value over carrying value as of our last assessment.\nQuarterly Trends and Seasonality\nSoftware services revenue accounted for approximately 67%, 75% and 68% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nInterest on the THL Note accrues at a variable rate of LIBOR plus a LIBOR margin, and is payable monthly. As of December 31, 2015, the rate was 12.0% and the outstanding balance, net of OID, was $29.6 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities of $1.7 million consisted of a net loss of $26.4 million partially offset by $21.4 million of cash provided by changes in working capital and $6.7 million in adjustments for non-cash items. The cash provided by changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $41.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in operating cash flow due to a $11.3 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in deferred revenue was a result of contracts closed during the period with associated upfront fees, which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the customer contract period beginning once the software services have commenced. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to the growth of our revenue and fees invoiced for the period.\nFor all contractual arrangements that include multiple elements, we allocate revenue from a customer contract to software services and professional services based on the type of multiple element arrangement. For instance, with respect to multiple-element arrangements containing hosted software, we identify each software and professional services unit of accounting based on the terms of the customer contract and allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. Revenue from each element is recognized as each element is delivered. Similarly, for multiple-element arrangements containing non-hosted software, during the periods reported we accounted for the entire arrangement as a single unit of accounting, because some or all of the deliverable elements did not have stand-alone value when the related contracts were executed. In these situations, all revenue has been deferred until delivery of the final element, at which time the contract value is recognized ratably over the longer of the contract or estimated period of customer benefit. For purposes of presentation in management's discussion and analysis, management classifies a portion of the overall arrangement fee as software and professional services fees based on an evaluation of various available indicators of fair value, including relative contract value of the software and professional services elements to total contractual value, and applies judgment to reasonably classify the arrangement fee. Our classification of multiple element arrangement fees does not affect the timing or amount of revenue recognized.\n (1) Repayment of the revolving line of credit is due at end of the term in January 2018. Early repayment is allowed and the revolving line of credit and interest was repaid subsequent to year end. \nWe review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value.\nWe believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand the revenue we generate from them over time is an important component of our growth strategy and reflects the long-term value of our customer relationships. We measure our performance on this basis using a metric we refer to as our Software Revenue Retention Rate. We calculate this metric for a particular period by establishing the group of our customers that had active contracts for a given period (excluding our Enterprise/State customers, of which there were two and three customers in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively). We then calculate our Software\nWe also derive a small portion of our revenue from commissions earned on annual employee enrollments in which our health plan network and software solutions are used in connection with each enrollment.\nacquisition and integration of DRX into our business and a $0.4 million benefit from the settlement of a number of sales and use tax contingencies in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in other expenses. While we expect our general and administrative expenses will grow as our business grows, we believe such expenses as a percent of revenue will decline.\n We expect that the amount of our Contracted Backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from period to period for several reasons, including the amount of cash collected early in the contract term, the specific timing and duration of large customer contracts, varying invoicing cycles of customer contracts, potential customer upsells dependent on our customer contracts, the specific timing of customer renewal and changes in customer financial circumstances. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in our Contracted Backlog may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue beyond one year.\nWe serve four separate but related market segments: Enterprise/Commercial, Enterprise/State, Medicare and Private Exchange. Our largest market segment is the Enterprise/Commercial market, in which we sell our solutions to health plans. Our Enterprise/State segment sells our sales automation solutions to state governments, which allow our state government customers to offer customized individual and small group exchanges. Our Medicare segment sells web-based Medicare plan comparison and enrollment tools to a variety of different customers, including health plans, pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, pharmacies, field marketing organizations, or FMOs, and call centers. Lastly, our Private Exchange segment sells comprehensive defined-contribution benefit exchange solutions to benefit consultants, brokers, exchange operators and aggregators. We believe our presence in these markets and resulting access to such a broad and diverse customer base gives us a strong position at the center of the health insurance distribution marketplace.\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our outstanding debt facilities, non-cancelable leases for our office space and computer equipment, purchase commitments for our co-location and other support services. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these estimates.\nrevenue and related deferred implementation costs associated with these implementations. The transition from a period of implementing software with no revenue to a period of customer software usage and revenue recognition is a key driver of the change from the negative gross margins recorded in the Enterprise/Commercial and Enterprise/State reportable segments during the year ended December 31, 2013 to positive gross margins in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRevenue\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to $2.2 million of incremental costs associated with being a public company and $0.3 million related to the 2015 transition of chief executive officer responsibilities. Additionally, the 2014 comparative period includes a $1.0 million benefit recorded related to the decrease in fair value of the DestinationRx contingent acquisition consideration and a $0.4 million benefit from the settlement of a number of sales and use tax contingencies, which were both recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. While we expect our general and administrative expenses will grow as our business grows, we believe such expenses as a percent of revenue will decline.\n We believe that cash from operations, the proceeds from our offering, cash on hand and available capacity under our Credit Facility will provide liquidity to meet anticipated future short term capital requirements for the next twelve months. The sufficiency of these liquidity sources to fund necessary and committed capital needs will be dependent upon our ability to meet our covenant requirements of our Credit Facility. See the section titled \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources-Senior Credit Facility\u201d for a description of our Credit Facility.\nFor all arrangements that include multiple elements, the allocation of revenue from a customer contract to software services and professional services is based on the type of multiple-element arrangement. For multiple-element arrangements containing hosted software, we identify each software and professional services unit of accounting based on the terms of the customer contract and allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. Revenue from each element is recognized as each element is delivered. For multiple-element arrangements containing non-hosted software, during the periods reported we accounted for the entire arrangement as a single unit of accounting, because some or all of the deliverable elements did not have stand-alone value when the related contracts were executed. In these situations, all revenue has been deferred until delivery of the final element, at which time the contract value is recognized ratably over the longer of the contract or estimated period of customer benefit. Less than 30% of our consolidated revenues in each of the periods ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 had multiple-element arrangements containing non-hosted software.\nProfessional services revenue accounted for approximately 30%, 21% and 24% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n The growth in software services revenue was primarily attributable to the year-over-year growth in customers implemented on our software solutions, offset by a $4.6 million year-over-year reduction in software services resulting from the completion of contractual relationships with two state exchange customers. The increase in professional services revenue was primarily attributable to the satisfaction of several Enterprise/Commercial customer obligations, along with the accelerated recognition of $3.6 million of revenue from the second quarter 2015 termination of our contractual relationships with two Enterprise/Commercial customers, offset by a $3.7 million year-over-year decline related to the previously mentioned state exchange customers.\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Components of Operating Results.\u201d In addition, we utilize other key metrics as described below.\nOther expenses primarily consists of interest expense incurred on outstanding borrowings under our financing obligations, existing notes and credit facilities.\nJOBS Act\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had standby letters of credit totaling $0.2 million as security for rented office space.\nInterest Expense\nStatements of Operations Data\nOverview\nThe Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Company, as well as various limitations on the activities of the Company as they relate to additional indebtedness, junior liens, investments, capital expenditures, and mergers and acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we amended the Credit Facility to establish the 2015 and 2016 financial covenants, including a quarterly building EBITDA covenant and a minimum liquidity covenant. The quarterly building EBITDA covenant sets forth\nOur Enterprise/State software service and professional services fees are largely derived from multiple element contracts for non-hosted software solutions and related services for which we do not have vendor\nCost of revenue primarily consists of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, for employees providing services to our customers and supporting our Enterprise or SaaS platform infrastructures. Additional expenses in cost of revenue include co-location facility costs for our data centers, depreciation expense for computer equipment directly associated with generating revenue, infrastructure maintenance costs, amortization expenses associated with deferred implementation costs and acquired intangible assets, allocated overhead and other direct costs.\n (1) Cost of revenue and operating expenses include stock-based compensation expense as follows: \nMedicare gross margin increased by $1.6 million and was driven primarily by a $0.2 million increase in Medicare revenue and $1.4 million decrease in Medicare cost of revenue. The decrease in cost of revenue is primarily attributable to a decrease in personnel costs. Our Medicare gross margin included $2.5 million and $2.4 million in depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level using a two-step approach. In step one, we determine if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the unit's carrying value. If step one indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform step two, determining the fair value of goodwill and, if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, recording an impairment charge.\nmeeting, and is expected to occur at the end of April 2016. If the closing has not occurred on or before June 30, 2016, the Investment Agreement may be terminated by us or the Investors. In addition, the agreement may be terminated by mutual written agreement or upon uncured material breach. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to the financing.\nGeneral and Administrative\n (2) Includes estimated interest payments based on contractual rates as of December 31, 2015.  Recent Development\nIn the future, we may seek to access the capital markets to raise additional equity financing for various business reasons, including required debt payments and acquisitions. The timing, term, size, and pricing of any such financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing. In addition, if we are unable to comply with our debt covenants in the future and as a result default on our loan agreements, approximately $49.4 million of our outstanding borrowings would become immediately payable, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\ndetermination of whether the contract meets the definition of software and the corresponding separability of the elements and fair value assessments require judgment.\nOperating Expenses\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe have multiple sources of revenue, which fall under different sets of revenue recognition rules including accounting for revenue under hosted and non-hosted arrangements and percentage of completion accounting. The\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation for administrative, finance and accounting, legal, information technology and human resource employees. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, insurance and other corporate expenses, and travel. Our general and administrative expenses have, and we expect that they will continue to, increase as a result of operating as a public company and include costs associated with compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations governing public companies, increased costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance, increased professional services expenses and costs associated with an enhanced investor relations function.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash provided by financing activities was $26.2 million, consisting of $39.9 million in proceeds from credit facility and term-debt borrowings, partially offset by $12.3 million of repayments of debt and capital lease obligations and $1.2 million of financing fees paid.\n Operating Activities\nWe recognize revenue for upfront license and implementation fees over the longer of the term of the customer agreement or the estimated period of customer benefit based on various factors including, but not limited to, contract terms, contract extensions and renewals, customer attrition, the nature and pace of technology advancements and obsolescence, and the anticipated impact of demand, competition, and other regulatory and economic factors.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWhile we expect to continue our research and development investment in new software solutions and functionality, we believe such expense will decline over time to our long-term target of under twenty percent of revenue.\nSales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and commissions for our sales and marketing employees. We record expense for commissions at the time of contract signing. Additional expenses include advertising, lead generation, promotional event programs, corporate communications, travel and allocated overhead. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in both dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the foreseeable future as we further increase the number of our sales and marketing employees and expand our marketing activities in order to continue to grow our business.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe derive our revenue primarily from the following sources: (a) the sale, implementation and ongoing support of our insurance distribution solutions; (b) fees from brokers for the right to access our multi-payer quoting platform; (c) our Medicare.gov contract, which was a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract through the fourth quarter of 2015; and (d) commissions earned on annual employee enrollments in which our health plan network and software solutions are used in connection with each enrollment. In all contractual arrangements, we determine whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. If any of these criteria are not met, the Company does not recognize revenue until all of the criteria are met.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, and the availability on our revolving line of credit on our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months, including expected capital expenditure requirements of approximately $1.0 million to $2.0 million. If our available cash and cash equivalents balances are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities or enter into an additional credit facility. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities, these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. We may require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe negative gross margins recorded in the Enterprise/Commercial and Enterprise/State reportable segments during the year ended December 31, 2013 were primarily caused by the amount of indirect labor and overhead in cost of revenue that indirectly support future revenue, but which may not be deferred and capitalized to \u201cdeferred implementation costs\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet. Specifically, in both reportable segments, the Company experienced a significant level of new customer implementation activity (more than 30 software implementations during the period reported). The Company deferred the corresponding implementation services revenue and direct costs associated with those implementations, but expensed the associated indirect labor and overhead in cost of revenue. As the Enterprise/Commercial and Enterprise/State software implementations were completed during the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, the Company started amortizing the deferred\nResearch and Development\nAnother component of our revenue is professional services, which we primarily derive from the implementation of our customers onto our platform, typically including discovery, configuration and deployment, integration, testing and training. In general, it takes from six to fifteen months to implement a new Enterprise/Commercial or Enterprise/State customer's insurance distribution solution and from one to four months to implement a new Medicare or Private Exchange insurance distribution solution.\nWe have three reporting units with goodwill, Enterprise/Commercial, Medicare, and Private Exchange; the Enterprise/Commercial, Medicare, and Private Exchange reporting units have $7.7 million, $14.7 million, and $4.3 million of goodwill, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use a discounted cash flow analysis which requires significant assumptions and estimates about future operations. Significant judgments inherent in this discounted cash flow analysis include the expected\nOur cash flows were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nIncome taxes primarily consist of United States federal and state income tax net operating loss benefits, net of changes in valuation allowances. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.\nOther Expenses\nThe increased research and development spending has resulted in expanded product capabilities with our Private Exchange software solution, which has translated into new customer contracts and revenue opportunities, and productivity enhancements via reduced implementation cycle times in our Enterprise/Commercial software solutions, which we anticipate will lead to lower implementation costs in future periods. The increased expenditures have also resulted in expanded product capabilities within our Enterprise/State solution that allow us to pursue sales opportunities in new markets and improve Medicare shopping, enrollment and member engagement software capabilities, which we expect will lead to incremental sales in future periods.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated:\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $5.3 million for 2015, consisting of $4.8 million in repayments of debt and capital lease obligations, $0.7 million in payments of offering costs related to our December 2014 IPO, offset by $0.3 million in net proceeds from employee stock option transactions.\nOur overall operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are out of our control. These fluctuations are primarily driven by an increase in the third and fourth quarters in activity at our customers in preparation for and during the annual insurance enrollment cycle, which occurs annually during our fourth quarter. Our historical results should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future results of operations.\nCost of Revenue\nWe believe the balance of contracted future billings, or Contracted Backlog, is an important indicator of the economic health of our business, as it provides an important source of visibility into our future sources of revenue.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we amended the THL Note to establish 2015 and 2016 financial covenants, including a quarterly building EBITDA covenant and a minimum liquidity covenant. The quarterly building EBITDA covenant sets forth specific levels of cumulative trailing twelve month EBITDA measured on calendar quarter ends. The quarterly building EBITDA covenant increases from $2.6 million for the measurement period ending March 31, 2015 to $7.7 million for the year ending December 31, 2015, and ranges from $5.3 million to $8.6 million for the year ending December 31, 2016. The minimum liquidity covenant requires us to maintain a minimum liquidity level of $6.8 million as of December 31, 2015, $4.5 million until June 30, 2016, $6.8 million until September 30, 2016, and $9.0 million subsequent to that. Minimum liquidity is defined as the sum of cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity available to us under the $10.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility. The minimum liquidity covenant expires once we achieve a Fixed Coverage Ratio in excess of 1.25:1.00 for two consecutive quarters. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with our financial covenants, and we expect to be in compliance with the 2016 financial covenants.\nWe fund our operations primarily through cash from operating activities and bank and subordinated debt borrowings. As of December 31, 2015, we have cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 million which is held for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to develop new technologies, fund capital expenditures, make investments in or acquisitions of other businesses, solutions or technologies or repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our policy is to invest any cash in excess of our immediate requirements in investments designed to preserve the principal balance and provide liquidity. Accordingly, our cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in demand deposit and money market accounts that are currently providing only a minimal return.\n The increase in sales and marketing expense in dollars was primarily attributable to a $0.8 million increase in salaries and personnel-related costs, due to sales employees hired in 2014 to continue driving revenue growth.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our net cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities of $16.2 million consisted of a net loss of $7.3 million and $19.4 million of cash used by changes in working capital, offset by $10.6 million in adjustments for non-cash items. The decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of a decrease in deferred revenue of $21.2 million. The decrease in deferred revenue was a result of recognizing previously deferred upfront fees which are recognized as revenue ratably\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $1.3 million, for the purchase of property and equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $0.8 million, for the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $27.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. We spent $25.9 million on the acquisition of DRX, net of cash acquired. In addition, we spent $1.2 million to purchase property and equipment.\nDeferred Implementation Costs\nSources of Liquidity\nOverhead Allocation\nAs a result of cumulative net operating losses, we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $87.9 million as of December 31, 2015. State net operating loss carryforwards were approximately $56.5 million as of December 31, 2015. Our net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in 2020, if not utilized. As a result of prior equity issuances and other transactions in our stock, we have previously experienced \u201cownership changes\u201d under Section 382 which limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards available to us. We may also experience ownership changes in the future, which may result in further limitation of the amount of net operating losses which may be available in future years. At December 31, 2015 we had a full tax valuation allowance offsetting the recorded tax benefit of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards.\nOur cost of revenue is expensed as we incur the costs, with the exception of certain direct, incremental costs associated with new customer implementation efforts, which we defer. The related revenue from fees we receive for our implementation services performed before a customer is operating on our platform is deferred until the commencement of the monthly subscription and recognized as revenue ratably over the longer of the related contract term or the estimated period of customer benefit. Therefore, certain costs incurred in providing these services can be expensed in periods prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Our cost associated with providing implementation services has been significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost associated with providing our monthly subscription services due to the labor associated with providing implementation services.\nFinancing Activities", "item_7_tables": "Table 163: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
