MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this report. This discussion contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and all of which could be affected by uncertainties and risks. Our actual results may differ materially from the results contemplated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors including, but not limited to, those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. Historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations, particularly in light of our recent acquisitions and regulatory developments discussed throughout this report. Refer to the Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 section located in the forepart in this report for a discussion regarding forward-looking statements.\nExecutive Summary\nThe Company\nWe are a diversified mortgage banking firm focused primarily on servicing and originating residential loans, including reverse loans. We service a wide array of loans across the credit spectrum for our own portfolio and for GSEs, government agencies, third-party securitization trusts and other credit owners. Through our consumer and correspondent lending channels, we originate and purchase residential loans that we predominantly sell to GSEs and government entities. In addition, we operate several other complementary businesses which include managing a portfolio of credit-challenged, non-conforming residential mortgage loans; an insurance agency serving borrowers and credit owners of our servicing portfolio; a post charge-off collection agency; and an asset management business through our SEC registered investment advisor. These supplemental businesses allow us to leverage our core servicing capabilities and consumer base to generate complementary revenue streams.\nAt December 31, 2015, we serviced 2.2 million residential loans with a total unpaid principal balance of $266.6 billion. We have been one of the 10 largest residential loan servicers in the U.S by unpaid principal balance for the past three years according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Our originations business originated $25.1 billion in mortgage loan volume in 2015, ranking it in the top 20 originators nationally by unpaid principal balance according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Our reverse mortgage business is a leading integrated franchise in the reverse mortgage sector and, according to an industry source, was the third leading issuer of HMBS in 2015.\nDuring 2015, we added to the unpaid principal balance of our third-party mortgage loan servicing portfolio: $21.3 billion relating to acquired servicing rights, $7.3 billion relating to sub-servicing contracts and $18.6 billion relating to servicing rights capitalized upon sales of mortgage loans, while also adding $2.7 billion of unpaid principal balance to our third-party reverse loan servicing portfolio. Our third-party mortgage loan and reverse loan servicing portfolio was reduced by $39.5 billion of unpaid principal balance in payoffs and sales, net of recapture activities, during 2015. Also in 2015, we originated and purchased $1.4 billion in reverse mortgage volume and issued $1.5 billion in HMBS.\nOur mortgage loan and reverse mortgage originations businesses diversify our revenue base and offer various sources for replenishing and growing the Company's servicing portfolio. During 2015, we originated and purchased $25.1 billion of mortgage loans, substantially all of which were added to our servicing portfolio upon loan sale. Of these originations, we added $17.6 billion of unpaid principal balance to our servicing portfolio through our correspondent channel. The majority of the remaining originations resulted from our retention activities associated with our existing servicing portfolio. Through our retention activities, we assist consumers in refinancing their loans, which reduces the runoff on our existing servicing portfolio.\nWe manage our Company in three reportable segments: Servicing, Originations, and Reverse Mortgage. A description of the business conducted by each of these segments is provided below:\nServicing - Our Servicing segment consists of operations that perform servicing for third-party credit owners of mortgage loans for a fee and the Company's own mortgage loan portfolio. The Servicing segment also operates complementary businesses consisting of an insurance agency serving residential loan borrowers and credit owners and a collections agency which performs collections of post charge-off deficiency balances for third parties and the Company. In addition, the Servicing segment holds the assets and mortgage-backed debt of the Residual Trusts.\nOriginations - Our Originations segment consists of operations that originate and purchase mortgage loans that are intended for sale to third parties. In 2015, the mix of mortgage loans sold by our Originations segment, based on unpaid principal balance, shifted from substantially all Fannie Mae conventional conforming loans during 2014 to approximately (i) 56% Fannie Mae conventional conforming loans, (ii) 35% Ginnie Mae loans, and (iii) 9% Freddie Mac conventional conforming loans. A substantial majority of our Ginnie Mae mortgage loan originations in 2015 were FHA-insured loans.\nReverse Mortgage - Our Reverse Mortgage segment consists of operations that purchase and originate HECMs that are securitized, but remain on the consolidated balance sheet as collateral for secured borrowings. This segment performs servicing for third-party credit owners and the Company and provides other complementary services for the reverse mortgage market, such as real estate owned property management and disposition.\nOther - Our Other non-reportable segment primarily consists of the assets and liabilities of the Non-Residual Trusts, corporate debt and our asset management business, which we operate through GTIM.\nOverview\nOur profitability is dependent on our ability to generate revenue, primarily from our servicing and originations businesses. Our Servicing segment revenue is primarily impacted by the size and mix of our capitalized servicing and sub-servicing portfolios and is generated through servicing of mortgage loans for clients and/or credit owners. Net servicing revenue and fees includes the change in fair value of servicing rights carried at fair value and the amortization of all other servicing rights. Our servicing fee income generation is influenced by the level and timing of entrance into sub-servicing contracts and purchases and sales of servicing rights. The fair value of our servicing rights is largely dependent on the size of the related portfolio, discount rates and prepayment and default speeds. Our Originations segment revenue, which is primarily gains on sales of loans, is impacted by interest rates and the volume of loans locked as well as the margins earned in our various origination channels. Gains on sales of loans include the cost of additions to the representations and warranties reserve. Our Reverse Mortgage segment is impacted by new origination reverse loan volume, draws on existing reverse loans and the fair value of reverse loans and HMBS.\nOur results of operations are also affected by expenses such as salaries and benefits, information technology, occupancy, legal and professional fees, the provision for advances, curtailment, interest expense and other operating expenses. In addition, during 2015 and 2014, our expenses were impacted by non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $207.6 million and $82.3 million, respectively. Refer to the Financial Highlights, Results of Operations and Business Segment Results sections below for further information.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our business segments and funds available from our 2013 Revolver, master repurchase agreements, mortgage loan servicing advance facilities, issuance of HMBS and excess servicing spread financing arrangements. We may generate additional liquidity through sales of MSRs, any portion thereof, or other assets.\nFinancial Highlights\n2015 Compared to 2014\nTotal revenues for 2015 were $1.3 billion, which represented a decline of $212.9 million, or 14%, as compared to 2014. The decrease in revenue reflects a $107.2 million decrease in net servicing revenue and fees, primarily driven by $128.5 million in higher fair value losses on servicing rights; $60.2 million in lower interest income on loans; $11.7 million in lower net fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations; and $8.3 million in lower net gains on sales of loans.\nWe recorded fair value losses on our servicing rights carried at fair value primarily as a result of higher discount rates used to value our servicing rights and higher realization of expected cash flows. We had lower interest income on loans primarily due to the sale of our residual interest in seven of the Residual Trusts in the second quarter of 2015. We had lower net fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations primarily due to the widening of spreads resulting from changes in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS and a lower reduction of LIBOR in 2015 as compared to 2014, offset partially by an increase in cash generated by origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs. We had lower net gains on sales of loans due primarily to a shift in volume from the higher margin retention channel to the lower margin correspondent channel, even though average interest rates were lower during 2015 as compared to 2014 and these lower rates gave rise to a higher total volume of locked loans.\nTotal expenses for 2015 were $1.7 billion, which represented an increase of $86.7 million, or 5%, as compared to 2014. We incurred $56.5 million and $82.3 million in impairment charges in the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $151.0 million in impairment charges in our Servicing reporting unit during the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result of the goodwill impairment charges in the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit, this reporting unit no longer has goodwill. In addition, we had $33.5 million in lower interest expense related to mortgage-backed debt primarily due to the aforementioned sale of our residual interest in seven of the Residual Trusts.\nWe recognized total other gains of $33.1 million in 2015, which include an $11.8 million gain recognized on the sale of an investment which was accounted for using the equity method; an $8.9 million realized gain recognized on the sale of a trading security; a $7.3 million net fair value gain relating to the Non-Residual Trusts; a $4.7 million net gain on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of Senior Notes and the voluntary prepayment on the 2013 Term Loan; a $3.1 million gain for consideration received for the contribution of Marix to WCO; and a $2.8 million loss recognized on the sale of our residual interest in seven of the Residual Trusts.\nOur cash flows used in operating activities were $48.1 million during 2015. We finished 2015 with $202.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. Cash used in operating activities decreased by $156.2 million during 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of an increase in cash related to changes in assets and liabilities, including higher collections of servicer and protective advances and an increase in accrued expenses related to uncertain tax positions, partially offset by higher settlements of payables relating to servicer and protective advances acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of servicing rights and a decrease in accrued expenses related to legal and regulatory matters. In addition, cash increased due to proceeds received from the sale of a trading security received as consideration for the sale of the excess servicing spread associated with certain servicing rights. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash related to a lower volume of loans sold in relation to originated loans.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nTotal revenues for 2014 were $1.5 billion, which represented a decline of $315.3 million, or 17%, as compared to 2013. The decrease in revenue reflects a $181.9 million decrease in net servicing revenue and fees, primarily driven by a $321.6 million decrease related to the change in fair value of servicing rights, partially offset by increased gross servicing revenue and fees of $143.0 million resulting from the growth in our servicing portfolio; a decrease of $136.8 million in net gains on sales of loans; and lower net fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations of $10.4 million. Other revenues increased $37.3 million due primarily to $36.8 million in performance fees earned by our investment management business in 2014.\nWe incurred losses on our servicing rights carried at fair value primarily as a result of a declining interest rate environment. We had lower net gains on sales of loans due primarily to a shift in volume from the higher margin consumer retention channel to the lower margin correspondent lending channel. We had lower net fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations due primarily to lower cash generated by origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs, offset partially by the tightening of spreads from changes in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS and a reduction of LIBOR.\nTotal expenses for 2014 were $1.6 billion, which represented an increase of $241.8 million, or 17%, as compared to 2013. The increase in expenses was primarily driven by the growth in our servicing portfolio coupled with an increased provision for uncollectible advances and increased costs for legal and regulatory matters outside of normal course of business, and an $82.3 million goodwill impairment charge recorded by our Reverse Mortgage reporting unit. In addition, interest expense increased $30.4 million primarily resulting from increased average corporate debt outstanding and increased servicing advance liabilities.\nOur cash flows used in operating activities were $204.3 million during 2014. We finished 2014 with $320.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our operating cash flows increased by $1.6 billion during 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of a higher volume of loans sold in relation to originated loans given the ramp up of our mortgage loan originations business in 2013. Loan originations volume was significantly larger than volume sold in 2013. In 2014, the relationship of loan production to volume sold normalized. In addition, during 2013, the growth of our servicing portfolio required the use of additional funds for servicer and protective advances of $778.0 million of cash.\nRefer to the Results of Operations and Business Segment Results sections below for further information on the changes addressed above. Also included in the Business Segment Results section is a discussion of changes in our non-GAAP financial measures. A description of our non-GAAP financial measures is included in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below.\nOur Industry and Operating Environment\nThe majority of the approximately $10.0 trillion in U.S. residential mortgage debt outstanding has historically been serviced by large money-center banks, which generally focus on conventional mortgages with low delinquency rates. This allowed for low-cost, routine payment processing and required minimal consumer interaction. Following the credit crisis, the need for high-touch\u201d specialty servicers, such as Ditech Financial, increased as loan performance declined, delinquencies rose and servicing complexities broadened.\nThe mortgage industry has seen a significant shift in the servicing landscape since the housing downturn in 2008, as specialty servicers either sub-serviced or acquired portfolios that money-center banks and others have sought to divest. While the five largest bank servicers once commanded a nearly 60% market share of the servicing sector, their share had declined to approximately 37% at December 31, 2015. Over the next several years we expect banking organizations will continue to seek to transfer servicing to specialty servicers as they focus on their core client base and shift servicing for non-core clients and credit-sensitive loans and comply with recent changes in banking organization capital rules.\nFollowing the housing downturn in 2008, national originations volume peaked in 2012 at more than $2.0 trillion, declining to approximately $1.8 trillion in 2013 and $1.3 trillion in 2014. However, the low interest rate environment in 2015 contributed to an estimated $1.7 trillion in originations in 2015. The 30-year conventional mortgage rate averaged approximately 3.85%, 4.17% and 3.98% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Conversely, in December 2015 the Federal Reserve announced its first increase in interest rates since 2006. As of February 19, 2016, our expectations based on market data are for mortgage originations to decrease approximately 10% to $1.5 trillion in 2016 as declining refinance volume more than offsets increasing home purchase volume. Based on such data, we believe refinance volumes may drop approximately 30% in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by rising interest rates, after increasing approximately 50% in 2015 compared to 2014. While the volume of originations tends to decline in a rising interest rate environment, the value of our servicing rights tend to rise as prepayments decrease.\nThe reverse mortgage sector has seen significant change in the past several years. Several of the largest reverse mortgage originators have left the industry and there have been significant changes made by the FHA and Ginnie Mae to the products offered, underwriting guidelines and servicing protocols. Loan volumes have been in decline over the last several years. According to an industry source, we believe HECM endorsements, which represent the insuring of loans by the FHA, will decrease slightly in 2016 and begin to grow in 2017 through 2022 based on forecasts of home pricing and the senior population. We believe the growth in endorsements is an indicator that reverse loan originations are expected to increase.\nRegulatory Developments\nFor a summary of the regulatory framework under which we operate and recent regulatory developments, refer to the Laws and Regulations section of Part I, Item 1. Business.\nStrategy\nCapital Efficiency\nWe are focused on using our capital efficiently. We continue to pursue three main strategies to bolster our servicing portfolio. First, we use our originations platform to refinance and retain loans in our current servicing portfolio as well as to generate new loans to add to our servicing portfolio. Second, we are planning to increase over time the portion of our servicing portfolio that is associated with sub-servicing contracts, which generate fee income for us with lower capital outlay, as compared to purchasing servicing rights. We expect certain banks and other owners of mortgage servicing rights (including potentially WCO) will seek to engage sub-servicers to assist with certain servicing portfolios, including portfolios of credit-sensitive and defaulted loans. We believe we are well-positioned to compete for such sub-servicing engagements, given the scale and track record of our servicing platform. Third, we may also, from time to time, consider acquiring mortgage servicing rights.\nAlthough we remain committed to expanding our servicing portfolio, we expect that over time we will seek to limit our investment in mortgage servicing rights. We plan to seek to sell mortgage servicing rights owned by us to WCO or to other third parties, generally on the basis that we are retained by the buyer to sub-service such rights. We may also seek to sell excess servicing spread or other similar assets. Our strategy for growing our servicing portfolio generally depends on being able to collaborate with owners of servicing rights in this manner. Our ability to effect such collaborations will depend on various factors such as the capital available to such parties, their ability to purchase servicing rights at a price attractive to them and agreement between us and them on the price and terms for our sub-servicing engagement.\nIn 2015, in connection with our focus on efficient use of capital, we monetized certain non-core assets. In April 2015, we sold the residual interests in seven of the Residual Trusts and in the first quarter of 2015 we sold an equity method investment, as described in Business Segment Results. Further, we continue to work on a potential sale of substantially all of our insurance business. There can be no assurance this potential sale will be consummated. We may consider other asset sale opportunities if they arise.\nDuring 2015, we undertook a number of actions designed to strengthen the capital structure of the Company. These actions included the repurchase of approximately 2.4 million shares of common stock under our publicly announced repurchase authorization, the repurchase of Senior Notes with a carrying value of $35.7 million and a voluntary payment of $50.0 million on the 2013 Term Loan. We intend to pursue opportunities designed to further strengthen the Company's capital structure through the efficient deployment of capital generated from contemplated future actions including the aforementioned potential sale of the insurance business, potential sales of mortgage servicing rights or excess servicing spread or other similar assets, as well as cash generated from our operations.\nFrom time to time, we may look to selectively grow and add to our complementary businesses which leverage our core servicing portfolio and platform.\nConsumer-Focused Rebranding\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we consolidated Ditech Mortgage Corp and Green Tree Servicing into one legal entity, Ditech Financial, with one brand, Ditech, a Walter Company. We believe this rebranding and consolidation will allow for greater focus on our consumers, will enhance brand recognition as mortgage loans originated by Ditech Financial will be serviced by the same brand, will simplify the process and improve quality for the consumer and will provide us with greater opportunities to cross-sell. We are focused on increasing our recapture rates from the serviced portfolio and believe the enhanced brand recognition will contribute to improving our recapture performance. The consolidation will also enable us to better leverage our resources and talent across the businesses and is expected to drive operational efficiencies. In addition, we exited the Originations segment's consumer retail channel in January 2016 and have focused on developing our Originations segment's consumer direct channel. Further, we have made and are continuing to make investments in technology which are designed to facilitate the originations process for borrowers.\nOperational Efficiency\nIn 2015, we began taking actions across our businesses to improve efficiency and reduce expenses. For example, we captured opportunities for enhanced benefits from shared services and the acceleration of automation efforts. We believe that the actions we took are likely to provide at least $75 million in annual cost savings beginning in 2016. One-time costs associated with the implementation of these initiatives were approximately $15 million.\nIn conjunction with our exit from the Originations segment's consumer retail channel in January 2016, we continued our expense reduction efforts and further reorganized Ditech Financial in an attempt to improve our efficiency. One-time costs associated with the measures taken in January 2016 are estimated to be approximately $5 million. The consumer retail channel incurred a direct margin loss of approximately $11 million in 2015. In addition to the elimination of this loss in future annual periods, the January 2016 reorganization activities are expected to result in additional annual cost savings of approximately $17 million. Further, as part of our ongoing technology improvement and customer experience enhancement initiatives, we commenced a project in February 2016 to review many of our operating processes. We expect to complete our initial review of such processes in the second quarter of 2016 and plan to move forward with implementation of identified action items thereafter.\nWhile we have been successful in implementing certain cost saving initiatives and we plan to continue to take actions across our businesses to improve efficiency and reduce expense, certain other costs have risen or are expected to rise. For example, we have been making investments and taking other measures to enhance the structure and effectiveness of our compliance and risk processes and associated programs across the Company, with a view to driving continuous improvements in our compliance results. The mortgage industry generally, including our Company, is subject to extensive and evolving regulation and continues to be under scrutiny from federal and state regulators and other government agencies. This oversight has led, in our case, to ongoing investigations and examinations of several of our business areas, and we have been and will be required to dedicate internal and external resources to providing information to and otherwise cooperating with such regulators and government agencies. In addition, we have incurred, and expect that in the future we will incur, expenses (i) associated with the remediation or other resolution of findings or concerns raised by regulators, government agencies and customers, (ii) to enhance the effectiveness of our risk and compliance program and (iii) to otherwise rectify instances of operational issues and other events of noncompliance discovered through our compliance program or otherwise. These investments to enhance our compliance and risk processes are also intended to result in an improved customer experience and competitive advantage for our business.\nFinancing Transactions\nRefer

servicing right or act as sub-servicer. This revenue includes contractual fees earned on the serviced loans, incentive and performance fees earned based on the performance of certain loans or loan portfolios serviced by us, and loan modification fees. Servicing revenue and fees also includes asset recovery income, which is included in incentive and performance fees, and ancillary fees such as late fees and expedited payment fees. Servicing revenue and fees are adjusted for the amortization and change in fair value of servicing rights and the change in fair value of the servicing rights related liabilities.\nServicing fees increased $33.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $130.8 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to growth in the third-party servicing portfolio resulting from portfolio acquisitions and servicing rights capitalized as a result of our loan origination activities, partially offset by runoff of the servicing portfolio. Incentive and performance fees decreased $39.6 million for 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to lower modification fees, fees earned under HAMP and asset recovery income, partially offset by higher real estate owned management fees. Ancillary and other fees increased $16.3 million for 2015 as compared to 2014 and $11.3 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to growth in the mortgage loan servicing portfolio. Refer to the Servicing segment discussion under our Business Segment Results section below for additional information on the changes in fair value relating to servicing rights and our servicing rights related liabilities.\nNet Gains on Sales of Loans\nNet gains on sales of loans include realized and unrealized gains and losses on loans held for sale, fair value adjustments on IRLCs and other related freestanding derivatives, values of the initial capitalized servicing rights, and a provision for the repurchase of loans. Net gains on sales of loans decreased $8.3 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $136.8 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of a shift in volume from the higher margin retention channel to the lower margin correspondent channel, partially offset by higher volumes of locked loans.\nInterest Income on Loans\nWe earn interest income on the residential loans held in the Residual Trusts and on our unencumbered mortgage loans, both of which are accounted for at amortized cost. During April 2015, we sold our residual interest in seven of the Residual Trusts, or sale of residual interests, and deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of these trusts. Interest income decreased $60.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to the aforementioned sale of our residual interests in 2015, runoff of the overall mortgage loan portfolio and a lower average yield on loans due to an increase in delinquencies that are 90 days or more past due.\nInterest income decreased $10.1 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to runoff of the overall mortgage loan portfolio and a lower average yield on loans due to an increase in delinquencies that are 90 days or more past due.\nProvided below is a summary of the average balances of residential loans carried at amortized cost and the related interest income and average yields (dollars in thousands):\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential loans at amortized cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(60,190\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,096\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average balance (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>800,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,372,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,465,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(571,587\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92,839\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.52\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.07\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Average balance is calculated as the average recorded investment in the loans at the beginning of each month during the year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Net Fair Value Gains on Reverse Loans and Related HMBS Obligations\nNet fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations include the contractual interest income earned on reverse loans, including those not yet securitized or bought out of securitization pools, net of interest expense on HMBS related obligations, and the change in fair value of these assets and liabilities. Refer to the Reverse Mortgage segment discussion under our Business Segment Results section below for additional information including a detailed breakout of the components of net fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations.\nNet fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations decreased $11.7 million during 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to the widening of spreads resulting from changes in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS and a lower reduction of LIBOR in 2015 as compared to 2014, offset partially by an increase in cash generated by origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs.\nNet fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations decreased $10.4 million during 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to lower cash generated by origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs, offset partially by the tightening of spreads from changes in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS and a reduction of LIBOR.\nInsurance Revenue\nInsurance revenue consists of commission income and fees earned on voluntary and lender-placed insurance policies issued and other products sold to borrowers, net of estimated future policy cancellations. Commission income is based on a percentage of the premium of the insurance policy issued, which varies based on the type of policy. Insurance revenue decreased $23.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $13.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to a decrease in commissions earned related to lender-placed insurance policies resulting from regulatory changes and runoff of existing policies. Due to changes in GSE requirements and regulations that limited our ability to charge commissions for lender-placed insurance policies, our sales commissions related to lender-placed insurance policies began to decrease in June 2014. During 2014, these lower commissions were partially offset by commissions earned from an increase in lender-placed insurance policies issued prior to the effective date of the regulatory changes related to 2013 and early 2014 bulk servicing right acquisitions. In addition, in September 2015 we entered into an agreement to settle a litigation matter pursuant to which we have agreed not to receive commissions as a result of the placement of certain lender-placed insurance policies. We believe we have accrued the full amount expected to be paid under the settlement agreement at December 31, 2015. As a result of this settlement (and the potential sale of our insurance business), we expect a further reduction in our insurance revenues in 2016.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues consists primarily of asset management performance fees, the change in fair value of charged-off loans, income associated with our beneficial interest in a servicing asset, and origination fee income. Other revenues decreased $1.6 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to $36.8 million in asset management performance fees collected and earned by our Other non-reportable segment in connection with the investment management of a fund during 2014 and $7.5 million in lower income from our beneficial interest in a servicing asset. The performance fees were earned in connection with the liquidation of the fund's investments during 2014 and are based on the fund exceeding pre-defined thresholds. These fees are recorded when the fund is terminated or when the likelihood of claw-back is improbable. The decrease in these revenues was partially offset by $19.3 million in higher fair value gains relating to charged-off loans as a result of twelve months of collection activity in 2015 compared to eight months in 2014 and an increase in expected collections; $17.7 million in higher origination fee income resulting from the refinancing of mortgage loans partially offset by lower fees charged to new reverse loan borrowers; and $6.2 million in higher other interest income. Origination fee income was $40.6 million and $22.9 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOther revenues increased $37.3 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to $36.8 million in the aforementioned asset management performance fees, a $22.5 million gain in fair value on charged-off loans acquired in 2014 and $4.5 million increase in income from our beneficial interest in a servicing asset. These increases were partially offset by $22.6 million in lower origination fee income resulting primarily from lower fees charged to borrowers for refinancing mortgage loans. Origination fee income was $22.9 million and $45.5 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits decreased $1.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits resulting from a lower average headcount during 2015, partially offset by an increase in share-based compensation due largely to a higher number of awards granted and the acceleration of expense associated with a former employee's unvested awards, and increases in bonuses and severance. Headcount decreased by approximately 800 full-time employees from approximately 6,700 at December 31, 2014 to approximately 5,900 at December 31, 2015.\nSalaries and benefits increased $28.8 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in the number of employees as a result of hiring to support the growth of our servicing business and corporate operations. Headcount increased by approximately 300 full-time employees from approximately 6,400 at December 31, 2013 to approximately 6,700 at December 31, 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative\nRefer to the Business Segment Results section below for additional information regarding general and administrative expenses for each of our segments.\nInterest Expense\nWe incur interest expense on our corporate debt, mortgage-backed debt issued by the Residual Trusts, master repurchase agreements and servicing advance liabilities, all of which are accounted for at amortized cost. Interest expense decreased $29.5 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to decreases in interest expense related to mortgage-backed debt and servicing advance liabilities, partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to master repurchase agreements. Interest expense related to mortgage-backed debt decreased primarily as a result of the sale of our residual interests, which required the deconsolidation of the related mortgage-backed debt, and the runoff of the overall related mortgage loan portfolio. Interest expense related to servicing advance liabilities decreased due primarily to a lower average interest rate, offset partially by a higher average balance outstanding. Interest expense related to master repurchase agreements, which are utilized to fund purchases and originations of mortgage loans and reverse loans, increased primarily as a result of a higher average outstanding balance, which is due largely to a higher volume of mortgage loan fundings, partially offset by a lower average interest rate.\nInterest expense increased $30.4 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to corporate debt transactions throughout 2013, which included incremental borrowings under our 2012 Term Loan and related subsequent refinancing activities under our 2013 Term Loan and the issuance of our Senior Notes. These financing transactions resulted in a higher average balance of our corporate debt, but a lower average interest rate as compared to 2013. In addition, interest expense increased as a result of a higher average balance of servicing advance liabilities, which are utilized to finance servicer and protective advances, due to our growing servicing business. These increases were partially offset by decreases in interest expense related to mortgage-backed debt and master repurchase agreements. Interest expense related to mortgage-backed debt decreased as a result of a lower average outstanding balance as the portfolio continues to run off. Interest expense related to master repurchase agreements decreased primarily as a result of a lower average interest rate. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for additional information on our debt.\nProvided below is a summary of the average balances of our corporate debt, mortgage-backed debt of the Residual Trusts, servicing advance liabilities, and master repurchase agreements, as well as the related interest expense and average rates (dollars in thousands):\nTable 159: <table><tr><td>

The goodwill evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2015 indicated the estimated implied fair value of the Servicing reporting unit's goodwill at the evaluation date was less than its book value, therefore requiring an impairment charge of $151.0 million. The goodwill evaluations performed in the second quarters of 2015 and 2014 indicated the estimated implied fair value of the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit's goodwill at each evaluation date was less than its book value, therefore requiring impairment charges of $56.5 million and $82.3 million, respectively. As a result of these goodwill impairment charges, the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit no longer has goodwill. Refer to Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for further discussion.\nGains (Losses) on Extinguishments\nDuring 2015, we recognized a $4.7 million net gain on extinguishment of debt. We recognized a gain of $5.7 million related to the repurchase of Senior Notes with a carrying value of $35.7 million and an unpaid principal balance of $36.3 million for $30.0 million and a loss of $1.0 million related to the write-off of issue costs resulting from the voluntary payment of $50.0 million on the 2013 Term Loan.\nDuring 2013, we recognized a $12.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt resulting from a $300.0 million early repayment of the 2012 Term Loan with proceeds from our Senior Notes and the refinancing of the remaining $1.4 billion 2012 Term Loan (including incremental borrowings) with our $1.5 billion 2013 Term Loan.\nOther Net Fair Value Gains\nOther net fair value gains consists primarily of fair value gains and losses on the assets and liabilities of the Non-Residual Trusts and fluctuates generally based on changes in prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity, LIBOR rates and discount rates. Other net fair value gains decreased $11.9 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the reduction of discount rates utilized in the valuations of the assets and liabilities of the Non-Residual Trusts in 2014 resulting from tightening of yields in the market. Other net fair value gains increased $13.2 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the aforementioned reduction of discount rates in 2014 as well as a $4.8 million loss incurred in 2013 related to an increase in the contingent earn-out liability related to a business acquisition.\nOther Gains (Losses)\nOther gains of $21.0 million for 2015 include an $11.8 million gain recognized on the sale of an investment which was accounted for using the equity method; an $8.9 million realized gain recognized on the sale of a trading security; a $3.1 million gain for consideration received for the contribution of Marix; and a $2.8 million loss recognized on the sale of our residual interests. In 2015, we received and subsequently sold a trading security as consideration for the sale of the excess servicing spread associated with certain servicing rights.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nOur effective tax rate will always differ from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% due to state and local taxes and non-deductible expenses. Refer to Note 24 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. statutory tax rate.\nIncome tax benefit increased $132.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to the increase in loss before income taxes offset by the impact on income taxes for non-deductible expenses such as the impairment of goodwill of the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit. These items were partially offset by a lower release of uncertain tax positions associated with state and local taxes due to a lapse in the statute of limitations from $3.6 million in 2014 to $2.1 million in 2015.\nThe change of $168.4 million from income tax expense in 2013 to an income tax benefit in 2014 was due primarily to the change from income before income taxes in 2013 to a loss before income taxes in 2014, offset by the impact on income taxes for non-deductible expenses such as the goodwill impairment. In addition, during 2014 we released $3.6 million from the aforementioned liability for unrecognized tax benefits associated with state and local taxes.\nFinancial Condition - Comparison of Consolidated Financial Condition at December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2014\nOur total assets and total liabilities decreased by $358.1 million and $86.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014. The most significant changes in assets and liabilities are described below.\nResidential loans at amortized cost decreased $773.1 million primarily as a result of the sale of our residual interests and the runoff of the overall related mortgage loan portfolio.\nResidential loans at fair value increased $840.8 million primarily as a result of the growth in our reverse loan portfolio and higher fundings of mortgage loans which outpaced sales, offset in part by a lower fair value adjustment on reverse loans. The fair value adjustment decreased as a result of wider pricing spreads, partially offset by lower LIBOR.\nServicer and protective advances decreased $165.2 million primarily as a result of collections of servicer and protective advances.\nGoodwill decreased $207.6 million due to a non-cash impairment charge to the asset carrying value recorded during the second and fourth quarters of 2015. The impairment testing is performed on each of our reporting units on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. At June 30, 2015, our analysis indicated impairment of the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit's goodwill, and as such we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $56.5 million. The primary cause of the goodwill impairment in the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit was the decline in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as a result of operational challenges in its retail origination channel; a reduction in opportunities for additional sub-servicing business; a greater than originally anticipated deferral of cash flows to future years with respect to previously introduced product changes; recent regulatory developments that could impact the likelihood of curtailment events in future periods; increasing liquidity requirements for the repurchase of certain HECMs and real estate owned from Ginnie Mae securitization pools; and an increase in obligations surrounding curtailment-related items existing at the time of the RMS acquisition. These factors resulted in reduced and delayed cash flows in the reverse mortgage business.\nSimilar to 2014, the Company's share price continued to experience volatility during 2015. As a result, the Company reassessed its market capitalization and the implications that the decline in market capitalization had on the carrying value of its goodwill. Our October 1, 2015 analysis indicated that the carrying amount of our Servicing reporting unit's goodwill exceeded its implied fair value and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $151.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This impairment was primarily the result of higher discount rates applied to forecasted cash flows driven by the decline in our stock price, which has been impacted by continued challenges in our industry, market developments, as well as the impact these factors have had on certain Company specific matters. Refer to Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for further discussion regarding goodwill impairment.\nDeferred tax asset, net of $108.1 million in 2015 changed by $194.7 million from a deferred tax liability, net of $86.6 million in 2014. The change in deferred taxes was primarily a result of the current year operating loss, which increased the net operating loss carryforwards; the tax impact of the sale of our residual interests; differences in tax and GAAP bases and recovery methods for servicing rights; the sales of excess servicing spreads and servicing rights during the year; and an increase in the curtailment liability primarily related to the reverse mortgage business. These items were partially offset by decreases in accrued expenses related to legal and regulatory matters and tax amortization of deductible goodwill.\nServicing advance liabilities, which are utilized to finance servicer and protective advances, decreased $136.6 million primarily as a result of collections of servicer and protective advances, which are used to settle balances outstanding.\nMortgage-backed debt decreased $688.1 million primarily as a result of the sale of our residual interests, which required the deconsolidation of the related mortgage-backed debt.\nHMBS related obligations increased $695.5 million due primarily to the securitization of reverse loans, partially offset by the repurchase of certain HECMs and real estate owned from securitization pools.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe manage our Company in three reportable segments: Servicing, Originations and Reverse Mortgage. We measure the performance of our business segments through the following measures: income (loss) before income taxes, Adjusted Earnings, and Adjusted EBITDA. Management considers Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA, both non-GAAP financial measures, to be important in the evaluation of our business segments and of the Company as a whole, as well as for allocating capital resources to our segments. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental metrics utilized by management to assess the underlying key drivers and operational performance of the continuing operations of the business. In addition, analysts, investors, and creditors may use these measures when analyzing our operating performance. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and our use of these measures and terms may vary from other companies in our industry.\nAdjusted Earnings is defined as income (loss) before income taxes plus changes in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs and other assumptions; certain depreciation and amortization costs related to the increased basis in assets (including servicing rights and sub-servicing contracts) acquired within business combination transactions (or step-up depreciation and amortization); goodwill impairment, if any; the provision for curtailment expense, net of expected third-party recoveries, as described in footnote two to the Adjusted Earnings table below; share-based compensation expense; non-cash interest expense; restructuring costs; estimated settlements and costs for certain legal and regulatory matters; fair value to cash adjustments for reverse loans; and select other cash and non-cash adjustments primarily including certain non-recurring costs; severance; gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; the net impact of the Non-Residual Trusts; and transaction and integration costs. Adjusted Earnings excludes unrealized changes in fair value of MSRs that are based on projections of expected future cash flows and prepayments. Adjusted Earnings includes both cash and non-cash gains from mortgage loan origination activities. Non-cash gains are net of non-cash charges or reserves provided. Adjusted Earnings includes cash generated from reverse mortgage origination activities. Adjusted Earnings may from time to time also include other adjustments, as applicable based upon facts and circumstances, consistent with the intent of providing investors with a supplemental means of evaluating our operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) before income taxes; amortization of servicing rights and other fair value adjustments; interest expense on corporate debt; depreciation and amortization; goodwill impairment, if any; the provision for curtailment expense, net of expected third-party recoveries, as described in footnote one to the Adjusted EBITDA table below; share-based compensation expense; restructuring costs; estimated settlements and costs for certain legal and regulatory matters; fair value to cash adjustments for reverse loans; and select other cash and non-cash adjustments primarily certain non-recurring costs; the net provision for the repurchase of loans sold; non-cash interest income; severance; gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; interest income on unrestricted cash and cash equivalents; the net impact of the Non-Residual Trusts; the provision for loan losses; Residual Trust cash flows; transaction and integration costs; and servicing fee economics. Adjusted EBITDA includes both cash and non-cash gains from mortgage loan origination activities. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of fair value option accounting on certain assets and liabilities and includes cash generated from reverse mortgage origination activities. Adjusted EBITDA may also include other adjustments, as applicable based upon facts and circumstances, consistent with the intent of providing investors a supplemental means of evaluating our operating performance.\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to (i) net income (loss) or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP or (ii) operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations of these metrics are:\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash expenditures for long-term assets and other items that have been and will be incurred, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect certain tax payments that represent reductions in cash available to us;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect non-cash compensation which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the change in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs and other assumptions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the change in fair value resulting from the realization of expected cash flows; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our servicing rights related liabilities and corporate debt, although it does reflect interest expense associated with our servicing advance liabilities, master repurchase agreements, mortgage-backed debt, and HMBS related obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Because of these limitations, Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA only as supplements. Users of our financial statements are cautioned not to place undue reliance on Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe following tables reconcile Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA to loss before income taxes, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nAdjusted Earnings\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(404,426\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs and other assumptions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Step-up depreciation and amortization (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Curtailment expense (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal and regulatory matters (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring costs (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value to cash adjustment for reverse loans (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sub-total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>524,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents depreciation and amortization costs related to the increased basis in assets, including servicing and sub-servicing rights, acquired within business combination transactions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Represents the provision for curtailment expense, net of expected third-party recoveries, related to historical practices at RMS which have led to increasing exposure for historical periods as regulatory requirements are clarified.

Sub-servicing portfolio acquisitions include new sub-servicing performed for WCO. The decrease in the unpaid principal balance of our on-balance sheet residential loans and real estate owned of $735.5 million can be attributed to the sale of our residual interests, which resulted in the deconsolidation of the related loans, combined with the overall portfolio runoff of the assets held by the Residual and Non-Residual Trusts, partially offset by an increase in mortgage loans held for sale of $213.8 million. The unpaid principal balance of loans associated with the sale of the seven Residual Trusts is included in our third-party servicing portfolio at December 31, 2015 since we continue to service these loans.\nThe overall delinquencies associated with our third-party servicing portfolio decreased at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 primarily because the new loans we originated and

Additionally there was a $13.1 million benefit recognized during 2014 from the settlement of differences in views between a prior servicer and the Company on how certain fees were recognized under a contract that was not recognized during the current year. Average loans serviced increased by $17.1 billion, or 8%, in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nIncentive and performance fees include modification fees, fees earned under HAMP, asset recovery income, and other incentives. Modification fees and fees earned under HAMP decreased $30.4 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to a lower volume of completed modifications and lower fees for maintenance of performing modified loans no longer eligible for HAMP incentive fees. We expect to modify fewer loans in the future as a result of the scheduled termination of HAMP in December 2016 and there being a fewer number of loans in our servicing portfolio eligible for modification. In addition, asset recovery income decreased $7.9 million for 2015 as compared to 2014 as a result of lower gross collections due primarily to the runoff of the related loans managed by the Servicing segment. Incentives relating to the performance of certain loan pools serviced by us decreased $2.8 million for 2015 as compared to 2014. We expect incentives relating to the performance of loan pools serviced by us to continue to decline as a result of market and other factors, including changes in incentive programs, runoff of the related loan portfolio and improving economic conditions, which may reduce the opportunity to earn these incentives.\nAncillary and other fees, which primarily include late fees and expedited payment fees, increased $13.6 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to growth in the servicing portfolio.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nServicing fees increased $131.2 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to growth in the third-party servicing portfolio resulting from portfolio acquisitions and servicing rights capitalized as a result of our loan origination activities, partially offset by runoff of the servicing portfolio. Average loans serviced increased by $38.2 billion, or 20%, in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nIncentives relating to the performance of certain loan pools serviced by us decreased $9.1 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. Asset recovery income decreased by $5.1 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 as a result of lower gross collections due primarily to the runoff of the related loans managed by the Servicing segment. Modification fees and fees earned under HAMP increased $8.8 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due to a higher volume of completed modifications as well as successful maintenance of the modified loans under performing status.\nAncillary and other fees increased $11.7 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to growth in the servicing portfolio.\nProvided below is a summary of the average unpaid principal balance of loans serviced and the related average servicing fee for our Servicing segment (dollars in thousands):\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average unpaid principal balance of loans serviced (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244,736,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>227,589,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,365,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,146,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,223,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average servicing fee (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.01\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Average unpaid principal balance of loans serviced is calculated as the average of the average monthly unpaid principal balances.

The reduction in fair value of these servicing rights in 2015 was attributed to a loss of $157.3 million in changes in valuation inputs or other assumptions and a loss of $244.7 million in other changes in fair value which reflect the impact of the realization of expected cash flows resulting from both regularly scheduled and unscheduled payments and payoffs of loan principal.\nThe loss resulting from changes in valuation inputs or other assumptions of $157.3 million in 2015 was due primarily to a higher discount rate at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014, an increase in the assumed conditional prepayment rate and an increase in FHFA's house pricing index. The higher assumed conditional prepayment rate was primarily due to actual interest rates being lower than what the market forward interest rate curves had projected for future periods as of December 31, 2014. In addition, the assumed conditional prepayment rate was impacted by a change in mix with the growth of the Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae servicing rights. The conditional default assumption was lower primarily as a result of the aforementioned refinement of our valuation model.\nOther changes in fair value above consist of the realization of expected cash flows. The increase in realization of expected cash flows of $95.7 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 was due primarily to faster prepayment speeds than anticipated and a larger servicing portfolio resulting from acquisitions of servicing rights, including those from loan origination activities.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014\nThe loss resulting from changes in valuation inputs or other assumptions of $124.5 million in 2014 was due primarily to a higher assumed conditional prepayment rate at December 31, 2014 as compared to December 31, 2013, which was largely driven by a lower interest rate environment and an increase in the FHFA's housing price index, partially offset by lower future HARP opportunities. There was a decline in the assumed conditional default rate, which was driven by portfolio acquisitions in 2014 that had lower risk profiles, and accordingly, lower assumed conditional default rates. Discount rates were reduced based on observable market rates.\nIncluded in other changes in fair value above is the realization of expected cash flows and, during 2013, $12.9 million in servicing rights transferred to us for no consideration. The increase in realization of expected cash flows of $30.9 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due primarily to acquisitions of servicing rights, including those from loan origination activities, partially offset by slower prepayment speeds than anticipated.\nYear Ended December 31, 2013\nOur servicing rights carried at fair value primarily consist of servicing rights acquired since January 1, 2013. The gain resulting from changes in valuation inputs or other assumptions of $153.3 million during 2013 was due primarily to overall reductions to assumed conditional prepayment rates and conditional default rates since the acquisitions of the related servicing rights. The decline in assumed conditional prepayment rates resulted primarily from a higher interest rate environment, which was partially offset by the impact of HARP being extended in April 2013 through December 2015 and the increase in the FHFA's housing price index. The decline in assumed conditional default rates was due primarily to actual performance and the addition of lower delinquency loans to our servicing portfolio. Assumed discount rates remained relatively flat since the acquisitions of servicing rights during 2013. The extension of HAMP in May 2013 to December 2015 also contributed to the change in valuation inputs and other assumptions given expected growth in incentive fees.\nServicing Rights Related Liabilities\nThe loss in fair value relating to our servicing rights related liabilities of $7.7 million for 2015 is comprised of $7.7 million in loss in fair value relating to excess servicing spread liabilities and less than $0.1 million in loss in fair value relating to servicing rights financing. The loss in fair value relating to our servicing rights related liabilities of $2.8 million for 2014 is entirely related to an excess servicing spread liability. The loss in fair value relating to excess servicing rights liabilities increased by $4.9 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to the change in interest expense which relates to the accretion of fair value. The higher interest expense was mainly due to having the 2014 excess servicing spread financing the entire twelve month period of 2015 as opposed to six months in 2014.\nInterest Income on Loans\nInterest income decreased $60.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to the sale of our residual interests in 2015, runoff of the overall mortgage loan portfolio and a lower yield on loans due to an increase in delinquencies that are 90 days or more past due.\nInterest income decreased $10.2 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to runoff of the overall mortgage loan portfolio and a lower yield on loans due to an increase in delinquencies that are 90 days or more past due.\nInsurance Revenue\nInsurance revenue decreased $23.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $13.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of changes in GSE requirements and regulations that limited our ability to charge commissions for lender-placed insurance policies during 2014 that led to a decrease in our sales commissions related to lender-placed insurance policies beginning in June 2014 as well as runoff of existing policies. During 2014, these lower commissions were partially offset by commissions earned from an increase in lender-placed insurance policies issued prior to the effective date of the regulatory changes related to the 2013 and early 2014 bulk servicing right acquisitions.\nIntersegment Retention Revenue\nIntersegment retention revenue relates to fees for Servicing segment charges to our Originations segment for loan originations completed by the Originations segment that resulted from access to the Servicing segment's servicing portfolio for which there was a related capitalized servicing right. The decline in intersegment retention revenue of $9.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $19.3 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due primarily to the decline in funded retention volume for which there was an existing capitalized servicing right.\nNet Gains on Sales of Loans\nNet gains on sales of loans for the Company includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on loans as well as the changes in fair value of our IRLCs and other freestanding derivatives. A substantial portion of our gain on sales of loans is recognized at the time we commit to originate or purchase a loan at specified terms as we recognize the value of the IRLC at the time of commitment. The fair value of the IRLC includes our estimate of the fair value of the servicing right we expect to receive upon sale of the loan.\nBeginning in 2015, the Originations segment recognizes the initial fair value of the entire commitment, including the servicing rights component, on the date of the commitment, while the Servicing segment recognizes the change in fair value of the servicing rights component of our IRLCs and loans held for sale that occurs subsequent to the date of our commitment through the sale of the loan. Net gains on sale of loans for the Servicing segment consists of this change in fair value as well as net gains on sales of loans to third parties.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues increased $15.6 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of $19.3 million in higher fair value gains relating to charged-off loans resulting primarily from twelve months of collection activity in 2015 compared to eight months in 2014 and an increase in expected collections, and $4.3 million higher other interest income, partially offset by $7.5 million lower beneficial interest income related to a servicing asset.\nOther revenues increased $27.9 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to $22.5 million in higher fair value gains relating to charged-off loans that were purchased during 2014 and $4.5 million in higher beneficial interest income related to a servicing asset.\nGeneral and Administrative and Allocated Indirect Expenses\nGeneral and administrative and allocated indirect expenses decreased $27.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 resulting primarily from $40.7 million in lower legal related costs largely due to lower accruals for legal and regulatory matters outside of the ordinary course of business and $14.5 million in lower provision for uncollectible advances due to a decrease in advance balances and an improvement in collection experience, partially offset by $11.3 million in additional costs in 2015 to support efficiency and technology-related initiatives, $8.8 million in higher default and other loan servicing costs resulting from growth in the servicing portfolio, and $4.1 million in expenses relating to consolidating and re-branding our mortgage loan business as Ditech, a Walter Company.\nGeneral and administrative and allocated indirect expenses increased $131.8 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 resulting primarily from additional costs associated with growth in the servicing portfolio, which included a higher provision for uncollectible advances of $34.5 million, and $75.6 million in higher legal accruals for loss contingencies and legal expenses due to legal and regulatory matters outside of normal course of business. The higher provision for uncollectible advances is due to the growth in advances from servicing right acquisitions in 2013 and 2014, aging of balances and collection experience.\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits expense decreased $23.5 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a lower average headcount as a result of restructuring measures within our mortgage loan servicing operations, offset in part by severance incurred in relation to this restructuring. Headcount assigned directly to our Servicing segment decreased by approximately 600 full-time employees from 4,200 at December 31, 2014 to 3,600 at December 31, 2015.\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $34.9 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due to hiring to support the growth of our business, including the hiring of EverBank employees in 2014. Headcount assigned directly to our Servicing segment increased by approximately 500 full-time employees from 3,700 at December 31, 2013 to 4,200 at December 31, 2014.\nGoodwill Impairment\nWe incurred a $151.0 million impairment charge during 2015 as a result of a goodwill evaluation performed in the fourth quarter of 2015. The evaluation indicated the estimated implied fair value of the Servicing reporting unit's goodwill at the evaluation date was less than its book value, therefore requiring the impairment charge.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $36.4 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the sale of our residual interests and the runoff of the overall related mortgage loan portfolio.\nInterest expense increased $9.0 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of a higher average balance of servicing advance liabilities due to the growth of our servicing business as a result of portfolio acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on mortgage-backed debt issued by the Residual Trusts, as a result of a lower average outstanding balance as the related residential loan portfolio continues to runoff.\nOther Gains (Losses)\nOther gains of $6.1 million for 2015 includes an $8.9 million realized gain recognized on the sale of a trading security, partially offset by a $2.8 million loss recognized on the sale of our residual interests.\nAdjusted Earnings\nAdjusted Earnings margin decreased six basis points in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower revenues (adjusted for the impact of the change in fair value driven by changes in valuation inputs) per loan serviced, partially offset by lower expenses, primarily salaries and benefits, per loan serviced and a net gain resulting from the sale of a trading security and the sale of our residual interests. The decline in revenues per loan serviced is primarily due to the increase in realization of expected cash flows due mainly to faster prepayment speeds than anticipated and a larger servicing portfolio, and the decline in incentive and performance fees and insurance revenue.\nAdjusted Earnings margin decreased four basis points in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to lower revenues (adjusted for the impact of the change in fair value driven by changes in valuation inputs) per loan serviced which primarily resulted from the decline in incentive and performance fees, intersegment retention revenue and insurance revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA margin decreased two basis points in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower revenues (adjusted for the impact of the change in fair value) per loan serviced, partially offset by lower expenses, primarily salaries and benefits, per loan serviced and a net gain resulting from the sale of a trading security and the sale of our residual interests. The decline in revenues per loan serviced is primarily due to the decline in incentive and performance fees and insurance revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin decreased three basis points in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to lower revenues (adjusted for the impact of the change in fair value) per loan serviced which primarily resulted from the decline in incentive and performance fees, intersegment retention revenue and insurance revenue.\nProvided below is a summary of our Servicing segment's margin (in basis points):\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

Net Gains on Sales of Loans\nNet gains on sales of loans include realized and unrealized gains and losses on loans, the initial fair value of the capitalized servicing rights upon loan sales, as well as the changes in fair value of our IRLCs and other freestanding derivatives. The amount of net gains on sales of loans is a function of the volume and margin of our originations activity and is impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. A substantial portion of our gains on sales of loans is recognized at the time we commit to originate or purchase a loan at specified terms, as we recognize the value of the IRLC at the time of commitment. The fair value of the IRLC includes our estimate of the fair value of the servicing right we expect to receive upon sale of the loan. We recognize loan origination costs as incurred, which typically align with the date of loan funding for consumer originations and the date of loan purchase for correspondent lending. These expenses are primarily included in general and administrative expenses and salaries and benefits on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). In addition, we record a provision for losses relating to representations and warranties made as part of the loan sale transaction at the time the loan is sold.\nThe volatility in the gain on sale spread is attributable to market pricing, which changes with demand, channel mix, and the general level of interest rates. While many factors may affect consumer demand for mortgages, generally, pricing competition on mortgage loans is lower in periods of low or declining interest rates, as consumer demand is greater. This provides opportunities for originators to increase volume and earn wider margins. Conversely, pricing competition increases when interest rates rise as consumer demand lessens. This reduces overall origination volume and may lead originators to reduce margins. The level and direction of interest rates are not the sole determinant of consumer demand for mortgages. Other factors such as secondary market conditions, home prices, credit spreads or legislative activity may impact consumer demand more significantly than interest rates in any given period.\nNet gains on sales of loans for our Originations segment consists of the following (dollars in thousands):\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains on sales of loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>367,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(199,654\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in unrealized gains on loans held for sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,697\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,109\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(645\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,359\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(94\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains (losses) on interest rate lock commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,464\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,525\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(145\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,065\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains (losses) on forward sales commitments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,747\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(156,201\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(268,031\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(240\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Losses on MBS purchase commitments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,250\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,009\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,599\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,241\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,410\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>222\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized servicing rights\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>305,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>214,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for repurchases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,008\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,741\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,054\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,267\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains on sales of loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>448,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>462,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>594,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,639\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(132,169\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Realized gains (losses) on freestanding derivatives were $(67.0) million, $(134.8) million and $87.7 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The decrease in net gains on sales of loans in 2015 and 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year periods was primarily due to a shift in volume from the higher margin retention channel to the lower margin correspondent channel, offset partially by a higher volume of locked loans in each respective period. The higher volume of locked loans during 2015 as compared to 2014 was largely due to lower average interest rates in 2015, while the higher volume of locked loans in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due to having a full twelve months of activity in 2014 as opposed to a condensed period in 2013. Additionally, we had higher capitalized servicing rights during 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to a higher volume of loans sold as well as a change in mix from substantially all Fannie Mae in 2014 to approximately 35% Ginnie Mae, which have a higher servicing fee than GSE loans, and 65% Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in 2015. The condensed period in 2013 results from the acquisition of the capital markets and originations platforms from ResCap on January 31, 2013 and the correspondent lending business from Ally Bank on March 1, 2013. These acquisitions initiated the ramp up of our mortgage loan originations business.\nThe years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included the benefit of higher margins from HARP, which is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2016. HARP is a federal program of the U.S. which helps homeowners refinance their mortgage.

In addition, 2014 includes the impact of lower direct expenses resulting from economies of scale and cost cutting initiatives established to align activities with the scope and scale of operations at such time.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues, which consists primarily of origination fee income and interest on cash equivalents, increased $25.7 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, and decreased $16.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily as a result of lower origination fees in 2014 due to our having waived certain fees charged to borrowers refinancing mortgage loans.\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits expense remained flat in 2015 as compared to 2014. Although level between both years, 2015 had a decrease in compensation and benefits primarily due to lower average headcount and lower severance due mainly to the exit from the wholesale business in February 2014 and an office closure in 2014. These lower expenses were offset by higher incentives in 2015 due to an increase in funded volume, partially offset by the impact from the change in mix from higher incentive paying retention originations to lower incentive paying correspondent originations.\nSalaries and benefits expense decreased $12.4 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the reduction in workforce in order to align the employee base with the scope and scale of operations in 2014, which included our exit from the mortgage wholesale channel, partially offset by higher volume of loans funded during 2014 coupled with a full year of mortgage loan originations activity in 2014 as compared to a condensed period in 2013.\nGeneral and Administrative and Allocated Indirect Expenses\nGeneral and administrative and allocated indirect expenses increased $10.1 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to higher loan origination expenses due to an increased volume of loan fundings and increased advertising resulting from additional mail solicitations and internet lead generations as well as re-branding for our mortgage loan business under Ditech, a Walter Company. In addition, we had a larger reduction in 2014 to our estimate of the liability associated with our representations and warranties for sales of mortgage loans due to the prior year including a reduction to our reserves as a result of timely payment history on loans originated under HARP and lower actual origination defects as compared to original expectations. Under HARP, after one year of timely payments by the borrower since the origination of the loan, our exposure to the liability associated with representations and warranties becomes limited in nature. In the prior year, we had more loans completing one year of timely payments and such loans had higher initial reserves established due to a higher initial estimate of defects. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower occupancy, printing and mailing costs in support of cost savings measures.\nGeneral and administrative and allocated indirect expenses decreased $17.4 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the management of expenses to align with the scope and scale of operations in 2014, partially offset by a higher volume of loans funded during 2014 coupled with a full year of mortgage loan originations activity in 2014 as compared to a condensed period in 2013.\nIntersegment Retention Expense\nIntersegment retention expense relates to fees charged by our Servicing segment to the Originations segment in relation to loan originations that resulted from access to the Servicing segment's servicing portfolio for which there was a related capitalized servicing right recorded by the Servicing segment. The decline in intersegment retention expense of $9.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $19.3 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due primarily to the decline in funded retention volume for which there was an existing capitalized servicing right.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $6.6 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $1.4 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher average borrowings on master repurchase agreements due to higher volumes of loan fundings, partially offset by lower average costs of debt. In addition, there was a full year of mortgage loan originations activity in 2014 as compared to a condensed period in 2013.\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.1 million and $13.3 million, respectively, in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to higher origination fee income, offset partially by lower net gains on sales of loans and higher expenses. We had a higher net provision for the repurchase of loans due primarily to a shift in volume of originations from the retention channel to the correspondent channel, which has a higher estimated defect rate.\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA decreased $98.1 million and $100.9 million, respectively, in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to reduced net gains on sales of loans. During 2013, the business substantially ramped up operations due to first quarter 2013 acquisitions; therefore locked volume was significantly larger than funded volume. As a result, 2013 had higher revenues in relation to expenses. In 2014, the relationship of locked volume to funded volume normalized.\nReverse Mortgage\nProvided below is a summary of results of operations, Adjusted Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA for our

Included in the change in fair value are gains due to loan originations that include \"tails.\" Tails are participations in previously securitized HECMs and are created by additions to principal for borrower draws on lines-of-credit, interest, servicing fees, and mortgage insurance premiums. Economic gains and losses result from the pricing of an aggregated pool of loans exceeding the cost of the origination or acquisition of the loan as well as the change in fair value resulting from changes to market pricing on HECMs and HMBS. No gain or loss is recognized as a result of the securitization of reverse loans as these transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings. However, HECMs and HMBS related obligations are marked to fair value, which can result in a net gain or loss related to changes in market pricing.\nNet interest income increased $5.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the growth in both reverse loans and HMBS related obligations, offset partially by the increase in nonperforming reverse loans which have lower interest rates than performing loans. Cash generated by origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs included in the change in fair value increased $10.0 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of a shift in volume from lower margin new originations to higher margin tails. Net non-cash fair value adjustments included in the change in fair value fluctuated by $26.9 million from a gain in 2014 to a loss in 2015 due primarily to a lower reduction of LIBOR in 2015 as compared to 2014. In addition, in 2015 the impact of the reduction of LIBOR was offset by the widening of spreads between reverse loans and HMBS related obligations resulting from changes in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS. In 2014 there was a tightening of spreads. The conditional repayment rate utilized in the valuation of reverse loans and HMBS related obligations has increased from 21.68% and 21.21% at December 31, 2014, respectively, to 25.59% and 24.70% at December 31, 2015, respectively, as the portfolio ages and recent regulatory guidance surrounding due and payable policies has resulted in shorter projected default servicing timelines.\nWhile we had growth in both reverse loans and HMBS related obligations in 2014 as compared to 2013, we also had an increase in nonperforming reverse loans, which have lower interest rates than performing loans and as a result, net interest income was relatively flat. Cash generated by origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs included in the change in fair value decreased $53.9 million primarily as a result of lower margin new originations, partially offset by higher margin tails. Net non-cash fair value adjustments included in the change in fair value increased favorably by $42.6 million due to a reduction of LIBOR and the tightening of spreads between reverse loans and HMBS related obligations resulting from changes in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS.\nProvided below are summaries of our funded volume, which represents purchases and originations of reverse loans, and volume of securitizations into HMBS (dollars in thousands):\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funded volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,418,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,457,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,897,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,498\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,440,457\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securitized volume (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,465,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,480,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,882,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,342\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,402,259\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Securitized volume includes $404.0 million, $299.4 million and $189.4 million of tails securitized for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

In March 2015, we entered into an agreement with a counterparty to phase out the management of real estate owned through October 1, 2015. Fees associated with this contract approximated 63% and 75% of incentive and performance fees during 2015 and 2014, respectively, and as a result of the termination of the contract, we expect our incentive and performance fees to decline in 2016.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues include originations fee income and other miscellaneous income. Other revenues declined $4.9 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $3.6 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the decline in origination fee income resulting from fewer originations. In addition, during 2015 we charged lower fees to new borrowers.\nGeneral and Administrative and Allocated Indirect Expenses\nGeneral and administrative and allocated indirect expenses increased $15.0 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to a $10.2 million increase in expenses related to regulatory developments in 2015 which led to additional charges around curtailable events and to accrual adjustments associated with legal and regulatory matters outside of the normal course of business. In addition, there was a $6.8 million increase in curtailment due primarily to an increase in missed timelines driven by an increase in volume resulting from the contraction of default servicing timeframes due to recent regulatory changes and an increase in the related exposure to incurred but not known deaths of the mortgagor and the mortgagor's vacancy from their principal residence. Further there was a $2.8 million increase in advertising and a $6.9 million net increase in various miscellaneous expenses including real estate owned management support services, equipment maintenance and occupancy expenses. These higher charges were partially offset by $8.2 million in lower provisions on uncollectible receivables and advances resulting from improved collections and recent historical experience, as well as transaction costs of $3.5 million recorded in 2014 related to an unsuccessful acquisition, with no similar charge in 2015.\nGeneral and administrative and allocated indirect expenses increased $14.8 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, due primarily to $24.3 million in higher legal accruals for loss contingencies and legal expenses due to legal and regulatory matters outside of normal course of business and $3.5 million of transaction costs resulting from an unsuccessful acquisition. These expenses were partially offset by a decrease of $12.8 million in the provision for our curtailment liability and our provisions for uncollectible receivables and advances and insignificant variances related to other expenses.\nSalaries and Benefits\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $11.7 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to a larger average headcount during the current year, higher incentives and higher severance. Salaries and benefits expense remained relatively flat in in 2014 as compared to 2013. As a result of an increase in defaulted loans and recent regulatory guidance surrounding due and payable policies which have resulted in shorter projected default servicing timelines, we have increased our headcount of employees dedicated to such servicing.\nGoodwill Impairment\nWe incurred $56.5 million and $82.3 million in impairment charges during 2015 and 2014 as a result of goodwill evaluations performed in the second quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. The evaluations indicated the estimated implied fair value of the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit's goodwill at each evaluation date was less than its book value, therefore requiring the impairment charges. As a result of these goodwill impairment charges, the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit no longer has goodwill.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense remained relatively flat in 2015 as compared to 2014. Interest expense decreased $4.2 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to lower average borrowings on master repurchase agreements resulting from a lower volume of loan fundings and lower cost of debt.\nAdjusted Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted Loss increased $4.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.9 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. The changes in these non-GAAP financial measures was due primarily to the growth in cash generated from origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs and net servicing revenue and fees, offset partially by higher expenses.\nAdjusted Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA decreased $48.9 million and $48.8 million, respectively, in 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease in these non-GAAP financial measures was due primarily to the decline in cash generated from origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs\nOther Non-Reportable\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues for our Other non-reportable segment consists primarily of asset management performance fees, and to a lesser extent, asset management advisory fees and other interest income. Other revenues decreased $35.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to $36.8 million in asset management performance fees collected and earned in connection with the asset management of a fund during 2014, partially offset by the settlement of a receivable that was repaid in conjunction with the sale of an investment accounted for using the equity method during 2015.\nOther revenues increased $29.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to the aforementioned $36.8 million in asset management performance fees, partially offset by a decline in asset management advisory fees.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses for our Other non-reportable segment increased $10.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to higher salaries and benefits expense relating to increases in share-based compensation expense due largely to a higher number of awards granted and bonuses.\nTotal expenses for our Other non-reportable segment decreased $3.4 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to $30.4 million in lower general and administrative and allocated indirect expenses largely resulting from costs incurred to affect corporate debt financing transactions in 2013. Our corporate debt transactions during 2013 included incremental borrowings under our 2012 Term Loan, the related subsequent refinancing activities under our 2013 Term Loan and the issuance of our Senior Notes. The decrease in expenses was partially offset by a $24.3 million increase in interest expense on corporate debt resulting from these corporate debt transactions. These financing transactions resulted in a higher average balance of corporate debt of $502.9 million, partially offset by a lower average interest rate of 48 basis points, which resulted in a lower cost of debt.\nTotal Other Gains (Losses)\nTotal other gains increased $6.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to an $11.8 million gain recognized on the sale of an investment which was accounted for using the equity method; a $4.7 million net gain on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of Senior Notes and the voluntary prepayment on the 2013 Term Loan; and a $3.1 million gain for consideration received for the contribution of Marix to WCO. These gains were partially offset by $12.8 million in lower net fair value gains on the assets and liabilities of the Non-Residual Trusts as 2014 included the impact of changes in assumptions related to the reduction of discount rates resulting from tightening of yields in the market.\nTotal other gains of $20.1 million in 2014 increased $25.8 million from total other losses of $5.8 million in 2013 due primarily to a loss on extinguishment of debt of $12.5 million incurred in 2013, $8.6 million in higher fair value gains on the Non-Residual Trusts in 2014 resulting from the aforementioned reduction to discount rates, and a $4.8 million loss incurred in 2013 related to an increase in the contingent earn-out liability related to a business acquisition.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay debt and meet the financial obligations of our operations including funding acquisitions; mortgage loan and reverse loan servicing advances; obligations associated with the repurchase of reverse loans from securitization pools; funding additional borrowing capacity on reverse loans; origination of mortgage loans; and other general business needs, including the cost of compliance with changing legislation and related rules. Our liquidity is measured as our consolidated cash and cash equivalents excluding subsidiary minimum cash requirement balances, which are typically associated with our servicer licensing or financing agreements with third parties. This measure also includes our borrowing capacity available under the 2013 Revolver, as described under the Corporate Debt section below. At December 31, 2015, our liquidity was $256.7 million. At December 31, 2015, we had contractual obligations, subject to certain conditions and adjustments, to utilize approximately $27.7 million of this amount to fund acquisitions of servicing rights, including related servicer and protective advances, and certain payment obligations under our asset purchase agreement with RCS.\nWe endeavor to maintain our liquidity at a level sufficient to fund certain known or expected payments and to fund our working capital needs. Our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our business segments and funds available from our 2013 Revolver, master repurchase agreements, mortgage loan servicing advance facilities, issuance of HMBS and excess servicing spread financing arrangements. We may generate additional liquidity through sales of MSRs, any portion thereof, or other assets.\nWe believe that, based on current forecasts and anticipated market conditions, our current liquidity, along with the funds generated from our principal sources of liquidity discussed above, will allow for financial flexibility to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund operating needs and expenses, servicing advances, loan originations and repurchases of mortgage loans and HECMs, planned capital expenditures, current committed business and asset acquisitions, and all required debt service obligations for the next 12 months. We expect that significant acquisitions of servicing rights and other opportunities to grow by acquisition would need to be funded primarily through, or in collaboration with, external capital sources. Our operating cash flows and liquidity are significantly influenced by numerous factors, including interest rates and continued availability of financing. Our liquidity outlook assumes the renewal of existing mortgage loan servicing advance facilities, mortgage loan and reverse loan master repurchase agreements and reverse loan master repurchase agreements to fund repurchases of HECMs. In addition, management from time to time pursues other financing facilities. We may access the capital markets from time to time, in public or in private transactions, to augment our liquidity position, fund growth opportunities or for other reasons. We continually monitor our cash flows and liquidity in order to be responsive to changing conditions.\nWe have an effective universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time an indeterminate number of our securities, including common stock, debt securities, preferred stock, warrants and units, having an aggregate initial offering price not to exceed $1.5 billion. This universal shelf registration statement expires on or about January 13, 2018.\nShare Repurchase Plan\nOn May 6, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized us to repurchase up to $50.0 million of shares of our common stock, during the period beginning on May 11, 2015 and ending on May 31, 2016. Repurchases may be made from time to time based upon our discretion through one or more open market or privately negotiated transactions, and pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. The timing and amounts of any such repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of our shares and general market and economic conditions. The share repurchase program may be extended, suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had repurchased 2,382,733 shares of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase plan at an aggregate cost of $28.1 million, or an average cost of $11.78 per share. Shares of common stock that we repurchase are canceled and return to the status of authorized but unissued shares.\nMortgage Loan Servicing Business\nOur servicing agreements impose on us various rights and obligations that affect our liquidity. Among the most significant of these obligations is the requirement that we advance our own funds to pay taxes, insurance and foreclosure costs and various other items, referred to as protective advances. Protective advances are required to preserve the collateral underlying the residential loans being serviced. In addition, we advance our own funds to meet contractual payment requirements for credit owners. As a result of bulk servicing right acquisitions in 2013 and 2014, we experienced and continue to incur an elevated level of advance requirements. Sub-servicers are generally reimbursed for advances in the month following the advance, so our advance funding requirements may be reduced if we succeed in increasing the fee-for-service mix in our servicing portfolio. In the normal course of business, we borrow money from various counterparties who provide us with financing to fund a portion of our mortgage loan related servicing advances on a short-term basis or provide for reimbursement within an agreed-upon period. Our ability to fund servicing advances is a significant factor that affects our liquidity, and to operate and grow our servicing portfolio we depend upon our ability to secure these types of arrangements on acceptable terms and to renew or replace existing financing facilities as they expire. However, there can be no assurance that these facilities will be available to us in the future. The servicing advance financing agreements that support our servicing operations are discussed below.\nServicing Advance Liabilities\nWe have four servicing advance facilities through several lenders and an Early Advance Reimbursement Agreement with Fannie Mae which, in each case, are used to fund servicer and protective advances that are our responsibility under certain servicing agreements. The servicing advance facilities and the Early Advance Reimbursement Agreement had an aggregate capacity amount of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2015. The interest rates are either fixed or are primarily based on LIBOR plus between 2.30% and 4.40% and have various expiration dates through October 2018. Payments on the amounts due under these agreements are paid from proceeds received by the subsidiaries (i) in connection with the liquidation of mortgaged properties, (ii) from repayments received from mortgagors, or (iii) from reimbursements received from the owners of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and private label securitization trusts. Accordingly, repayment of the servicing advance liabilities is dependent on the proceeds that are received on the underlying advances associated with the agreements. Two of the servicing advance facilities, with total borrowing capacity of $1.2 billion, are non-recourse to the Company.\nServicing Advance Facilities\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $1.1 billion outstanding under all servicing advance facilities which have an aggregate capacity of $1.3 billion. The servicing advance facilities contain customary events of default and covenants, including financial covenants. Financial covenants most sensitive to our operating results and financial position are the requirements that a subsidiary maintain minimum tangible net worth, indebtedness to tangible net worth and minimum liquidity. Our subsidiary was in compliance with these financial covenants at December 31, 2015.\nWe are party to a servicer advance financing facility that provides funding for servicer and protective advances made by Ditech Financial in connection with its servicing of certain Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage loans. On October 21, 2015, this facility was amended and restated to provide for the issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of term notes consisting of Series 2015-T1 one-year term notes with an initial aggregate principal balance of $360.0 million and Series 2015-T2 three-year term notes with an initial aggregate principal balance of $140.0 million; to extend the commitment for up to $600.0 million of previously issued Series 2014-VF2 variable funding notes until October 2016; and to reduce total borrowing capacity under this facility by $100.0 million to $1.1 billion in the aggregate. The proceeds from the issuance of the Series 2015-T1 term notes and the Series 2015-T2 term notes were used to reduce the outstanding principal balance of the Series 2014-VF2 variable funding notes and to pay certain transaction fees, costs and expenses.\nThe maximum permitted principal balance of the variable funding notes that can be drawn at any given time is dependent upon the amount of eligible collateral owned by the issuer of the notes and, after giving effect to the issuance of the Series 2015-T1 term notes and the Series 2015-T2 term notes, may not exceed $600.0 million in the aggregate.\nThe collateral securing the term notes and the variable funding notes consists primarily of rights to reimbursement for servicer and protective advances in respect of certain mortgage loans serviced by Ditech Financial on behalf of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.\nEach series of term notes and variable funding notes were issued in four classes. Interest on the term notes is based on a fixed rate per annum ranging from approximately 2.30% to 3.93% for the Series 2015-T1 term notes and 3.09% to 4.67% for the Series 2015-T2 term notes. The interest on the variable funding notes is based on one-month LIBOR, (or, in certain circumstances, the higher of (i) the prime rate and (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%) plus a per annum margin ranging from approximately 2.34% to 4.36%.\nIf the Series 2015-T1 term notes are not redeemed or refinanced on or prior to October 17, 2016, and the Series 2015-T2 term notes are not redeemed or refinanced on or prior to October 15, 2018, one-twelfth of the related note balances will be required to be repaid on each monthly payment date thereafter. Failure to make any such one-twelfth payment will result in an event of default. We may repay and redraw the variable funding notes issued for 364-days from and including October 21, 2015, subject to the satisfaction of various funding conditions. If such 364-day period is not extended, the variable funding notes will become due and payable on October 19, 2016.\nUnder this facility, creditors of the issuer and depositor entities (including the holders of the term notes and variable funding notes) have no recourse to any assets or revenues of Ditech Financial or the Parent Company other than to the limited extent of Ditech Financial's or the Parent Company's obligations with respect to various representations and warranties, covenants and indemnities under this facility and the Parent Company's obligations as a guarantor of certain of Ditech's representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities under the facility. Creditors of the Parent Company and Ditech Financial do not have recourse to any assets or revenues of either the issuer or depositor entities under the facility.\nThe facility's base indenture and indenture supplements include facility events of default and target amortization events customary for financings of this type, including but not limited to target amortization events related to breaches of covenants, defaults under certain other material indebtedness, material judgments, certain tests related to the collection and performance of the receivables securing the notes issued pursuant to the base indenture and the applicable indenture supplement, and with respect to the variable funding notes, certain financial tests and change of control. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, specified percentages of noteholders have the right to terminate all commitments and accelerate the notes under the base indenture, enforce their rights with respect to the collateral and take certain other actions. The events of default include, among other events, the occurrence of any failure to make payments (subject to certain cure periods and including balances due after the occurrence of a target amortization event), failure of Ditech Financial to satisfy various deposit and remittance obligations as servicer of certain mortgage loans, the requirement of a subsidiary, Green Tree Agency Advance Funding Trust I, to be registered as an investment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, certain tests related to the collection and performance of the receivables securing the notes issued pursuant to the base indenture and applicable indenture supplement, removal of Ditech Financial's status as an approved seller or servicer by either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and bankruptcy events.\nIn connection with this facility, we entered into an acknowledgment with Fannie Mae, dated as of December 19, 2014, and an amended and restated consent agreement with Freddie Mac, dated as of October 21, 2015, which (i) in the case of Fannie Mae, waived or (ii) in the case of Freddie Mac, subordinated, their respective rights of set-off against rights to reimbursement for certain servicer advances and delinquency advances subject to this facility. The Fannie Mae acknowledgment agreement remains in effect unless Fannie Mae withdraws its consent (i) at each yearly anniversary of the agreement by providing thirty days' advance written notice or (ii) upon certain other specified events. The Freddie Mac consent agreement automatically renews for successive annual terms; however, Freddie Mac may terminate its consent on 30 days' written notice. If either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac were to withdraw such waiver or subordination, as applicable, of its respective rights of set-off, our ability to increase the draws on the variable funding notes or maintain the drawn balances thereunder could be materially limited or eliminated.\nEarly Advance Reimbursement Agreement\nDitech Financial's Early Advance Reimbursement Agreement with Fannie Mae is used exclusively to fund certain principal and interest, servicer and protective advances that are the responsibility of Ditech Financial under its Fannie Mae servicing agreements. This agreement was renewed in April 2015 and now expires in March 2016. If not renewed, there will be no additional funding by Fannie Mae of new advances under the agreement. In addition, collections recovered during the 18 months following the expiration of the agreement are to be remitted to Fannie Mae to settle any remaining outstanding balance due under such agreement. Upon expiration of the 18 month period, any remaining balance would become due and payable. At December 31, 2015, we had borrowings of $156.7 million under the Early Advance Reimbursement Agreement, which has a capacity of $200.0 million.\nMortgage Loan Originations Business\nMaster Repurchase Agreements\nWe utilize master repurchase agreements to support our origination or purchase of mortgage loans. These agreements were entered into by Ditech Financial. The five facilities had an aggregate capacity of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, the interest rates on the facilities were primarily based on LIBOR plus between 2.10% and 3.00% and have various expiration dates through October 2016. These facilities provide creditors a security interest in the mortgage loans that meet the eligibility requirements under the terms of the particular facility in exchange for cash proceeds used to originate or purchase mortgage loans. We agree to repay borrowings under these facilities within a specified timeframe, and the source of repayment is typically from the sale or securitization of the underlying loans into the secondary mortgage market. We evaluate our needs under these facilities based on forecasted mortgage loan origination volume; however, there can be no assurance that these facilities will be available to us in the future. The aggregate capacity includes $1.0 billion of committed funds and $1.3 billion of uncommitted funds. To the extent uncommitted funds are requested to purchase or originate mortgage loans, the counterparties have no obligation to fulfill such request. All obligations of Ditech Financial under the master repurchase agreements are guaranteed by the Parent Company. We had $1.2 billion of short-term borrowings under these master repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015, which included $305.8 million of borrowings utilizing uncommitted funds.\nAll of our master repurchase agreements contain customary events of default and covenants, the most significant of which are financial covenants. Financial covenants that are most sensitive to the operating results and resulting financial position are minimum tangible net worth requirements, indebtedness to tangible net worth ratio requirements, and minimum liquidity and profitability requirements.\nOn June 22, 2015, as a result of a group of affiliated stockholders of the Company publicly disclosing on a Schedule 13D filing with the SEC that it had acquired beneficial ownership in excess of 20% of the outstanding common stock of the Company, a change of control\u201d event of default occurred under a master repurchase agreement relating to one of our mortgage warehouse facilities, which then caused a cross-default\u201d event of default to occur under certain other master repurchase agreements relating to certain additional mortgage warehouse facilities. We promptly obtained waivers for such change of control\u201d event of default and each related cross-default\u201d event of default from all applicable lenders. The master repurchase agreement under which the change of control\u201d event of default occurred was also amended to remove the change of control provision as it relates to the Parent Company.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2015, two of Ditech Financial's master repurchase agreements were amended to allow for a net loss under their respective minimum profitability covenants. Without these amendments, Ditech Financial would not have been in compliance with these covenants for the quarter ended December 31, 2015.\nAs a result of Ditech Financial obtaining these amendments, we were in compliance with all financial covenants relating to master repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015.\nRepresentations and Warranties\nIn conjunction with our originations business, we provide representations and warranties on loan sales. We sell substantially all of our originated or purchased mortgage loans into the secondary market for securitization or to private investors as whole loans. We sell conventional conforming and government-backed mortgage loans through GSE and agency-sponsored securitizations in which mortgage-backed securities are created and sold to third-party investors. We also sell non-conforming mortgage loans to private investors. In doing so, representations and warranties regarding certain attributes of the loans are made to the third-party investor. Subsequent to the sale, if it is determined that a loan sold is in breach of these representations or warranties, we generally have an obligation to cure such breach. In general, if we are unable to cure such breach, the purchaser of the loan may require us to repurchase such loan for the unpaid principal balance, accrued interest, and related advances, and in any event, we must indemnify such purchaser for certain losses and expenses incurred by such purchaser in connection with such breach. Our credit loss may be reduced by any recourse we have to correspondent lenders that, in turn, have sold such residential loans to us and breached similar or other representations and warranties.\nOur representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits of exposure with the exception of certain loans originated under HARP, which limits exposure based on payment history of the loan. At December 31, 2015, our maximum exposure to repurchases due to potential breaches of representations and warranties was $51.3 billion, and was based on the original unpaid principal balance of loans sold from the beginning of 2013 through the year ended December 31, 2015 adjusted for voluntary payments made by the borrower on loans for which we perform the servicing. A majority of our loan sales were servicing retained.\nRollforwards of the liability associated with representations and warranties are included below (in thousands):\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for new sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in estimate of existing reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,419\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,068\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized losses on repurchases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,403\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(848\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at end of the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change in estimate of existing reserves during 2014 is due primarily to timely payment history on loans originated under HARP and lower history of actual origination defects as compared to original expectation.\nRollforwards of loan repurchase requests based on the original unpaid principal balance are included below (dollars in thousands):\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>No. of Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unpaid Principal Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>No. of Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unpaid Principal Balance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchases and indemnifications\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(81\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,568\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,607\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Claims initiated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rescinded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(215\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49,640\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,240\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at end of the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReverse Mortgage Business\nMaster Repurchase Agreements\nThrough RMS's warehouse facilities under master repurchase agreements we finance the origination or purchase of reverse loans and repurchases of certain HECMs and real estate owned from Ginnie Mae securitization pools. At December 31, 2015, we had a facility with a capacity of $125.0 million that could be used to originate or purchase reverse loans and another facility with a capacity of $100.0 million that could be used to repurchase HECMs and real estate owned from Ginnie Mae securitization pools. The interest rates on the facilities are primarily based on LIBOR plus between 2.50% and 3.13% and have expiration dates through October 2016. These facilities are secured by the underlying asset and provide creditors a security interest in the assets that meet the eligibility requirements under the terms of the particular facility. We agree to repay the borrowings under these facilities within a specified timeframe, and the source of repayment is typically from proceeds received on the securitization of the underlying reverse loans, claim proceeds received from HUD or liquidation proceeds from the sale of real estate owned. We evaluate our needs under these facilities based on forecasted reverse loan origination volume and repurchases; however, there can be no assurance that these facilities will be available to us in the future. At December 31, 2015, $175.0 million of the aggregate capacity has been provided on an uncommitted basis, and as such, to the extent these funds are requested to purchase or originate reverse loans or repurchase HECMs and real estate owned from Ginnie Mae securitization pools, the counterparties have no obligation to fulfill such request. All obligations of RMS under the master repurchase agreements are guaranteed by the Parent Company. We had $122.3 million of borrowings under these master repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015 which included $87.4 million of borrowings relating to repurchases of HECMs and real estate owned.\nAll of our master repurchase agreements contain customary events of default and covenants, the most significant of which are financial covenants. Financial covenants that are most sensitive to the operating results and resulting financial position are minimum tangible net worth requirements, indebtedness to tangible net worth ratio requirements, and minimum liquidity and profitability requirements. RMS was in compliance with its financial covenants relating to master repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015.\nReverse Loan Securitizations\nWe transfer reverse loans that we have originated or purchased through the Ginnie Mae HMBS issuance process. The proceeds from the transfer of the HMBS are accounted for as a secured borrowing and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets as HMBS related obligations. The proceeds from the transfer are used to repay borrowings under our master repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2015, we had $10.0 billion in unpaid principal balance outstanding on the HMBS related obligations. At December 31, 2015, $10.0 billion in unpaid principal balance of reverse loans and real estate owned was pledged as collateral to the HMBS beneficial interest holders, and are not available to satisfy the claims of our creditors. Ginnie Mae, as guarantor of the HMBS, is obligated to the holders of the HMBS in an instance of RMS default on its servicing obligations, or when the proceeds realized on HECMs are insufficient to repay all outstanding HMBS related obligations. Ginnie Mae has recourse to RMS in connection with certain claims relating to the performance and obligations of RMS as both an issuer of HMBS and a servicer of HECMs underlying HMBS.\nBorrower remittances received on the reverse loans, if any, and proceeds received from the sale of real estate owned and our funds used to repurchase reverse loans are used to reduce the HMBS related obligations by making payments to Ginnie Mae, who will then remit the payments to the holders of the HMBS. The maturity of the HMBS related obligations is directly affected by the liquidation of the reverse loans or liquidation of real estate owned and events of default as stipulated in the reverse loan agreements with borrowers. Refer to the below for additional information on repurchases of reverse loans.\nHMBS Issuer Obligations\nAs an HMBS issuer, we assume certain obligations related to each security issued. The most significant obligation is the requirement to purchase loans out of the Ginnie Mae securitization pools once the outstanding principal balance of the related HECM is equal to or greater than 98% of the maximum claim amount. Performing repurchased loans are conveyed to HUD and payment is received from HUD typically within 30 days of repurchase. Non-performing repurchased loans are generally liquidated through foreclosure and subsequent sale of real estate owned. Loans are considered non-performing upon events such as, but not limited to, the death of the mortgagor, the mortgagor no longer occupying the property as their principal residence, or the property taxes or insurance not being paid. We rely upon certain master repurchase agreements and operating cash flows, to the extent necessary, to repurchase loans. The timing and amount of our obligation to repurchase HECMs is uncertain as repurchase is predicated on certain factors such as whether or not a borrower event of default occurs prior to the HECM reaching the mandatory repurchase threshold under which we are obligated to repurchase the loan.\nRollforwards of reverse loan and real estate owned repurchase activity (by unpaid principal balance) are included below (in thousands):\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchases and other additions (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>333,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(214,362\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83,559\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at end of the year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>233,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Other additions include additions to the principal balance related to interest, servicing fees, mortgage insurance and advances.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our repurchases of reverse loans and real estate owned have increased significantly as compared to 2014. We expect an increase to repurchase requirements due to the increased flow of defaulted HECMs and real estate owned that have moved through the buyout process.\nReverse Loan Servicer Obligations\nSimilar to our mortgage loan servicing business, our reverse mortgage servicing agreements impose on us obligations to advance our own funds to meet contractual payment requirements for customers and credit owners and to pay protective advances, which are required to preserve the collateral underlying the residential loans being serviced. We rely upon operating cash flows to fund these obligations.\nAs servicer of reverse loans, we are also obligated to fund additional borrowing capacity in the form of undrawn lines of credit on floating rate and fixed rate reverse loans. We rely upon our operating cash flows to fund these additional borrowings on a short-term basis prior to securitization (when performing services of both the issuer and servicer) or reimbursement by the issuer (when providing third-party servicing). The additional fundings made by us, as issuer and servicer, are generally securitized within 30 days after funding. Similarly, the additional fundings made by us, as third-party servicer, are typically reimbursed by the issuer within 30 days after funding. Our commitment to fund additional borrowing capacity was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2015, which includes $868.3 million in capacity that was available to be drawn by borrowers at December 31, 2015 and $475.9 million in capacity that will become eligible to be drawn by borrowers throughout the twelve months ending December 31, 2016 assuming the loans remain performing. There is no termination date for these drawings so long as the loan remains performing. The obligation to fund these additional borrowings could have a significant impact on our liquidity.\nServicing Rights Related Liabilities\nExcess Servicing Spread Liabilities\nIn July 2014, we completed an excess servicing spread transaction with WCO whereby we sold 70% of the excess servicing spread from a pool of servicing rights, with an unpaid principal balance of $25.2 billion, to WCO for a sales price of $75.4 million. In November 2015, we completed an additional excess servicing spread transaction with WCO whereby we sold 100% of excess servicing spread from a pool of servicing rights, with an unpaid principal balance of $7.5 billion, to WCO for a sales price of $46.8 million. We recognized the proceeds from the sales of the excess servicing spreads as financing arrangements. We elected to record the excess servicing spread liabilities at fair value similar to the related servicing rights. At December 31, 2015, the carrying value of our excess servicing spread liabilities was $100.1 million, the repayment of which is based on future servicing fees received from the residential loans underlying the servicing rights.\nServicing Rights Financing\nIn November 2015, we completed the sale of servicing rights, with an unpaid principal balance of $1.8 billion, to WCO for a sales price of $17.8 million. We recognized the proceeds from the sale of the servicing rights as a financing arrangement. We elected to record the servicing rights financing at fair value similar to the related servicing rights. The repayment of such financing is based on future servicing fees received from the residential loans underlying the servicing rights. At December 31, 2015, the carrying value of our servicing rights financing and the related servicing rights was $16.9 million. We have a receivable due from WCO for this sale of $8.9 million at December 31, 2015. In November 2015, we also entered into a sub-servicing arrangement with WCO pursuant to which we will sub-service the residential loans underlying such servicing rights in exchange for a sub-servicing fee.\nCorporate Debt\nTerm Loans and Revolver\nWe have a $1.5 billion 2013 Term Loan and a $125.0 million 2013 Revolver. Our obligations under the 2013 Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our assets subject to certain exceptions, such as the assets of the consolidated Residual and Non-Residual Trusts and consolidated financing entities, as well as the residential loans and real estate owned of the Ginnie Mae securitization pools that have been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe material terms of our 2013 Secured Credit Facilities are summarized in the table below:\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity/Expiration\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$1.5 billion 2013 Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR plus 3.75%\nLIBOR floor of 1.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00% per annum beginning 1st quarter of 2014; remainder at final maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 18, 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$125.0 million 2013 Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR plus 3.75%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Bullet payment at maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 19, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAn amount of up to $25.0 million under the 2013 Revolver is available to be used for the issuance of LOCs. Any amounts outstanding in issued LOCs reduce availability for cash borrowings under the 2013 Revolver. There have been no borrowings under the 2013 Revolver. At December 31, 2015, we had $0.3 million outstanding in an issued LOC with remaining availability under the 2013 Revolver of $124.7 million. The commitment fee on the unused portion of the 2013 Revolver is 0.50% per annum. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we made a voluntary payment of $50.0 million on our 2013 Term Loan that resulted in a loss on extinguishment of $1.0 million due to the write-off of the related issue costs. The loss on extinguishment is recorded in gains (losses) on extinguishments on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The balance outstanding on the 2013 Term Loan was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2015.\nThe 2013 Secured Credit Facilities contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase our capital stock, make certain types of investments, create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries, incur certain liens, sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all of our assets to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The 2013 Secured Credit Facilities also contain customary events of default, including the failure to make timely payments on the 2013 Term Loan and 2013 Revolver or other material indebtedness, the failure to satisfy certain covenants and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency. We were in compliance with all covenants contained in our 2013 Secured Credit Facilities at December 31, 2015.\nSenior Notes\nIn December 2013, we completed the sale of $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, which pay interest semi-annually at an interest rate of 7.875% and mature on December 15, 2021. The balance outstanding on the Senior Notes was $528.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nThe Senior Notes were offered and sold in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act, and resold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of December 17, 2013, among the Company, the guarantor parties thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Senior Notes are guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by each of our current and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our 2013 Term Loan. On October 14, 2014, we filed with the SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act so as to allow holders of the Senior Notes to exchange their Senior Notes for the same principal amount of a new issue of notes with identical terms, except that the exchange notes are not subject to certain restrictions on transfer. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on October 27, 2014, the exchange offer expired on November 25, 2014, and settlement occurred on December 2, 2014.\nOn or prior to December 15, 2016, we may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at 107.875% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date. Prior to December 15, 2016, we may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a make-whole premium plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as of the redemption date.\nOn or after December 15, 2016, we may on any one or more occasions redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 105.906% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as of the redemption date, such optional redemption prices decreasing to 103.938% on or after December 15, 2017, 101.969% on or after December 15, 2018 and 100.000% on or after December 15, 2019.\nIf a change of control, as defined under the Senior Notes Indenture, occurs, the holders of our Senior Notes may require that we purchase with cash all or a portion of these Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.\nThe Senior Notes Indenture contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, limits our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase our capital stock, make certain types of investments, create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries, incur certain liens, sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all of our assets to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The Senior Notes Indenture also contains customary events of default, including the failure to make timely payments on the Senior Notes or other material indebtedness, the failure to satisfy certain covenants and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency. We were in compliance with all covenants contained in the Senior Notes Indenture at December 31, 2015.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased Senior Notes with a carrying value of $35.7 million and an unpaid principal balance of $36.3 million for $30.0 million that resulted in a gain on extinguishment of $5.7 million, which is recorded in gains (losses) on extinguishments on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nConvertible Notes\nIn October 2012, we closed on a registered underwritten public offering of $290.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes pay interest semi-annually on May 1 and November 1, commencing on May 1, 2013, at a rate of 4.50% per annum, and mature on November 1, 2019.\nPrior to May 1, 2019, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon specified events and during specified periods, and, on or after May 1, 2019, at any time. The Convertible Notes will initially be convertible at a conversion rate of 17.0068 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $58.80 per share. Upon conversion, we may pay or deliver, at our option, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. It is our intent to settle all conversions through combination settlement, which involves payment of an amount of cash equal to the principal amount and any excess of conversion value over the principal amount in shares of common stock.\nAs market conditions warrant, we may from time to time, subject to limitations as stated in our 2013 Secured Credit Facilities, repurchase debt securities issued by us, in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.\nMortgage-Backed Debt\nWe funded the residential loan portfolio in the consolidated Residual Trusts through the securitization market. We record on our consolidated balance sheets the assets and liabilities, including mortgage-backed debt, of the Non-Residual Trusts as a result of certain obligations to exercise mandatory clean-up calls for each of these trusts at their earliest exercisable dates. The mortgage-backed debt issued by the Residual Trusts is accounted for at amortized cost. The mortgage-backed debt of the Non-Residual Trusts is accounted for at fair value. The total unpaid principal balance of mortgage-backed debt was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2015.\nAt December 31, 2015, mortgage-backed debt was collateralized by $1.1 billion of assets including residential loans, receivables related to the Non-Residual Trusts, real estate owned and restricted cash and cash equivalents. All of the mortgage-backed debt is non-recourse and not cross-collateralized and, therefore, must be satisfied exclusively with the proceeds from the residential loans and real estate owned held in each securitization trust and also from draws on the LOCs of certain Non-Residual Trusts.\nBorrower remittances received on the residential loans of the Residual and Non-Residual Trusts collateralizing this debt and draws under LOCs issued by a third-party and serving as credit enhancements to certain of the Non-Residual Trusts are used to make payments on the mortgage-backed debt. The maturity of the mortgage-backed debt is directly affected by the rate of principal prepayments on the collateral. As a result, the actual maturity of the mortgage-backed debt is likely to occur earlier than the stated maturity. Certain of our mortgage-backed debt issued by the Residual Trusts is also subject to voluntary redemption according to the specific terms of the respective indenture agreements, including an option by us to exercise a clean-up call. The mortgage-backed debt issued by the Non-Residual Trusts is subject to mandatory clean-up call provisions pursuant to which we are required to purchase the related mortgage loans from the trusts at the earliest of their exercisable call dates, which is the date each loan pool falls to 10% of the original principal amount. We anticipate the mandatory call obligations to settle beginning in 2017 and continuing through 2019 based upon our current cash flow projections for the Non-Residual Trusts. At December 31, 2015, the total estimated outstanding balance of the residential loans expected to be called at the respective call dates is $417.6 million. We expect to finance the capital required to exercise the mandatory clean-up call primarily through cash on hand, asset-backed financing or in partnership with a capital provider, or through any combination of the foregoing. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell the loans or obtain financing when needed. Our obligation for the mandatory clean-up call could have a significant impact on our liquidity.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes, by remaining maturity, our future cash

The Receivables Loan Agreement and the Indenture Agreement are non-recourse to us. Payments under these facilities are required upon collection of the underlying advances that have been reimbursed under the agreement.\nOur servicing rights related liabilities have been excluded from the table above as repayment is based on future servicing fees received from residential loans underlying the servicing rights.\nWe exclude mortgage-backed debt from the contractual obligations disclosed in the table above as this debt is non-recourse and not cross-collateralized and, therefore, must be satisfied exclusively from the proceeds of the residential loans and real estate owned held in the securitization trusts and by the $260.4 million in LOCs available for certain Non-Residual Trusts.\nOperating lease obligations include (i) a lease for our principal operating location in Tampa, Florida; (ii) leases for our centralized servicing operations in Saint Paul, Minnesota; Tempe, Arizona; Rapid City, South Dakota; Irving, Texas; and Jacksonville, Florida; (iii) leases related to our reverse mortgage operations located in San Diego, California; Charlotte, North Carolina; Palm Beach Gardens, Florida; and Houston, Texas; (iv) a lease for our originations operations located in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania; and (v) other regional servicing and originations operations.\nCertain Capital Requirements and Guarantees\nWe, including our subsidiaries, are required to comply with requirements under federal and state laws and regulations, including requirements imposed in connection with certain licenses and approvals, as well as requirements of federal, state, GSE, Ginnie Mae and other business partner loan programs, some of which are financial covenants related to minimum levels of net worth and other financial requirements. If these mandatory imposed capital requirements are not met, our selling and servicing agreements could be terminated and lending and servicing licenses could be suspended or revoked. For further information relating to these requirements, including certain Ginnie Mae and Fannie Mae waivers and certain guarantees provided by the Parent Company, refer to Note 28 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.\nNoncompliance with those requirements for which we have not received a waiver could have a negative impact on our company which could include suspension or termination of the selling and servicing agreements which would prohibit future origination or securitization of mortgage loans or being an approved seller or servicer for the applicable GSE.\nAfter taking into account the waivers mentioned at Note 28 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, all of our subsidiaries were in compliance with all of their capital requirements at December 31, 2015.\nWe also have financial covenant requirements relating to our servicing advance facilities and master repurchase agreements. Refer to additional information at the Mortgage Loan Servicing Business, Mortgage Loan Originations Business and Reverse Mortgage Business sections above for further information.\nDividends\nWe have no current plans to pay any cash dividends on our common stock. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants in our 2013 Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture.

Cash used in operating activities decreased $156.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of an increase in cash related to changes in assets and liabilities, including higher collections of servicer and protective advances and an increase in accrued expenses related to uncertain tax positions, partially offset by higher settlements of payables relating to servicer and protective advances acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of servicing rights and a decrease in accrued expenses related to legal and regulatory matters. In addition, cash increased due to proceeds received from the sale of a trading security received as consideration for the sale of the excess servicing spread associated with certain servicing rights. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash related to a lower volume of loans sold in relation to originated loans.\nCash used in operating activities decreased $1.6 billion in 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily a result of a higher volume of loans sold in relation to originated loans. In 2013, we ramped-up our mortgage loan originations business, therefore, loan originations were significantly larger than volume sold. In 2014, the relationship of loan production to volume sold normalized. In addition, during 2013, the growth of our servicing portfolio required the use of additional funds for servicer and protective advances of $778.0 million of cash, which represents a majority of the changes in assets and liabilities in 2014 as compared to 2013 in the table above.\nInvesting Activities\nThe primary sources and uses of cash for investing activities relate to purchases, originations and payment activity on reverse loans, payments received on mortgage loans held for investment, and payments made for business and servicing rights acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $789.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. Cash used for purchases and originations of reverse loans held for investment, net of payments received, decreased $357.1 million during 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of an increase in principal repayments on loans and payments received for loans conveyed to HUD. Cash paid for business acquisitions and purchases of servicing rights decreased $195.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. In addition, we received cash proceeds of $203.9 million from the sale of residual interests and the sale of an investment in 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $2.5 billion in 2014 as compared to 2013. Cash used for purchases and originations of reverse loans held for investment, net of payments received, decreased $1.7 billion as a result of a decrease in new origination volume in our reverse mortgage operations. Cash paid for business acquisitions and purchases of servicing rights also decreased $823.8 million. The cash used in 2014 for business acquisitions and purchases of servicing rights includes cash used for the purchase of the EverBank net assets and a pool of Fannie Mae MSRs while the cash used in 2013 relates to the acquisitions of net assets from ResCap and Ally Bank as well as the BOA asset purchase. In addition, during 2014 we acquired a $64.5 million portfolio of charged-off loans.\nFinancing Activities\nThe primary sources and uses of cash for financing activities relate to securing cash for our originations, reverse mortgage and servicing businesses, as well as for our corporate investing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased $891.0 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. Net cash borrowings from servicing advance liabilities used to fund advances for our servicing business decreased $528.3 million primarily as a result of less funding of advances principally driven by lower cash needed to fund servicer and protective advances as well as higher collections of advances, which are used to settle balances outstanding. Cash generated from the securitization of reverse loans, net of payments on HMBS related obligations, decreased $383.1 million primarily as a result of an increase in the repurchase of certain HECMs and real estate owned from securitization pools. Payments on corporate debt increased due to a $50.0 million voluntary debt payment made on the 2013 Term Loan and the repurchase of Senior Notes with a carrying value of $35.7 million and an unpaid principal balance of $36.3 million for $30.0 million. In addition, in 2015 we entered into an excess servicing spread transaction with, and sold servicing rights to, WCO, which provided $55.7 million in cash.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $4.4 billion in 2014 as compared to 2013. Cash generated from the securitization of reverse loans, net of payments on HMBS related obligations, decreased $1.8 billion as a result of a decrease in new origination volume in our reverse mortgage operations. Net cash borrowings from servicing advance liabilities used to fund advances for our servicing business decreased $476.5 million primarily as a result of less funding of advances principally driven by lower levels of servicing right acquisitions in 2014. Net cash borrowings on master repurchase agreements decreased $738.8 million due primarily to the ramp-up of our mortgage loan originations business in 2013. Net cash generated from corporate debt financing activities decreased $2.8 billion as a result of additional incremental borrowings under our 2012 Term Loan during 2013 with no comparable borrowings during 2014. During 2014, we entered into an excess servicing spread transaction with WCO which provided $75.4 million in cash.\nCredit Risk\nConsumer Credit Risk\nIn conjunction with our originations business, we provide representations and warranties on loan sales. Subsequent to the sale, if it is determined that a loan sold is in breach of these representations or warranties, we generally have an obligation to cure such breach. In general, if we are unable to cure such breach, the purchaser of the loan may require us to repurchase such loan for the unpaid principal balance, accrued interest, and related advances, and in any event, we must indemnify such purchaser for certain losses and expenses incurred by such purchaser in connection with such breach. In the case we repurchase the loan, the Company bears any subsequent credit loss on the loan. Our credit loss may be reduced by any recourse we have to correspondent lenders that, in turn, have sold such residential loans to us and breached similar or other representations and warranties. We maintain a reserve for losses on our representations and warranties obligations. Refer to Notes 5 and 29 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 and to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information. At December 31, 2015, we held $8.2 million in repurchased loans.\nWe are also subject to credit risk associated with mortgage loans that we purchase and originate during the period of time prior to the sale of these loans. We consider the credit risk associated with these loans to be insignificant as we hold the loans for a short period of time, typically less than 20 days, and the market for these loans continues to be highly liquid.\nCounterparty Credit Risk\nWe are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to various agreements, including our forward sales and MBS purchase commitments. We attempt to minimize this risk through monitoring procedures, including monitoring of our counterparties' credit ratings, review of our counterparties' financial statements, and establishment of collateral requirements. Counterparty credit risk, as well as our own credit risk, is taken into account when determining fair value, although its impact is diminished by daily cash margin posting on the majority of our forward sales and MBS purchase commitments and other collateral requirements.\nCounterparty credit risk also exists with our third-party originators from whom we purchase originated mortgage loans and certain third-party originators from whom we acquire serving rights. The third-party originators incur a representation and warranty obligation when they sell the mortgage loan to us or another third party, and they agree to reimburse us for any losses incurred due to an origination defect. We become exposed to losses for origination defects if the third-party originator is not able to reimburse us for losses incurred for indemnification or repurchase. We attempt to mitigate this risk by conducting quality control reviews of the third-party originators, reviewing compliance by third-party originators with applicable underwriting standards and our client guide, and evaluating the credit worthiness of third-party originators on a periodic basis.\nReal Estate Market Risk\nWe include on our consolidated balance sheets assets secured by real property and property obtained directly as a result of foreclosures. Residential property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of housing); changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans, which could also cause us to suffer losses.\nThe

whose maximum claim amount has not been met is generally foreclosed upon on behalf of Ginnie Mae with the real estate owned remaining in the securitization pool until liquidation. Although performing and non-performing loans are covered by FHA insurance, we may incur expenses and losses in the process of repurchasing and liquidating these loans that are not reimbursable by FHA in accordance with program guidelines. In addition, in certain circumstances, we may be subject to real estate price risk to the extent we are unable to liquidate real estate owned within the FHA program guidelines. We attempt to mitigate this risk by monitoring the aging of real estate owned and managing our marketing and sales program based on this aging. The growth in the real estate owned portfolio held by the Reverse Mortgage segment was due to growth in our business and the increased flow of HECMs that move through the foreclosure process.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nOur consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of our assets and liabilities are, or are based on, financial assets. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nRatings\nWe receive various credit and servicer ratings as set forth below. Our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Rating agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security.\nCredit Ratings\nCredit ratings are intended to be an indicator of the creditworthiness of a particular company, security or obligation and are considered by lenders in connection with the setting of interest rates and terms for a company's borrowings. The following table summarizes our credit ratings and outlook as of the date of this report.\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate / CCR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>B2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>B+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Secured Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>B2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BB-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Unsecured Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>B3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>B-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outlook\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Date of Last Action\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 2015\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nServicer Ratings\nResidential loan and manufactured housing servicer ratings reflect the applicable rating agency's assessment of a servicer's operational risk and how the quality and experience of the servicer affect loan performance.

From time to time we, our vendors and other companies that store or process confidential borrower personal and transactional data are targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious code and viruses or otherwise attempting to breach the security of our or our vendors' systems and data. We employ extensive layered security at all levels within our organization to help us detect malicious activity, both from within the organization and from external sources. It is company protocol to investigate the cause and extent of all instances of cyber-attack, potential or confirmed, and take any additional necessary actions including: conducting additional internal investigation; engaging third-party forensic experts; updating our defenses; and involving senior management. We have established, and continue to establish on an ongoing basis, defenses to identify and mitigate these cyber-attacks, and although these cyber-attacks have on occasion penetrated certain defenses, they have not, to date, resulted in any material disruption to our operations and have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, loss, unauthorized access to, or misuse of confidential or personal information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, employees and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn August of 2014, the Company was notified by the United States Secret Service of potential unauthorized access to certain computer applications residing on servers operated on behalf of Ditech Financial. We retained a team of forensic experts to investigate the incident to determine the scope of the data, if any, that was susceptible to unauthorized access. The forensic investigation did not identify conclusive evidence that data was in fact improperly accessed. We have been in contact with appropriate governmental agencies and have provided information to several state agencies in response to their requests. We have also notified identified individuals whose personal information we believe potentially might have been made accessible in the incident. In addition, we have taken and continue to take steps to further enhance the security of our data and defenses against future threats. Expenses incurred to date related to this incident have not been material. We may incur additional expenses in connection with this incident.\nIn addition to our vendors, other third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities (e.g., GSEs, transaction counterparties and financial intermediaries) could also be sources of cybersecurity risk to us, including with respect to breakdowns or failures of their systems, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyber-attacks which could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to us or result in lost or compromised information of us or our consumers. We work with our vendors and other third parties with whom we do business, to enhance our defenses and improve resiliency to cybersecurity threats. Systems failures could result in reputational damage to our business and cause us to incur significant costs and third-party liability, and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have certain off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nWe have exposure to representations and warranty obligations as a result of our loans sales activities. If it is determined that loans sold are in breach of these representations or warranties and we are unable to cure such breach, we generally have an obligation to either repurchase the loan for the unpaid principal balance, accrued interest, and related advances, and in any event, me must indemnify the purchaser of the loans for certain losses and expenses incurred by such purchaser in connection with such breach. Our credit loss may be reduced by any recourse we have to correspondent lenders that, in turn, have sold such residential loans to us and breached similar or other representations and warranties. We record an estimate of the liability associated with our representations and warranties exposure on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Notes 5 and 29 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for the financial effect of these arrangements and to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information.\nWe have a variable interest in WCO which provided financing to us during 2014 and 2015 through the sales of excess servicing spreads and servicing rights. The repayment of the excess servicing spread liabilities and servicing rights financing is based on future servicing fees received from the residential loans underlying the servicing rights. In addition, we perform sub-servicing for WCO. Refer to Notes 2 and 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for additional information on servicing activities. We also have other variable interests in other entities that we do not consolidate as we have determined we are not the primary beneficiary. Refer to Note 4 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nIncluded in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements located in Item 8 is a summary of our significant accounting policies. These policies are integral to the presentation of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While all of these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates, this section highlights and discusses the critical accounting policies that require management to make highly difficult, complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, then it may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe have an established and documented process for determining fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, or Level 1 inputs, and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs. A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Refer to Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for a description of valuation methodologies used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value and details on the valuation models, key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized.\nThe following table summarizes the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs (dollars in thousands):\nTable 259: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reverse loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,763,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,064,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans related to Non-Residual Trusts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>526,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>586,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charged-off loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Receivables related to Non-Residual Trusts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Servicing rights carried at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,682,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,599,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freestanding derivative instruments (IRLCs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets at fair value using Level 3 inputs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,089,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,393,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.71\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Freestanding derivative instruments (IRLCs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Servicing rights related liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-backed debt related to Non-Residual Trusts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>582,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>653,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HMBS related obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,647,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,951,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities at fair value using Level 3 inputs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,347,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,671,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.95\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen available, we generally use quoted market prices to determine fair value. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally-developed valuation models, such as a discounted cash flow model, that where possible, use current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as market rates commensurate with an instrument's credit quality and duration. We consider market liquidity when estimating fair value based on the type of asset or liability measured and the valuation method used. For example, for mortgage loans where the significant inputs have become unobservable due to illiquidity in the markets for non-agency and non-conforming mortgage loans, we use a discounted cash flow technique to estimate fair value. This technique incorporates forecasting of expected cash flows discounted at an appropriate market discount rate that is intended to reflect the lack of liquidity in the market. Level 3 unobservable assumptions reflect our own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nUnobservable inputs used in our internal valuation models require considerable judgment and are inherently difficult to estimate. Changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements. Accordingly, our estimates of fair value are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized or would be paid in a current market exchange. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from changes to inputs, the value of market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs.\nAll of the techniques used and information obtained in the valuation process provide a range of estimated values, which are evaluated in order to establish an estimated value that, based on management's judgment, represents a reasonable estimate of fair value. It is not uncommon for the range of value to vary widely, and in such cases, we select an estimated value that we believe is the best indication of value based on the yield a market participant in the current environment would expect.\nOur Valuation Committee determines and approves valuation policies and unobservable inputs used to estimate the fair value of items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Valuation Committee meets on a quarterly basis to review the assets and liabilities that require fair value measurement, including how each asset and liability has actually performed in comparison to the unobservable inputs and the projected performance provided by our Credit Risk Group. The Valuation Committee also reviews related available market data.\nThe changes to the fair value of our Level 3 assets and liabilities are discussed in the Results of Operations and Business Segment Results sections.\nReverse Loans and HMBS Related Obligations\nChanges in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS and LIBOR can have a material impact on fair value and our results of operations. We utilize and give priority to observable market inputs, such as interest rates and market spreads, in our valuation of reverse loans and HMBS related obligations. However, we also utilize unobservable inputs, such as repayment speeds, mortality assumptions and expected duration, and also consider the value of underlying collateral. These unobservable inputs require the use of our judgment and can also have a significant impact on the determination of fair value. The growth in reverse loans and HMBS related obligations at December 31 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 is due largely to new originations and higher loan balances for previously existing borrowers resulting primarily from tails, partially offset by the liquidation of reverse loans.\nNon-Residual Trusts\nWe utilize and give priority to observable market inputs, such as interest rates and market spreads, in our valuation of the assets and liabilities of the Non-Residual Trusts. However, we also utilize internal inputs, such as prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity and discount rates, and also consider the value of underlying collateral. These internal inputs require the use of our judgment and can have a significant impact on the determination of fair value. The nets assets of the Non-Residual Trusts have remained relatively consistent from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. Our mandatory call obligation associated with the Non-Residual Trusts will impact our liquidity in the future. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information.\nCharged-off Loans\nWe primarily utilize internal inputs, such as collection rates and discount rates, in the valuation of charged-off loans and also consider borrower specific factors such as FICO scores and bankruptcy status as well as underlying collateral. In addition, we take into account current and expected future economic conditions. Charged-off loans decreased from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 primarily due to collections during 2015.\nServicing Rights\nWe estimate the fair value of our servicing rights by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows utilizing assumptions that we believe a market participant would consider in valuing our servicing rights. The significant components of the estimated future cash flows for servicing rights include estimates and assumptions related to the prepayments of principal, defaults, ancillary fees, and discount rates that we believe approximate yields required by investors for these assets, and the expected cost of servicing. We reassess periodically and adjust the underlying inputs and assumptions in the model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market participant would consider in valuing servicing rights.\nWe use a discounted cash flow model for our servicing rights. This process allows us to determine inputs that are significant to the valuation and serves as a basis to forecast prepayment and default rates. These rates, which are used in the development of expected future cash flows, are based on historical observations of prepayment behavior in similar periods, comparing current and expected future mortgage rates to the mortgage rates of our servicing portfolio, and incorporates loan characteristics (e.g., loan type and note rate) and the relative sensitivity of our servicing portfolio to refinancing and also considers estimated levels of home equity. The fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industry surveys, recent market activity, actual portfolio experience, and when available, observable market data, and are adjusted as applicable based on this data.\nChanges in these assumptions are generally expected to affect our results of operations as follows:\nTable 260: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A declining interest rate environment generally drives increases in prepayment speeds. Increases in prepayments of principal reduce the value of our servicing rights as the underlying loans prepay faster, which causes accelerated servicing right amortization or declines in the fair value of servicing rights;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 261: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increases in defaults generally reduce the value of our servicing rights as the cost of servicing increases during the delinquency period due primarily to increases in servicing advances and related interest expense, which is partially offset by increases in ancillary fees; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 262: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increases in discount rate reduce the value of our servicing rights due to the lower overall net present value of the cash flows.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In contrast, decreases in prepayment speeds, defaults and discount rates generally increase the value of servicing rights.\nRefer to Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for the effect on the fair value of servicing rights carried at fair value for adverse changes to certain significant assumptions. Refer to the Servicing section within Business Segment Results for a discussion of the changes in servicing rights carried at fair value.\nInterest Rate Lock Commitments\nFair values of IRLCs are derived using valuation models incorporating market pricing for instruments with similar characteristics and by estimating the fair value of the servicing rights expected to be recorded at sale of the loan and are adjusted for anticipated loan funding probability. The loan funding probability ratio represents the aggregate likelihood that loans currently in a lock position will ultimately close, which is largely dependent on the loan processing stage that a loan is currently in, and changes in interest rates from the time of the rate lock through the time a loan is closed. The estimation process involved with the fair value of servicing rights is discussed above. Both the fair value of the servicing rights expected to be recorded at sale of the loan and the loan funding probability ratio are based on management judgment; these inputs can have a material effect on the estimated fair values.\nWe have derivative instruments that we hold to manage the price risk associated with IRLCs and loans held for sale. These derivatives and loans held for sale are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for additional information.\nServicing Rights Related Liabilities\nOur procedures for estimating the fair value servicing rights related liabilities are similar to those described above for servicing rights. The increase in servicing rights related liabilities at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 is primarily due to the sales of an excess servicing spread and servicing rights, partially offset by payments on the liabilities.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Advances\nWe establish an allowance for uncollectible advances that provides for probable losses inherent in funded servicer and protective advances. The allowance is based on a collection risk analysis that considers the underlying loan, the type of advance, our customers' servicing and advance reimbursement guidelines, reimbursement patterns and past loss experience. Although we examine a variety of available data to determine our allowance, our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance.\nOur allowance for uncollectible advances increased $7.9 million at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014. The allowance for uncollectible advances continued to grow during 2015 primarily due to increasing rejected claim filings, aging of rejected claims and increases in foreclosure legal costs. This increase was partially offset by the reduction to the allowance for the sale of our residual interests. We believe our allowance is sufficient to provide for probable losses based on internal reviews of the assumptions and methodology used; however, facts and circumstances may change which could cause the actual loss to exceed estimates.\nGoodwill\nAs a result of our various acquisitions, we have recorded goodwill, which represents the excess of the consideration paid for a business combination over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. We perform this annual test at the reporting unit level as of October 1 of each year, or whenever events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. Impairment exists when a reporting unit's carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. A reporting unit is a business segment or one level below. We have identified five reporting units, which constitute businesses: (i) Servicing; (ii) ARM; (iii) Insurance; (iv) Originations; and (v) Reverse Mortgage. Segment management regularly reviews discrete financial information for these reporting units.\nWe have the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for a potential impairment is necessary. Our qualitative assessment will use judgments including, but not limited to, changes in the general economic environment, industry and regulatory considerations, current economic performance compared to historical economic performance, entity-specific events, events affecting our reporting units, and sustained changes in our stock price, where applicable. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine, based upon our assessment of those qualitative factors that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its net carrying value, a quantitative assessment is required. The quantitative test is a two-step test. The first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. As part of the second step, we allocate the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, with any residual fair value allocated to goodwill (implied fair value of goodwill). If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of such goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess up to the carrying value of goodwill.\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit experienced operational challenges in its retail origination channel and experienced a reduction in opportunities for additional sub-servicing business. Additionally, more experience existed with respect to previously introduced product changes that deferred a significant amount of cash flow to future years. The initial impact of this deferral of cash flows to future years was greater than we had originally anticipated. Also during the second quarter of 2015, new financial assessment requirements for the HECM program went into effect and new mortgagee letters were issued that could impact the likelihood of curtailment events in future periods. At such time, the impact of these more recent changes remained uncertain. At the same time, the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit continued to experience increasing liquidity requirements for the repurchase of certain HECMs and real estate owned from Ginnie Mae securitization pools, and based on recent developments, an increase in obligations surrounding curtailment-related items existing at the time of the RMS acquisition. Collectively, the impact of the greater than anticipated principal deferral, the operational challenges and the liquidity requirements resulted in reduced and delayed cash flows in the reverse mortgage business.\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, we revised our multi-year forecast for the reverse mortgage business. The change in assumptions used in the revised forecast and the fair value estimates utilized in the impairment testing of the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit goodwill incorporated lower projected revenue as a result of the factors noted above. The revised forecast also reflected changes related to current market trends and other expectations about the anticipated operating results of the reverse mortgage business.\nBased on these factors, we determined that there were interim impairment indicators that led to the need for a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill purposes during the second quarter.\nBased on the step one analysis, we concluded that the fair value of the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit (determined based on the income approach) was below its carrying value and were therefore required to perform a step two analysis to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. We concluded, based on the step two analysis, that the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeded its implied fair value and as a result, recorded a $56.5 million goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of 2015.\nStep 1 Annual Testing\nSimilar to 2014, our share price continued to experience volatility during 2015. As a result, we reassessed our market capitalization and the implications that the decline in market capitalization had on the carrying value of our goodwill. Management concluded that there were circumstances evident which indicated the fair value of our reporting units could be below their carrying amounts. As a result of the Step 1 testing, the Originations and ARM reporting units had fair values which exceeded their carrying values of 52% and 5%, respectively. However, the Servicing reporting unit had a carrying value which exceeded its fair value and therefore, we were required to complete the second step of the impairment evaluation for this reporting unit. Based on the step two analysis, the carrying amount of the Servicing reporting unit's goodwill exceeded its implied fair value and as a result, we recorded a $151.0 million goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2015. This impairment was primarily the result of higher discount rates applied to forecasted cash flows driven by the decline in our stock price, which has been impacted by continued challenges in our industry, market developments, as well as the impact these factors have had on certain Company specific matters. At December 31, 2015, the Servicing, Originations and ARM reporting units had goodwill of $281.2 million, $47.7 million and $34.5 million, respectively.\nWe are likely to continue to be impacted in the near term by overall market performance within the sector, a continued level of regulatory scrutiny and other Company specific matters. As a result, we have and will continue to regularly monitor, among other things, our market capitalization, overall economic and sector conditions and other events or circumstances, including the ability to develop new business opportunities within the ARM reporting unit that may result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.\nContingencies\nWe estimate contingent liabilities based on management's evaluation of the probability of outcomes and the ability to estimate the range of exposure. A liability is contingent if the extent of loss is not presently known but may become known in the future through the occurrence of some uncertain future event. Accounting standards require that a liability be recorded if it is determined that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In deriving an estimate, we are required to make assumptions about matters that are, by their nature, highly uncertain. The assessment of contingent liabilities, including legal contingencies, curtailment obligations and repurchase obligations, involves the use of critical estimates, assumptions and judgments. Through our assessment we consider many factors, including the progress of the matter, prior experience and experience of others in similar matters, available defenses, and the advice of legal counsel and other experts. Our estimates are based on the belief that future events will validate the current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of these exposures. Because matters may be resolved over long periods of time, accruals are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. However, there can be no assurance that future events will not differ from our assessments.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards and their related effects or anticipated effects on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nGlossary of Terms\nThis Glossary of Terms includes acronyms and defined terms that are used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 263: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2011 First Lien Term Loan\n</td> <td>$500 million first lien senior secured term loan facility entered into on July 1, 2011\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 264: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2011 Plan\n</td> <td>2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan established by the Company on May 10, 2011\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 265: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2011 Second Lien Term Loan\n</td> <td>$265 million second lien senior secured term loan facility entered into on July 1, 2011\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 266: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2012 Common Stock Offering\n</td> <td>Registered underwritten public offering of 6,900,000 shares of the Company's common stock completed on October 23, 2012\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 267: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2012 Revolver\n</td> <td>$125 million senior secured revolving credit facility entered into on November 28, 2012\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 268: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2012 Term Loan\n</td> <td>$700 million senior term loan facility entered into on November 28, 2012\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 269: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013 Credit Agreement\n</td> <td>Credit agreement entered into on December 19, 2013 among the Company, Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent and collateral agent, the lenders from time to time party thereto and other parties thereto\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 270: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013 Revolver\n</td> <td>$125 million senior secured revolving credit facility entered into on December 19, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 271: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013 Secured Credit Facilities\n</td> <td>2013 Term Loan and 2013 Revolver, collectively\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 272: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013 Term Loan\n</td> <td>$1.5 billion senior secured first lien term loan entered into on December 19, 2013\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 273: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a non-GAAP financial measure, refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures section under Item 7.

charges during 2015 and 2014. The goodwill evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2015 indicated the estimated implied fair value of the Servicing reporting unit's goodwill at the evaluation date was less than its book value, therefore requiring an impairment charge of $151.0 million. The goodwill evaluations performed in the second quarters of 2015 and 2014 indicated the estimated implied fair value of the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit's goodwill at each evaluation date was less than its book value, therefore requiring impairment charges of $56.5 million and $82.3 million, respectively. As a result of these goodwill impairment charges, the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit no longer has goodwill. Refer to Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for further discussion.\n (1) Realized gains (losses) on freestanding derivatives were $(67.0) million, $(134.8) million and $87.7 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  The decrease in net gains on sales of loans in 2015 and 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year periods was primarily due to a shift in volume from the higher margin retention channel to the lower margin correspondent channel, offset partially by a higher volume of locked loans in each respective period. The higher volume of locked loans during 2015 as compared to 2014 was largely due to lower average interest rates in 2015, while the higher volume of locked loans in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due to having a full twelve months of activity in 2014 as opposed to a condensed period in 2013. Additionally, we had higher capitalized servicing rights during 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to a higher volume of loans sold as well as a change in mix from substantially all Fannie Mae in 2014 to approximately 35% Ginnie Mae, which have a higher servicing fee than GSE loans, and 65% Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in 2015. The condensed period in 2013 results from the acquisition of the capital markets and originations platforms from ResCap on January 31, 2013 and the correspondent lending business from Ally Bank on March 1, 2013. These acquisitions initiated the ramp up of our mortgage loan originations business.\nTotal other gains increased $6.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to an $11.8 million gain recognized on the sale of an investment which was accounted for using the equity method; a $4.7 million net gain on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of Senior Notes and the voluntary prepayment on the 2013 Term Loan; and a $3.1 million gain for consideration received for the contribution of Marix to WCO. These gains were partially offset by $12.8 million in lower net fair value gains on the assets and liabilities of the Non-Residual Trusts as 2014 included the impact of changes in assumptions related to the reduction of discount rates resulting from tightening of yields in the market.\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

which generally focus on conventional mortgages with low delinquency rates. This allowed for low-cost, routine payment processing and required minimal consumer interaction. Following the credit crisis, the need for high-touch\u201d specialty servicers, such as Ditech Financial, increased as loan performance declined, delinquencies rose and servicing complexities broadened.\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity/Expiration\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$1.5 billion 2013 Term Loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR plus 3.75%\nLIBOR floor of 1.00%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00% per annum beginning 1st quarter of 2014; remainder at final maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 18, 2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$125.0 million 2013 Revolver\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR plus 3.75%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Bullet payment at maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 19, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther revenues consists primarily of asset management performance fees, the change in fair value of charged-off loans, income associated with our beneficial interest in a servicing asset, and origination fee income. Other revenues decreased $1.6 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to $36.8 million in asset management performance fees collected and earned by our Other non-reportable segment in connection with the investment management of a fund during 2014 and $7.5 million in lower income from our beneficial interest in a servicing asset. The performance fees were earned in connection with the liquidation of the fund's investments during 2014 and are based on the fund exceeding pre-defined thresholds. These fees are recorded when the fund is terminated or when the likelihood of claw-back is improbable. The decrease in these revenues was partially offset by $19.3 million in higher fair value gains relating to charged-off loans as a result of twelve months of collection activity in 2015 compared to eight months in 2014 and an increase in expected collections; $17.7 million in higher origination fee income resulting from the refinancing of mortgage loans partially offset by lower fees charged to new reverse loan borrowers; and $6.2 million in higher other interest income. Origination fee income was $40.6 million and $22.9 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number\nof Accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unpaid Principal\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted- Average\nContractual Servicing Fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30 Days or\nMore Past Due (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party servicing portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First lien mortgages\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,676,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,637,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.09\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien mortgages\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,823,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.46\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufactured housing and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>231,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,663,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.09\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total accounts serviced for third parties (2) (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,087,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>244,124,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>On-balance sheet residential loans and real estate owned (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,439,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total mortgage loan servicing portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,124,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>246,564,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.85\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\n (3) Master repurchase agreements are held by the Originations and Reverse Mortgage segments. \nIn November 2015, we completed the sale of servicing rights, with an unpaid principal balance of $1.8 billion, to WCO for a sales price of $17.8 million. We recognized the proceeds from the sale of the servicing rights as a financing arrangement. We elected to record the servicing rights financing at fair value similar to the related servicing rights. The repayment of such financing is based on future servicing fees received from the residential loans underlying the servicing rights. At December 31, 2015, the carrying value of our servicing rights financing and the related servicing rights was $16.9 million. We have a receivable due from WCO for this sale of $8.9 million at December 31, 2015. In November 2015, we also entered into a sub-servicing arrangement with WCO pursuant to which we will sub-service the residential loans underlying such servicing rights in exchange for a sub-servicing

These financing transactions resulted in a higher average balance of our corporate debt, but a lower average interest rate as compared to 2013. In addition, interest expense increased as a result of a higher average balance of servicing advance liabilities, which are utilized to finance servicer and protective advances, due to our growing servicing business. These increases were partially offset by decreases in interest expense related to mortgage-backed debt and master repurchase agreements. Interest expense related to mortgage-backed debt decreased as a result of a lower average outstanding balance as the portfolio continues to run off. Interest expense related to master repurchase agreements decreased primarily as a result of a lower average interest rate. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for additional information on our debt.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had repurchased 2,382,733 shares of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase plan at an aggregate cost of $28.1 million, or an average cost of $11.78 per share.

The unpaid principal balance of our third-party servicing portfolio increased $9.2 billion at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 primarily due to our originations sales with servicing retained and servicing and sub-servicing portfolio acquisitions, partially offset by runoff of the portfolio. Sub-servicing portfolio acquisitions include new sub-servicing performed for WCO. The decrease in the unpaid principal balance of our on-balance sheet residential loans and real estate owned of $735.5 million can be attributed to the sale of our residual interests, which resulted in the deconsolidation of the related loans, combined with the overall portfolio runoff of the assets held by the Residual and Non-Residual Trusts, partially offset by an increase in mortgage loans held for sale of $213.8 million. The unpaid principal balance of loans associated with the sale of the seven Residual Trusts is included in our third-party servicing portfolio at December 31, 2015 since we continue to service these

The portfolio disappearance rate, consisting of contractual payments, voluntary prepayments and defaults, of the total mortgage loan portfolio, was 14.23% in 2015.\nThrough RMS's warehouse facilities under master repurchase agreements we finance the origination or purchase of reverse loans and repurchases of certain HECMs and real estate owned from Ginnie Mae securitization pools. At December 31, 2015, we had a facility with a capacity of $125.0 million that could be used to originate or purchase reverse loans and another facility with a capacity of $100.0 million that could be used to repurchase HECMs and real estate owned from Ginnie Mae securitization pools. The interest rates on the facilities are primarily based on LIBOR plus between 2.50% and 3.13% and have expiration dates through October 2016. These facilities are secured by the underlying asset and provide creditors a security interest in the assets that meet the eligibility requirements under the terms of the particular facility. We agree to repay the borrowings under these facilities within a specified timeframe, and the source of repayment is typically from proceeds received on the securitization of the underlying reverse loans, claim proceeds received from HUD or liquidation proceeds from the sale of real estate owned. We evaluate our needs under these facilities based on forecasted reverse loan origination volume and repurchases; however, there can be no assurance that these facilities will be available to us in the future. At December 31, 2015, $175.0 million of the aggregate capacity has been provided on an uncommitted basis, and as such, to the extent these funds are requested to purchase or originate reverse loans or repurchase HECMs and real estate owned from Ginnie Mae securitization pools, the counterparties have no obligation to fulfill such request. All obligations of RMS under the master repurchase agreements are guaranteed by the Parent Company. We had $122.3 million of borrowings under these master repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015 which included $87.4 million of borrowings relating to repurchases of HECMs and real estate owned.\nIn conjunction with our originations business, we provide representations and warranties on loan sales. We sell substantially all of our originated or purchased mortgage loans into the secondary market for securitization or to private investors as whole loans. We sell conventional conforming and government-backed mortgage loans through GSE and agency-sponsored securitizations in which mortgage-backed securities are created and sold to third-party investors. We also sell non-conforming mortgage loans to private investors. In doing so, representations and warranties regarding certain attributes of the loans are made to the third-party investor. Subsequent to the sale, if it is determined that a loan sold is in breach of these representations or warranties, we generally have an obligation to cure such breach. In general, if we are unable to cure such breach, the purchaser of the loan may require us to repurchase such loan for the unpaid principal balance, accrued interest, and related advances, and in any event, we must indemnify such purchaser for certain losses and expenses incurred by such purchaser in connection with such breach. Our credit loss may be reduced by any recourse we have to correspondent lenders that, in turn, have sold such residential loans to us and breached similar or other representations and warranties.\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funded volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,418,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,457,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,897,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,498\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,440,457\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securitized volume (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,465,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,480,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,882,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,342\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,402,259\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $34.9 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due to hiring to support the growth of our business, including the hiring of EverBank employees in 2014. Headcount assigned directly to our Servicing segment increased by approximately 500 full-time employees from 3,700 at December 31, 2013 to 4,200 at December 31, 2014.\nIn conjunction with our exit from the Originations segment's consumer retail channel in January 2016, we continued our expense reduction efforts and further reorganized Ditech Financial in an attempt to improve our efficiency. One-time costs associated with the measures taken in January 2016 are estimated to be approximately $5 million. The consumer retail channel incurred a direct margin loss of approximately $11 million in 2015. In addition to the elimination of this loss in future annual periods, the January 2016 reorganization activities are expected to result in additional annual cost savings of approximately $17 million. Further, as part of our ongoing technology improvement and customer experience enhancement initiatives, we commenced a project in February 2016 to review many of our operating processes. We expect to complete our initial review of such processes in the second quarter of 2016 and plan to move forward with implementation of identified action items thereafter.\nMortgage Loan Servicing Business\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 -

Facilities are summarized in the table below:\nGeneral and administrative and allocated indirect expenses increased $15.0 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to a $10.2 million increase in expenses related to regulatory developments in 2015 which led to additional charges around curtailable events and to accrual adjustments associated with legal and regulatory matters outside of the normal course of business. In addition, there was a $6.8 million increase in curtailment due primarily to an increase in missed timelines driven by an increase in volume resulting from the contraction of default servicing timeframes due to recent regulatory changes and an increase in the related exposure to incurred but not known deaths of the mortgagor and the mortgagor's vacancy from their principal residence. Further there was a $2.8 million increase in advertising and a $6.9 million net increase in various miscellaneous expenses including real estate owned management support services, equipment maintenance and occupancy expenses. These higher charges were partially offset by $8.2 million in lower provisions on uncollectible receivables and advances resulting from improved collections and recent historical experience, as well as transaction costs of $3.5 million recorded in 2014 related to an unsuccessful acquisition, with no similar charge in 2015.\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number\nof Accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unpaid Principal\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted- Average\nContractual Servicing Fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30 Days or\nMore Past Due (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party servicing portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First lien mortgages\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,648,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220,011,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien mortgages\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,277,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufactured housing and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,616,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.43\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total accounts serviced for third parties (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,142,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234,905,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>On-balance sheet residential loans and real estate owned (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,175,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total mortgage loan servicing portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,199,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238,081,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA decreased $98.1 million and $100.9 million, respectively, in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to reduced net gains on sales of loans.

significant shift in the servicing landscape since the housing downturn in 2008, as specialty servicers either sub-serviced or acquired portfolios that money-center banks and others have sought to divest. While the five largest bank servicers once commanded a nearly 60% market share of the servicing sector, their share had declined to approximately 37% at December 31, 2015. Over the next several years we expect banking organizations will continue to seek to transfer servicing to specialty servicers as they focus on their core client base and shift servicing for non-core clients and credit-sensitive loans and comply with recent changes in banking organization capital rules.\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average unpaid principal balance of loans serviced (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244,736,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>227,589,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189,365,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,146,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,223,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average servicing fee (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.01\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Average balance is calculated as the average recorded investment in the loans at the beginning of each month during the year.

Upon the occurrence of an event of default, specified percentages of noteholders have the right to terminate all commitments and accelerate the notes under the base indenture, enforce their rights with respect to the collateral and take certain other actions. The events of default include, among other events, the occurrence of any failure to make payments (subject to certain cure periods and including balances due after the occurrence of a target amortization event), failure of Ditech Financial to satisfy various deposit and remittance obligations as servicer of certain mortgage loans, the requirement of a subsidiary, Green Tree Agency Advance Funding Trust I, to be registered as an investment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, certain tests related to the collection and performance of the receivables securing the notes issued pursuant to the base indenture and applicable indenture supplement, removal of Ditech Financial's status as an approved seller or servicer by either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and bankruptcy events.\nTotal expenses for 2015 were $1.7 billion, which represented an increase of $86.7 million, or 5%, as compared to 2014. We incurred $56.5 million and $82.3 million in impairment charges in the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $151.0 million in impairment charges in our Servicing reporting unit during the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result of the goodwill impairment charges in the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit, this reporting unit no longer has goodwill. In addition, we had $33.5 million in lower interest expense related to mortgage-backed debt primarily due to the aforementioned sale of our residual interest in seven of the Residual Trusts.\nResults of Operations -

In addition, we had a larger reduction in 2014 to our estimate of the liability associated with our representations and warranties for sales of mortgage loans due to the prior year including a reduction to our reserves as a result of timely payment history on loans originated under HARP and lower actual origination defects as compared to original expectations. Under HARP, after one year of timely payments by the borrower since the origination of the loan, our exposure to the liability associated with representations and warranties becomes limited in nature. In the prior year, we had more loans completing one year of timely payments and such loans had higher initial reserves established due to a higher initial estimate of defects. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower occupancy, printing and mailing costs in support of cost savings measures.\n\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Servicing rights at fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,682,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,599,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,131,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>468,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unpaid principal balance of accounts serviced\n</td> <td>183,506,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,832,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,123,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,673,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,709,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inputs and assumptions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average remaining life in years\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average stated borrower interest rate on underlying collateral\n</td> <td>4.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.34\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.55\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average discount rate\n</td> <td>10.88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.33\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.21\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conditional prepayment rate\n</td> <td>9.94\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.87\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.07\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.81\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conditional default rate\n</td> <td>1.06\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.30\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.54\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvided below is a summary of results of operations, Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA for our Servicing segment (dollars in thousands):\nWe incurred $56.5 million and $82.3 million in impairment charges during 2015 and 2014 as a result of goodwill evaluations performed in the second quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively.

rights carried at fair value resulting primarily from market-driven changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds. \nAll of our master repurchase agreements contain customary events of default and covenants, the most significant of which are financial covenants. Financial covenants that are most sensitive to the operating results and resulting financial position are minimum tangible net worth requirements, indebtedness to tangible net worth ratio requirements, and minimum liquidity and profitability requirements. RMS was in compliance with its financial covenants relating to master repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015.\nOther gains of $21.0 million for 2015 include an $11.8 million gain recognized on the sale of an investment which was accounted for using the equity method; an $8.9 million realized gain recognized on the sale of a trading security; a $3.1 million gain for consideration received for the contribution of Marix; and a $2.8 million loss recognized on the sale of our residual interests. In 2015, we received and subsequently sold a trading security as consideration for the sale of the excess servicing spread associated with certain servicing rights.\nReverse Mortgage - Our Reverse Mortgage segment consists of operations that purchase and originate HECMs that are securitized, but remain on the consolidated balance sheet as collateral for secured borrowings. This segment performs servicing for third-party credit owners and the Company and provides other complementary services for the reverse mortgage market, such as real estate owned property management and disposition.\n \u2022 Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect non-cash compensation which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package; \nNet Servicing Revenue and Fees\n__________\nInterest Expense\n (2) Represents the provision for curtailment expense, net of expected third-party recoveries, related to historical practices at RMS which have led to increasing exposure for historical periods as regulatory requirements are clarified. Current practices have been revised in order to minimize current and future exposure to curtailable events. Our non-GAAP measures are not adjusted for accruals for current period curtailable events as such accruals are considered part of ongoing operating results of the business. \n (5) Average balance for mortgage-backed debt is calculated as the average carrying value at the beginning of each month during the year.  Goodwill Impairment\nOur servicing rights carried at fair value primarily consist of servicing rights acquired since January 1, 2013. The gain resulting from changes in valuation inputs or other assumptions of $153.3 million during 2013 was due primarily to overall reductions to assumed conditional prepayment rates and conditional default rates since the acquisitions of the related servicing rights. The decline in assumed conditional prepayment rates resulted primarily from a higher interest rate environment, which was partially offset by the impact of HARP being extended in April 2013 through December 2015 and the increase in the FHFA's housing price index. The decline in assumed conditional default rates was due primarily to actual performance and the addition of lower delinquency loans to our servicing portfolio. Assumed discount rates remained relatively flat since the acquisitions of servicing rights during 2013. The extension of HAMP in May 2013 to December 2015 also contributed to the change in valuation inputs and other assumptions given expected growth in incentive fees.\nIncentives relating to the performance of certain loan pools serviced by us decreased $9.1 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. Asset recovery income decreased by $5.1 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 as a result of lower gross collections due primarily to the runoff of the related loans managed by the Servicing segment. Modification fees and fees earned under HAMP increased $8.8 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due to a higher volume of completed modifications as well as successful maintenance of the modified loans under performing status.\nFollowing the housing downturn in 2008, national originations volume peaked in 2012 at more than $2.0 trillion, declining to approximately $1.8 trillion in 2013 and $1.3 trillion in 2014. However, the low interest rate environment in 2015 contributed to an estimated $1.7 trillion in originations in 2015. The 30-year conventional mortgage rate averaged approximately 3.85%, 4.17% and 3.98% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Conversely, in December 2015 the Federal Reserve announced its first increase in interest rates since 2006. As of February 19, 2016, our expectations based on market data are for mortgage originations to decrease approximately 10% to $1.5 trillion in 2016 as declining refinance volume more than offsets increasing home purchase volume. Based on such data, we believe refinance volumes may drop approximately 30% in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by rising interest rates, after increasing approximately 50% in 2015 compared to 2014. While the volume of originations tends to decline in a rising interest rate environment, the value of our servicing rights tend to rise as prepayments decrease.\n\nOther Revenues\n__________\nThe volume of our originations activity and changes in market rates primarily govern the fluctuations in revenues and expenses of our Originations segment. Provided below are summaries of our originations volume by channel (in thousands):\nDuring 2015, we added to the unpaid principal balance of our third-party mortgage loan servicing portfolio: $21.3 billion relating to acquired servicing rights, $7.3 billion relating to sub-servicing contracts and $18.6 billion relating to servicing rights capitalized upon sales of mortgage loans, while also adding $2.7 billion of unpaid principal balance to our third-party reverse loan servicing portfolio. Our third-party mortgage loan and reverse loan servicing portfolio was reduced by $39.5 billion of unpaid principal balance in payoffs and sales, net of recapture activities, during 2015. Also in 2015, we originated and purchased $1.4 billion in reverse mortgage volume and issued $1.5 billion in HMBS.\nThe decline in direct margin in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to a shift in volume from the higher margin retention channel to the lower margin correspondent channel and lower origination fees in 2014. In addition, 2014 includes the impact of lower direct expenses resulting from economies of scale and cost cutting initiatives established to align activities with the scope and scale of operations at such time.\nConvertible Notes\nWe recorded fair value losses on our servicing rights carried at fair value primarily as a result of higher discount rates used to value our servicing rights and higher realization of expected cash flows. We had lower interest income on loans primarily due to the sale of our residual interest in seven of the Residual Trusts in the second quarter of 2015. We had lower net fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations primarily due to the widening of spreads resulting from changes in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS and a lower reduction of LIBOR in 2015 as compared to 2014, offset partially by an increase in cash generated by origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs. We had lower net gains on sales of loans due primarily to a shift in volume from the higher margin retention channel to the lower margin correspondent channel, even though average interest rates were lower during 2015 as compared to 2014 and these lower rates gave rise to a higher total volume of locked loans.\nSalaries and benefits expense decreased $23.5 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a lower average headcount as a result of restructuring measures within our mortgage loan servicing operations, offset in part by severance incurred in relation to this restructuring. Headcount assigned directly to our Servicing segment decreased by approximately 600 full-time employees from 4,200 at December 31, 2014 to 3,600 at December 31, 2015.\nServicing fees increased $31.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to growth in the third-party servicing portfolio resulting from portfolio acquisitions and servicing rights capitalized as a result of our loan origination activities, partially offset by runoff of the servicing portfolio. Additionally there was a $13.1 million benefit recognized during 2014 from the settlement of differences in views between a prior servicer and the Company on how certain fees were recognized under a contract that was not recognized during the current year. Average loans serviced increased by $17.1 billion, or 8%, in 2015 as compared to 2014.\n\nSimilar to our mortgage loan servicing business, our reverse mortgage servicing agreements impose on us obligations to advance our own funds to meet contractual payment requirements for customers and credit owners and to pay protective advances, which are required to preserve the collateral underlying the residential loans being serviced. We rely upon operating cash flows to fund these obligations.\n\nRepresentations and Warranties\nHMBS Issuer Obligations\nProvided below is a summary of the average balances of residential loans carried at amortized cost and the related interest income and average yields (dollars in thousands):\nSimilar to 2014, the Company's share price continued to experience volatility during 2015. As a result, the Company reassessed its market capitalization and the implications that the decline in market capitalization had on the carrying value of its goodwill. Our October 1, 2015 analysis indicated that the carrying amount of our Servicing reporting unit's goodwill exceeded its implied fair value and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $151.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This impairment was primarily the result of higher discount rates applied to forecasted cash flows driven by the decline in our stock price, which has been impacted by continued challenges in our industry, market developments, as well as the impact these factors have had on certain Company specific matters. Refer to Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for further discussion regarding goodwill impairment.\nPrior to May 1, 2019, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon specified events and during specified periods, and, on or after May 1, 2019, at any time. The Convertible Notes will initially be convertible at a conversion rate of 17.0068 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $58.80 per share. Upon conversion, we may pay or deliver, at our option, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. It is our intent to settle all conversions through combination settlement, which involves payment of an amount of cash equal to the principal amount and any excess of conversion value over the principal amount in shares of common stock.\nWe incur interest expense on our corporate debt, mortgage-backed debt issued by the Residual Trusts, master repurchase agreements and servicing advance liabilities, all of which are accounted for at amortized cost. Interest expense decreased $29.5 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to decreases in interest expense related to mortgage-backed debt and servicing advance liabilities, partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to master repurchase agreements. Interest expense related to mortgage-backed debt decreased primarily as a result of the sale of our residual interests, which required the deconsolidation of the related mortgage-backed debt, and the runoff of the overall related mortgage loan portfolio. Interest expense related to servicing advance liabilities decreased due primarily to a lower average interest rate, offset partially by a higher average balance outstanding. Interest expense related to master repurchase agreements, which are utilized to fund purchases and originations of mortgage loans and reverse loans, increased primarily as a result of a higher average outstanding balance, which is due largely to a higher volume of mortgage loan fundings, partially offset by a lower average interest rate.\n (5) Includes the impact of the sale of servicing rights associated with 4,551 accounts and $968.4 million in unpaid principal balance during 2014. \nShare Repurchase Plan\nYear Ended December 31, 2015\nOur Industry and Operating Environment\n (3) Includes interest expense on servicing rights related liabilities, which represents the accretion of fair value, of $9.3 million and $4.9 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively.  2015 Compared to 2014\nA summary of net servicing revenue and fees for our Servicing segment is provided below (dollars in thousands):\n (1) Third-party servicing includes servicing rights capitalized, sub-servicing rights capitalized and sub-servicing rights not capitalized. Sub-servicing rights capitalized consist of contracts acquired through business combinations whereby the benefits from the contract are greater than adequate compensation for performing the servicing. Refer to Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nNet fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations include the contractual interest income earned on reverse loans, including those not yet securitized or bought out of securitization pools, net of interest expense on HMBS related obligations, and the change in fair value of these assets and liabilities. Refer to the Reverse Mortgage segment discussion under our Business Segment Results section below for additional information including a detailed breakout of the components of net fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations.\nRollforwards of reverse loan and real estate owned repurchase activity (by unpaid principal balance) are included below (in thousands):\nDuring 2015, we recognized a $4.7 million net gain on extinguishment of debt. We recognized a gain of $5.7 million related to the repurchase of Senior Notes with a carrying value of $35.7 million and an unpaid principal balance of $36.3 million for $30.0 million and a loss of $1.0 million related to the write-off of issue costs resulting from the voluntary payment of $50.0 million on the 2013 Term Loan.\nAn amount of up to $25.0 million under the 2013 Revolver is available to be used for the issuance of LOCs. Any amounts outstanding in issued LOCs reduce availability for cash borrowings under the 2013 Revolver. There have been no borrowings under the 2013 Revolver. At December 31, 2015, we had $0.3 million outstanding in an issued LOC with remaining availability under the 2013 Revolver of $124.7 million. The commitment fee on the unused portion of the 2013 Revolver is 0.50% per annum. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we made a voluntary payment of $50.0 million on our 2013 Term Loan that resulted in a loss on extinguishment of $1.0 million due to the write-off of the related issue costs. The loss on extinguishment is recorded in gains (losses) on extinguishments on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The balance outstanding on the 2013 Term Loan was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2015.\nOther revenues for our Other non-reportable segment consists primarily of asset management performance fees, and to a lesser extent, asset management advisory fees and other interest income. Other revenues decreased $35.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to $36.8 million in asset management performance fees collected and earned in connection with the asset management of a fund during 2014, partially offset by the settlement of a receivable that was repaid in conjunction with the sale of an investment accounted for using the equity method during 2015.\n (4) Represents the non-cash fair value adjustment to arrive at cash generated from reverse mortgage origination activities. \nTotal revenues for 2015 were $1.3 billion, which represented a decline of $212.9 million, or 14%, as compared to 2014. The decrease in revenue reflects a $107.2 million decrease in net servicing revenue and fees, primarily driven by $128.5 million in higher fair value losses on servicing rights; $60.2 million in lower interest income on loans; $11.7 million in lower net fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations; and $8.3 million in lower net gains on sales of loans.\nNet Gains on Sales of Loans\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included the benefit of higher margins from HARP, which is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2016. HARP is a federal program of the U.S. which helps homeowners refinance their mortgage. Our strategy includes significant efforts to maintain retention volumes through traditional refinancing opportunities and HARP, although we believe peak HARP refinancing already occurred in prior periods.\nProvided below are summaries of our funded volume, which represents purchases and originations of reverse loans, and volume of securitizations into HMBS (dollars in thousands):\n (3) Represents estimated settlement amounts for certain legal and regulatory matters outside of the normal course of business as well as legal costs and expenses associated with these matters. \nExecutive Summary\nOther revenues increased $27.9 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to $22.5 million in higher fair value gains relating to charged-off loans that were purchased during 2014 and $4.5 million in higher beneficial interest income related to a servicing asset.\nAs an HMBS issuer, we assume certain obligations related to each security issued. The most significant obligation is the requirement to purchase loans out of the Ginnie Mae securitization pools once the outstanding principal balance of the related HECM is equal to or greater than 98% of the maximum claim amount. Performing repurchased loans are conveyed to HUD and payment is received from HUD typically within 30 days of repurchase. Non-performing repurchased loans are generally liquidated through foreclosure and subsequent sale of real estate owned. Loans are considered non-performing upon events such as, but not limited to, the death of the mortgagor, the mortgagor no longer occupying the property as their principal residence, or the property taxes or insurance not being paid. We rely upon certain master repurchase agreements and operating cash flows, to the extent necessary, to repurchase loans. The timing and amount of our obligation to repurchase HECMs is uncertain as repurchase is predicated on certain factors such as whether or not a borrower event of default occurs prior to the HECM reaching the mandatory repurchase threshold under which we are obligated to repurchase the loan.\n\nHMBS related obligations increased $695.5 million due primarily to the securitization of reverse loans, partially offset by the repurchase of certain HECMs and real estate owned from securitization pools.\n__________\n\nProvided below is a summary of our Servicing segment's margin (in basis points):\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to (i) net income (loss) or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP or (ii) operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations of these metrics are:\nWe manage our Company in three reportable segments: Servicing, Originations, and Reverse Mortgage. A description of the business conducted by each of these segments is provided below:\nIntersegment Retention Revenue\nInterest Expense\nDeferred tax asset, net of $108.1 million in 2015 changed by $194.7 million from a deferred tax liability, net of $86.6 million in 2014. The change in deferred taxes was primarily a result of the current year operating loss, which increased the net operating loss carryforwards; the tax impact of the sale of our residual interests; differences in tax and GAAP bases and recovery methods for servicing rights; the sales of excess servicing spreads and servicing rights during the year; and an increase in the curtailment liability primarily related to the reverse mortgage business. These items were partially offset by decreases in accrued expenses related to legal and regulatory matters and tax amortization of deductible goodwill.\nWe funded the residential loan portfolio in the consolidated Residual Trusts through the securitization market. We record on our consolidated balance sheets the assets and liabilities, including mortgage-backed debt, of the Non-Residual Trusts as a result of certain obligations to exercise mandatory clean-up calls for each of these trusts at their earliest exercisable dates. The mortgage-backed debt issued by the Residual Trusts is accounted for at amortized cost. The mortgage-backed debt of the Non-Residual Trusts is accounted for at fair value. The total unpaid principal balance of mortgage-backed debt was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2015.\nOperational Efficiency\n__________\nThe change of $168.4 million from income tax expense in 2013 to an income tax benefit in 2014 was due primarily to the change from income before income taxes in 2013 to a loss before income taxes in 2014, offset by the impact on income taxes for non-deductible expenses such as the goodwill impairment. In addition, during 2014 we released $3.6 million from the aforementioned liability for unrecognized tax benefits associated with state and local taxes.\nSalaries and Benefits\nOther revenues, which consists primarily of origination fee income and interest on cash equivalents, increased $25.7 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, and decreased $16.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily as a result of lower origination fees in 2014 due to our having waived certain fees charged to borrowers refinancing mortgage loans.\nTotal revenues for 2014 were $1.5 billion, which represented a decline of $315.3 million, or 17%, as compared to 2013. The decrease in revenue reflects a $181.9 million decrease in net servicing revenue and fees, primarily driven by a $321.6 million decrease related to the change in fair value of servicing rights, partially offset by increased gross servicing revenue and fees of $143.0 million resulting from the growth in our servicing portfolio; a decrease of $136.8 million in net gains on sales of loans; and lower net fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations of $10.4 million. Other revenues increased $37.3 million due primarily to $36.8 million in performance fees earned by our investment management business in 2014.\n (1) Corporate debt includes our 2013 Term Loan, Senior Notes, and Convertible Notes. Corporate debt activities are included in the Other non-reportable segment. \nThe 2013 Secured Credit Facilities contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase our capital stock, make certain types of investments, create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries, incur certain liens, sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all of our assets to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The 2013 Secured Credit Facilities also contain customary events of default, including the failure to make timely payments on the 2013 Term Loan and 2013 Revolver or other material indebtedness, the failure to satisfy certain covenants and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency. We were in compliance with all covenants contained in our 2013 Secured Credit Facilities at December 31, 2015.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our business segments and funds available from our 2013 Revolver, master repurchase agreements, mortgage loan servicing advance facilities, issuance of HMBS and excess servicing spread financing arrangements. We may generate additional liquidity through sales of MSRs, any portion thereof, or other assets.\nTotal expenses for our Other non-reportable segment increased $10.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to higher salaries and benefits expense relating to increases in share-based compensation expense due largely to a higher number of awards granted and bonuses.\nWe are party to a servicer advance financing facility that provides funding for servicer and protective advances made by Ditech Financial in connection with its servicing of certain Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage loans. On October 21, 2015, this facility was amended and restated to provide for the issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of term notes consisting of Series 2015-T1 one-year term notes with an initial aggregate principal balance of $360.0 million and Series 2015-T2 three-year term notes with an initial aggregate principal balance of $140.0 million; to extend the commitment for up to $600.0 million of previously issued Series 2014-VF2 variable funding notes until October 2016; and to reduce total borrowing capacity under this facility by $100.0 million to $1.1 billion in the aggregate. The proceeds from the issuance of the Series 2015-T1 term notes and the Series 2015-T2 term notes were used to reduce the outstanding principal balance of the Series 2014-VF2 variable funding notes and to pay certain transaction fees, costs and expenses.\nInsurance Revenue\nExcess Servicing Spread Liabilities\nInsurance revenue consists of commission income and fees earned on voluntary and lender-placed insurance policies issued and other products sold to borrowers, net of estimated future policy cancellations. Commission income is based on a percentage of the premium of the insurance policy issued, which varies based on the type of policy. Insurance revenue decreased $23.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $13.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to a decrease in commissions earned related to lender-placed insurance policies resulting from regulatory changes and runoff of existing policies. Due to changes in GSE requirements and regulations that limited our ability to charge commissions for lender-placed insurance policies, our sales commissions related to lender-placed insurance policies began to decrease in June 2014. During 2014, these lower commissions were partially offset by commissions earned from an increase in lender-placed insurance policies issued prior to the effective date of the regulatory changes related to 2013 and early 2014 bulk servicing right acquisitions. In addition, in September 2015 we entered into an agreement to settle a litigation matter pursuant to which we have agreed not to receive commissions as a result of the placement of certain lender-placed insurance policies. We believe we have accrued the full amount expected to be paid under the settlement agreement at December 31, 2015. As a result of this settlement (and the potential sale of our insurance business), we expect a further reduction in our insurance revenues in 2016.\nNet interest income increased $5.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the growth in both reverse loans and HMBS related obligations, offset partially by the increase in nonperforming reverse loans which have lower interest rates than performing loans. Cash generated by origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs included in the change in fair value increased $10.0 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of a shift in volume from lower margin new originations to higher margin tails. Net non-cash fair value adjustments included in the change in fair value fluctuated by $26.9 million from a gain in 2014 to a loss in 2015 due primarily to a lower reduction of LIBOR in 2015 as compared to 2014. In addition, in 2015 the impact of the reduction of LIBOR was offset by the widening of spreads between reverse loans and HMBS related obligations resulting from changes in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS. In 2014 there was a tightening of spreads. The conditional repayment rate utilized in the valuation of reverse loans and HMBS related obligations has increased from 21.68% and 21.21% at December 31, 2014, respectively, to 25.59% and 24.70% at December 31, 2015, respectively, as the portfolio ages and recent regulatory guidance surrounding due and payable policies has resulted in shorter projected default servicing timelines.\nWe believe that, based on current forecasts and anticipated market conditions, our current liquidity, along with the funds generated from our principal sources of liquidity discussed above, will allow for financial flexibility to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund operating needs and expenses, servicing advances, loan originations and repurchases of mortgage loans and HECMs, planned capital expenditures, current committed business and asset acquisitions, and all required debt service obligations for the next 12 months. We expect that significant acquisitions of servicing rights and other opportunities to grow by acquisition would need to be funded primarily through, or in collaboration with, external capital sources. Our operating cash flows and liquidity are significantly influenced by numerous factors, including interest rates and continued availability of financing. Our liquidity outlook assumes the renewal of existing mortgage loan servicing advance facilities, mortgage loan and reverse loan master repurchase agreements and reverse loan master repurchase agreements to fund repurchases of HECMs. In addition, management from time to time pursues other financing facilities. We may access the capital markets from time to time, in public or in private transactions, to augment our liquidity position, fund growth opportunities or for other reasons. We continually monitor our cash flows and liquidity in order to be responsive to changing conditions.\nGoodwill decreased $207.6 million due to a non-cash impairment charge to the asset carrying value recorded during the second and fourth quarters of 2015. The impairment testing is performed on each of our reporting units on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. At June 30, 2015, our analysis indicated impairment of the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit's goodwill, and as such we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $56.5 million. The primary cause of the goodwill impairment in the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit was the decline in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as a result of operational challenges in its retail origination channel; a reduction in opportunities for additional sub-servicing business; a greater than originally anticipated deferral of cash flows to future years with respect to previously introduced product changes; recent regulatory developments that could impact the likelihood of curtailment events in future periods; increasing liquidity requirements for the repurchase of certain HECMs and real estate owned from Ginnie Mae securitization pools; and an increase in obligations surrounding curtailment-related items existing at the time of the RMS acquisition. These factors resulted in reduced and delayed cash flows in the reverse mortgage business.\n\nRegulatory Developments\nYear Ended December 31, 2014\nThe overall delinquencies associated with our third-party servicing portfolio decreased at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 primarily because the new loans we originated and acquired have experienced a lower delinquency rate than our historical servicing portfolio had experienced.\n__________\nTotal expenses for our Other non-reportable segment decreased $3.4 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to $30.4 million in lower general and administrative and allocated indirect expenses largely resulting from costs incurred to affect corporate debt financing transactions in 2013. Our corporate debt transactions during 2013 included incremental borrowings under our 2012 Term Loan, the related subsequent refinancing activities under our 2013 Term Loan and the issuance of our Senior Notes. The decrease in expenses was partially offset by a $24.3 million increase in interest expense on corporate debt resulting from these corporate debt transactions. These financing transactions resulted in a higher average balance of corporate debt of $502.9 million, partially offset by a lower average interest rate of 48 basis points, which resulted in a lower cost of debt.\nAdjusted Earnings is defined as income (loss) before income taxes plus changes in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs and other assumptions; certain depreciation and amortization costs related to the increased basis in assets (including servicing rights and sub-servicing contracts) acquired within business combination transactions (or step-up depreciation and amortization); goodwill impairment, if any; the provision for curtailment expense, net of expected third-party recoveries, as described in footnote two to the Adjusted Earnings table below; share-based compensation expense; non-cash interest expense; restructuring costs; estimated settlements and costs for certain legal and regulatory matters; fair value to cash adjustments for reverse loans; and select other cash and non-cash adjustments primarily including certain non-recurring costs; severance; gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; the net impact of the Non-Residual Trusts; and transaction and integration costs. Adjusted Earnings excludes unrealized changes in fair value of MSRs that are based on projections of expected future cash flows and prepayments. Adjusted Earnings includes both cash and non-cash gains from mortgage loan origination activities. Non-cash gains are net of non-cash charges or reserves provided. Adjusted Earnings includes cash generated from reverse mortgage origination activities. Adjusted Earnings may from time to time also include other adjustments, as applicable based upon facts and circumstances, consistent with the intent of providing investors with a supplemental means of evaluating our operating performance.\nOur cash flows used in operating activities were $48.1 million during 2015. We finished 2015 with $202.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. Cash used in operating activities decreased by $156.2 million during 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of an increase in cash related to changes in assets and liabilities, including higher collections of servicer and protective advances and an increase in accrued expenses related to uncertain tax positions, partially offset by higher settlements of payables relating to servicer and protective advances acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of servicing rights and a decrease in accrued expenses related to legal and regulatory matters. In addition, cash increased due to proceeds received from the sale of a trading security received as consideration for the sale of the excess servicing spread associated with certain servicing rights. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash related to a lower volume of loans sold in relation to originated loans.\nOur servicing rights related liabilities have been excluded from the table above as repayment is based on future servicing fees received from residential loans underlying the servicing rights.\nIn July 2014, we completed an excess servicing spread transaction with WCO whereby we sold 70% of the excess servicing spread from a pool of servicing rights, with an unpaid principal balance of $25.2 billion, to WCO for a sales price of $75.4 million. In November 2015, we completed an additional excess servicing spread transaction with WCO whereby we sold 100% of excess servicing spread from a pool of servicing rights, with an unpaid principal balance of $7.5 billion, to WCO for a sales price of $46.8 million. We recognized the proceeds from the sales of the excess servicing spreads as financing arrangements. We elected to record the excess servicing spread liabilities at fair value similar to the related servicing rights. At December 31, 2015, the carrying value of our excess servicing spread liabilities was $100.1 million, the repayment of which is based on future servicing fees received from the residential loans underlying the servicing rights.\nOur servicing agreements impose on us various rights and obligations that affect our liquidity. Among the most significant of these obligations is the requirement that we advance our own funds to pay taxes, insurance and foreclosure costs and various other items, referred to as protective advances. Protective advances are required to preserve the collateral underlying the residential loans being serviced. In addition, we advance our own funds to meet contractual payment requirements for credit owners. As a result of bulk servicing right acquisitions in 2013 and 2014, we experienced and continue to incur an elevated level of advance requirements. Sub-servicers are generally reimbursed for advances in the month following the advance, so our advance funding requirements may be reduced if we succeed in increasing the fee-for-service mix in our servicing portfolio. In the normal course of business, we borrow money from various counterparties who provide us with financing to fund a portion of our mortgage loan related servicing advances on a short-term basis or provide for reimbursement within an agreed-upon period. Our ability to fund servicing advances is a significant factor that affects our liquidity, and to operate and grow our servicing portfolio we depend upon our ability to secure these types of arrangements on acceptable terms and to renew or replace existing financing facilities as they expire. However, there can be no assurance that these facilities will be available to us in the future. The servicing advance financing agreements that support our servicing operations are discussed below.\nInterest Expense\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $1.1 billion outstanding under all servicing advance facilities which have an aggregate capacity of $1.3 billion. The servicing advance facilities contain customary events of default and covenants, including financial covenants. Financial covenants most sensitive to our operating results and financial position are the requirements that a subsidiary maintain minimum tangible net worth, indebtedness to tangible net worth and minimum liquidity. Our subsidiary was in compliance with these financial covenants at December 31, 2015.\nOther Gains (Losses)\nGoodwill Impairment\nAdjusted EBITDA margin decreased three basis points in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to lower revenues (adjusted for the impact of the change in fair value) per loan serviced which primarily resulted from the decline in incentive and performance fees, intersegment retention revenue and insurance revenue.\nAdjusted Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA decreased $48.9 million and $48.8 million, respectively, in 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease in these non-GAAP financial measures was due primarily to the decline in cash generated from origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs\nRollforwards of the liability associated with representations and warranties are included below (in thousands):\nSalaries and Benefits\n (7) Unfunded commitments presented under indeterminate maturity above represents the aggregate unfunded borrowing capacity of borrowers under our reverse loans at December 31, 2015. This amount includes $868.3 million in capacity that was available to be drawn by borrowers at December 31, 2015 and $475.9 million in capacity that will become eligible to be drawn by borrowers throughout 2016 assuming the loans remain performing. There is no termination date for these drawings so long as the loan remains performing. \nOriginations\n (2) Consists of $194.8 billion and $49.3 billion in unpaid principal balance associated with servicing and sub-servicing contracts, respectively, at December 31, 2015 and $179.7 billion and $55.2 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2014. \nExpenses\n\nInterest Income on Loans\nOther - Our Other non-reportable segment primarily consists of the assets and liabilities of the Non-Residual Trusts, corporate debt and our asset management business, which we operate through GTIM.\nOther Gains (Losses)\nNet Servicing Revenue and Fees\nA summary of net servicing revenue and fees is provided below (dollars in thousands):\nOur results of operations are also affected by expenses such as salaries and benefits, information technology, occupancy, legal and professional fees, the provision for advances, curtailment, interest expense and other operating expenses. In addition, during 2015 and 2014, our expenses were impacted by non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $207.6 million and $82.3 million, respectively. Refer to the Financial Highlights, Results of Operations and Business Segment Results sections below for further information.\nOur profitability is dependent on our ability to generate revenue, primarily from our servicing and originations businesses. Our Servicing segment revenue is primarily impacted by the size and mix of our capitalized servicing and sub-servicing portfolios and is generated through servicing of mortgage loans for clients and/or credit owners. Net servicing revenue and fees includes the change in fair value of servicing rights carried at fair value and the amortization of all other servicing rights. Our servicing fee income generation is influenced by the level and timing of entrance into sub-servicing contracts and purchases and sales of servicing rights. The fair value of our servicing rights is largely dependent on the size of the related portfolio, discount rates and prepayment and default speeds. Our Originations segment revenue, which is primarily gains on sales of loans, is impacted by interest rates and the volume of loans locked as well as the margins earned in our various origination channels. Gains on sales of loans include the cost of additions to the representations and warranties reserve. Our Reverse Mortgage segment is impacted by new origination reverse loan volume, draws on existing reverse loans and the fair value of reverse loans and HMBS.\n (1) Volume has been adjusted by the percentage of mortgage loans not expected to close based on previous historical experience and changes in interest rates. \nIn December 2013, we completed the sale of $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, which pay interest semi-annually at an interest rate of 7.875% and mature on December 15, 2021. The balance outstanding on the Senior Notes was $528.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nNet gains on sales of loans include realized and unrealized gains and losses on loans held for sale, fair value adjustments on IRLCs and other related freestanding derivatives, values of the initial capitalized servicing rights, and a provision for the repurchase of loans. Net gains on sales of loans decreased $8.3 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $136.8 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of a shift in volume from the higher margin retention channel to the lower margin correspondent channel, partially offset by higher volumes of locked loans.\n (4) Average balance for corporate debt, servicing advance liabilities and master repurchase agreements is calculated as the average daily carrying value. \nServicing\nOur total assets and total liabilities decreased by $358.1 million and $86.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014. The most significant changes in assets and liabilities are described below.\nAncillary and other fees increased $11.7 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to growth in the servicing portfolio.\nServicing Advance Liabilities\nThe reverse mortgage sector has seen significant change in the past several years. Several of the largest reverse mortgage originators have left the industry and there have been significant changes made by the FHA and Ginnie Mae to the products offered, underwriting guidelines and servicing protocols. Loan volumes have been in decline over the last several years. According to an industry source, we believe HECM endorsements, which represent the insuring of loans by the FHA, will decrease slightly in 2016 and begin to grow in 2017 through 2022 based on forecasts of home pricing and the senior population. We believe the growth in endorsements is an indicator that reverse loan originations are expected to increase.\nSalaries and benefits expense remained flat in 2015 as compared to 2014. Although level between both years, 2015 had a decrease in compensation and benefits primarily due to lower average headcount and lower severance due mainly to the exit from the wholesale business in February 2014 and an office closure in 2014. These lower expenses were offset by higher incentives in 2015 due to an increase in funded volume, partially offset by the impact from the change in mix from higher incentive paying retention originations to lower incentive paying correspondent originations.\nThe Senior Notes Indenture contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, limits our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase our capital stock, make certain types of investments, create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries, incur certain liens, sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all of our assets to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The Senior Notes Indenture also contains customary events of default, including the failure to make timely payments on the Senior Notes or other material indebtedness, the failure to satisfy certain covenants and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency. We were in compliance with all covenants contained in the Senior Notes Indenture at December 31, 2015.\nNet fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations decreased $11.7 million during 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to the widening of spreads resulting from changes in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS and a lower reduction of LIBOR in 2015 as compared to 2014, offset partially by an increase in cash generated by origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs.\nInterest Income on Loans\nStrategy\nIncentive and performance fees include modification fees, fees earned under HAMP, asset recovery income, and other incentives. Modification fees and fees earned under HAMP decreased $30.4 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to a lower volume of completed modifications and lower fees for maintenance of performing modified loans no longer eligible for HAMP incentive fees. We expect to modify fewer loans in the future as a result of the scheduled termination of HAMP in December 2016 and there being a fewer number of loans in our servicing portfolio eligible for modification. In addition, asset recovery income decreased $7.9 million for 2015 as compared to 2014 as a result of lower gross collections due primarily to the runoff of the related loans managed by the Servicing segment. Incentives relating to the performance of certain loan pools serviced by us decreased $2.8 million for 2015 as compared to 2014. We expect incentives relating to the performance of loan pools serviced by us to continue to decline as a result of market and other factors, including changes in incentive programs, runoff of the related loan portfolio and improving economic conditions, which may reduce the opportunity to earn these incentives.\nEarly Advance Reimbursement Agreement\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.1 million and $13.3 million, respectively, in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to higher origination fee income, offset partially by lower net gains on sales of loans and higher expenses. We had a higher net provision for the repurchase of loans due primarily to a shift in volume of originations from the retention channel to the correspondent channel, which has a higher estimated defect rate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNet gains on sales of loans for our Originations segment consists of the following (dollars in thousands):\nSalaries and benefits increased $28.8 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in the number of employees as a result of hiring to support the growth of our servicing business and corporate operations. Headcount increased by approximately 300 full-time employees from approximately 6,400 at December 31, 2013 to approximately 6,700 at December 31, 2014.\n__________\nTotal expenses for 2014 were $1.6 billion, which represented an increase of $241.8 million, or 17%, as compared to 2013. The increase in expenses was primarily driven by the growth in our servicing portfolio coupled with an increased provision for uncollectible advances and increased costs for legal and regulatory matters outside of normal course of business, and an $82.3 million goodwill impairment charge recorded by our Reverse Mortgage reporting unit. In addition, interest expense increased $30.4 million primarily resulting from increased average corporate debt outstanding and increased servicing advance liabilities.\nIn 2015, in connection with our focus on efficient use of capital, we monetized certain non-core assets. In April 2015, we sold the residual interests in seven of the Residual Trusts and in the first quarter of 2015 we sold an equity method investment, as described in Business Segment Results. Further, we continue to work on a potential sale of substantially all of our insurance business. There can be no assurance this potential sale will be consummated. We may consider other asset sale opportunities if they arise.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nIn calculating income (loss) before income taxes for our segments, we allocate indirect expenses to our business segments. Indirect expenses are allocated to our Servicing, Originations, Reverse Mortgage and certain non-reportable segments based on headcount.\nServicing advance liabilities, which are utilized to finance servicer and protective advances, decreased $136.6 million primarily as a result of collections of servicer and protective advances, which are used to settle balances outstanding.\nAs market conditions warrant, we may from time to time, subject to limitations as stated in our 2013 Secured Credit Facilities, repurchase debt securities issued by us, in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.\nFinancing Transactions\nWe manage our Company in three reportable segments: Servicing, Originations and Reverse Mortgage. We measure the performance of our business segments through the following measures: income (loss) before income taxes, Adjusted Earnings, and Adjusted EBITDA. Management considers Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA, both non-GAAP financial measures, to be important in the evaluation of our business segments and of the Company as a whole, as well as for allocating capital resources to our segments. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental metrics utilized by management to assess the underlying key drivers and operational performance of the continuing operations of the business. In addition, analysts, investors, and creditors may use these measures when analyzing our operating performance. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and our use of these measures and terms may vary from other companies in our industry.\n\nGeneral and administrative and allocated indirect expenses decreased $17.4 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the management of expenses to align with the scope and scale of operations in 2014, partially offset by a higher volume of loans funded during 2014 coupled with a full year of mortgage loan originations activity in 2014 as compared to a condensed period in 2013.\nServicing Rights Related Liabilities\nOur representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits of exposure with the exception of certain loans originated under HARP, which limits exposure based on payment history of the loan. At December 31, 2015, our maximum exposure to repurchases due to potential breaches of representations and warranties was $51.3 billion, and was based on the original unpaid principal balance of loans sold from the beginning of 2013 through the year ended December 31, 2015 adjusted for voluntary payments made by the borrower on loans for which we perform the servicing. A majority of our loan sales were servicing retained.\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $11.7 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to a larger average headcount during the current year, higher incentives and higher severance. Salaries and benefits expense remained relatively flat in in 2014 as compared to 2013. As a result of an increase in defaulted loans and recent regulatory guidance surrounding due and payable policies which have resulted in shorter projected default servicing timelines, we have increased our headcount of employees dedicated to such servicing.\nOther Revenues\nInsurance revenue decreased $23.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $13.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of changes in GSE requirements and regulations that limited our ability to charge commissions for lender-placed insurance policies during 2014 that led to a decrease in our sales commissions related to lender-placed insurance policies beginning in June 2014 as well as runoff of existing policies. During 2014, these lower commissions were partially offset by commissions earned from an increase in lender-placed insurance policies issued prior to the effective date of the regulatory changes related to the 2013 and early 2014 bulk servicing right acquisitions.\nReverse Mortgage Business\n\n__________\n (4) Amounts presented are net of loan sales associated with servicing retained multi-channel recapture activities of $6.4 billion and $8.8 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. \n\n__________\nAt December 31, 2015, we serviced 2.2 million residential loans with a total unpaid principal balance of $266.6 billion. We have been one of the 10 largest residential loan servicers in the U.S by unpaid principal balance for the past three years according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Our originations business originated $25.1 billion in mortgage loan volume in 2015, ranking it in the top 20 originators nationally by unpaid principal balance according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Our reverse mortgage business is a leading integrated franchise in the reverse mortgage sector and, according to an industry source, was the third leading issuer of HMBS in 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOther revenues increased $29.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to the aforementioned $36.8 million in asset management performance fees, partially offset by a decline in asset management advisory fees.\nWe have a $1.5 billion 2013 Term Loan and a $125.0 million 2013 Revolver. Our obligations under the 2013 Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our assets subject to certain exceptions, such as the assets of the consolidated Residual and Non-Residual Trusts and consolidated financing entities, as well as the residential loans and real estate owned of the Ginnie Mae securitization pools that have been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2013\nServicing Rights Financing\nOur mortgage loan and reverse mortgage originations businesses diversify our revenue base and offer various sources for replenishing and growing the Company's servicing portfolio. During 2015, we originated and purchased $25.1 billion of mortgage loans, substantially all of which were added to our servicing portfolio upon loan sale. Of these originations, we added $17.6 billion of unpaid principal balance to our servicing portfolio through our correspondent channel. The majority of the remaining originations resulted from our retention activities associated with our existing servicing portfolio. Through our retention activities, we assist consumers in refinancing their loans, which reduces the runoff on our existing servicing portfolio.\nAdjusted Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA\n\nDitech Financial's Early Advance Reimbursement Agreement with Fannie Mae is used exclusively to fund certain principal and interest, servicer and protective advances that are the responsibility of Ditech Financial under its Fannie Mae servicing agreements. This agreement was renewed in April 2015 and now expires in March 2016. If not renewed, there will be no additional funding by Fannie Mae of new advances under the agreement. In addition, collections recovered during the 18 months following the expiration of the agreement are to be remitted to Fannie Mae to settle any remaining outstanding balance due under such agreement. Upon expiration of the 18 month period, any remaining balance would become due and payable. At December 31, 2015, we had borrowings of $156.7 million under the Early Advance Reimbursement Agreement, which has a capacity of $200.0 million.\n\n__________\n \u2022 Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; \nOn or prior to December 15, 2016, we may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at 107.875% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date. Prior to December 15, 2016, we may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a make-whole premium plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as of the redemption date.\n\nAdjusted Earnings margin decreased six basis points in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower revenues (adjusted for the impact of the change in fair value driven by changes in valuation inputs) per loan serviced, partially offset by lower expenses, primarily salaries and benefits, per loan serviced and a net gain resulting from the sale of a trading security and the sale of our residual interests. The decline in revenues per loan serviced is primarily due to the increase in realization of expected cash flows due mainly to faster prepayment speeds than anticipated and a larger servicing portfolio, and the decline in incentive and performance fees and insurance revenue.\nOther Net Fair Value Gains\n (5) Represents the non-cash fair value adjustment to arrive at cash generated from reverse mortgage origination activities. \nOn or after December 15, 2016, we may on any one or more occasions redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 105.906% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as of the redemption date, such optional redemption prices decreasing to 103.938% on or after December 15, 2017, 101.969% on or after December 15, 2018 and 100.000% on or after December 15, 2019.\nThe increase in servicing rights carried at fair value at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 related primarily to $544.6 million in servicing right portfolio acquisitions and servicing rights capitalized upon sales of loans, partially offset by a reduction in fair value of $402.0 million and sales of servicing rights of $60.1 million. The reduction in fair value of these servicing rights in 2015 was attributed to a loss of $157.3 million in changes in valuation inputs or other assumptions and a loss of $244.7 million in other changes in fair value which reflect the impact of the realization of expected cash flows resulting from both regularly scheduled and unscheduled payments and payoffs of loan principal.\nAdjusted Earnings\n (4) Restructuring costs include expenses related to the closing of offices and the termination of certain employees as well as other expenses to institute efficiencies. Restructuring costs incurred in 2015 to improve efficiencies within the organization included re-branding the mortgage loan originations business by consolidating Ditech Mortgage Corp and Green Tree Servicing into one legal entity with one brand, Ditech, a Walter Company, and measures taken to restructure the mortgage loan servicing operations and improve the profitability of the reverse mortgage business by streamlining its geographic footprint and strengthening its retail originations channel. These costs also include those relating to our exit from the consumer retail channel of the Originations segment. \n (8) Our Early Advance Reimbursement Agreement and servicing advance facilities above are included in servicing advance liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Collections of advances that have been reimbursed under the Early Advance Reimbursement Agreement require remittance upon collection to settle the outstanding balance. We are required to remit 60% to 85% of advances reimbursed under the servicing advance facilities to settle the balance outstanding under the agreements.  We exclude from the table above the amounts due under the Receivables Loan Agreement and the Indenture Agreement, which are included in servicing advance liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The Receivables Loan Agreement and the Indenture Agreement are non-recourse to us. Payments under these facilities are required upon collection of the underlying advances that have been reimbursed under the agreement.\nServicing Advance Facilities\nEach series of term notes and variable funding notes were issued in four classes. Interest on the term notes is based on a fixed rate per annum ranging from approximately 2.30% to 3.93% for the Series 2015-T1 term notes and 3.09% to 4.67% for the Series 2015-T2 term notes. The interest on the variable funding notes is based on one-month LIBOR, (or, in certain circumstances, the higher of (i) the prime rate and (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%) plus a per annum margin ranging from approximately 2.34% to 4.36%.\nWe incurred a $151.0 million impairment charge during 2015 as a result of a goodwill evaluation performed in the fourth quarter of 2015. The evaluation indicated the estimated implied fair value of the Servicing reporting unit's goodwill at the evaluation date was less than its book value, therefore requiring the impairment charge.\n (2) Average servicing fee is calculated by dividing gross servicing fees by the average unpaid principal balance of loans serviced.  The decrease in average servicing fee of one basis point for 2015 as compared to 2014, as well as the increase in average servicing fee of one basis point for 2014 as compared to 2013, related primarily to a benefit of $13.1 million recognized during 2014 from the settlement of differences in views between a prior servicer and the Company on how certain fees were recognized under a contract.\nProvided below are summaries of the activity in our mortgage loan servicing portfolio (dollars in thousands):\n (3) Includes $0.5 million in capital leases scheduled to mature in less than 1 year and included in corporate debt on the consolidated balance sheets. \nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we consolidated Ditech Mortgage Corp and Green Tree Servicing into one legal entity, Ditech Financial, with one brand, Ditech, a Walter Company. We believe this rebranding and consolidation will allow for greater focus on our consumers, will enhance brand recognition as mortgage loans originated by Ditech Financial will be serviced by the same brand, will simplify the process and improve quality for the consumer and will provide us with greater opportunities to cross-sell. We are focused on increasing our recapture rates from the serviced portfolio and believe the enhanced brand recognition will contribute to improving our recapture performance. The consolidation will also enable us to better leverage our resources and talent across the businesses and is expected to drive operational efficiencies. In addition, we exited the Originations segment's consumer retail channel in January 2016 and have focused on developing our Originations segment's consumer direct channel. Further, we have made and are continuing to make investments in technology which are designed to facilitate the originations process for borrowers.\nMortgage-Backed Debt\nThe change in estimate of existing reserves during 2014 is due primarily to timely payment history on loans originated under HARP and lower history of actual origination defects as compared to original expectation.\nMortgage Loan Originations Business\nServicing Rights Related Liabilities\nOther revenues include originations fee income and other miscellaneous income. Other revenues declined $4.9 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $3.6 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the decline in origination fee income resulting from fewer originations. In addition, during 2015 we charged lower fees to new borrowers.\nDuring 2015, we undertook a number of actions designed to strengthen the capital structure of the Company. These actions included the repurchase of approximately 2.4 million shares of common stock under our publicly announced repurchase authorization, the repurchase of Senior Notes with a carrying value of $35.7 million and a voluntary payment of $50.0 million on the 2013 Term Loan. We intend to pursue opportunities designed to further strengthen the Company's capital structure through the efficient deployment of capital generated from contemplated future actions including the aforementioned potential sale of the insurance business, potential sales of mortgage servicing rights or excess servicing spread or other similar assets, as well as cash generated from our operations.\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay debt and meet the financial obligations of our operations including funding acquisitions; mortgage loan and reverse loan servicing advances; obligations associated with the repurchase of reverse loans from securitization pools; funding additional borrowing capacity on reverse loans; origination of mortgage loans; and other general business needs, including the cost of compliance with changing legislation and related rules. Our liquidity is measured as our consolidated cash and cash equivalents excluding subsidiary minimum cash requirement balances, which are typically associated with our servicer licensing or financing agreements with third parties. This measure also includes our borrowing capacity available under the 2013 Revolver, as described under the Corporate Debt section below. At December 31, 2015, our liquidity was $256.7 million. At December 31, 2015, we had contractual obligations, subject to certain conditions and adjustments, to utilize approximately $27.7 million of this amount to fund acquisitions of servicing rights, including related servicer and protective advances, and certain payment obligations under our asset purchase agreement with RCS.\n\n (2) Calculated on funded volume.  The decline in direct margin in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to a shift in volume from the higher margin retention channel to the lower margin correspondent channel. This decline was partially offset by higher origination fees in 2015, the impact of lower direct expenses as a result of the exit from the wholesale business in February 2014, economies of scale as a result of higher loan volume and other cost cutting measures in 2014 and 2015.\nIn October 2012, we closed on a registered underwritten public offering of $290.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes pay interest semi-annually on May 1 and November 1, commencing on May 1, 2013, at a rate of 4.50% per annum, and mature on November 1, 2019.\nNet gains on sales of loans include realized and unrealized gains and losses on loans, the initial fair value of the capitalized servicing rights upon loan sales, as well as the changes in fair value of our IRLCs and other freestanding derivatives. The amount of net gains on sales of loans is a function of the volume and margin of our originations activity and is impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. A substantial portion of our gains on sales of loans is recognized at the time we commit to originate or purchase a loan at specified terms, as we recognize the value of the IRLC at the time of commitment. The fair value of the IRLC includes our estimate of the fair value of the servicing right we expect to receive upon sale of the loan. We recognize loan origination costs as incurred, which typically align with the date of loan funding for consumer originations and the date of loan purchase for correspondent lending. These expenses are primarily included in general and administrative expenses and salaries and benefits on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). In addition, we record a provision for losses relating to representations and warranties made as part of the loan sale transaction at the time the loan is sold.\n (2) Consists of activities associated with servicing and sub-servicing contracts. \nBorrower remittances received on the reverse loans, if any, and proceeds received from the sale of real estate owned and our funds used to repurchase reverse loans are used to reduce the HMBS related obligations by making payments to Ginnie Mae, who will then remit the payments to the holders of the HMBS. The maturity of the HMBS related obligations is directly affected by the liquidation of the reverse loans or liquidation of real estate owned and events of default as stipulated in the reverse loan agreements with borrowers. Refer to the below for additional information on repurchases of reverse loans.\n (1) Represents the net change in servicing rights carried at fair value resulting primarily from market-driven changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds. \nOther Non-Reportable\nWe recognized total other gains of $33.1 million in 2015, which include an $11.8 million gain recognized on the sale of an investment which was accounted for using the equity method; an $8.9 million realized gain recognized on the sale of a trading security; a $7.3 million net fair value gain relating to the Non-Residual Trusts; a $4.7 million net gain on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of Senior Notes and the voluntary prepayment on the 2013 Term Loan; a $3.1 million gain for consideration received for the contribution of Marix to WCO; and a $2.8 million loss recognized on the sale of our residual interest in seven of the Residual Trusts.\nOther Revenues\nWhile we had growth in both reverse loans and HMBS related obligations in 2014 as compared to 2013, we also had an increase in nonperforming reverse loans, which have lower interest rates than performing loans and as a result, net interest income was relatively flat. Cash generated by origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs included in the change in fair value decreased $53.9 million primarily as a result of lower margin new originations, partially offset by higher margin tails. Net non-cash fair value adjustments included in the change in fair value increased favorably by $42.6 million due to a reduction of LIBOR and the tightening of spreads between reverse loans and HMBS related obligations resulting from changes in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS.\n (2) Represents estimated settlement amounts for certain legal and regulatory matters outside of the normal course of business as well as legal costs and expenses associated with these matters. \nTotal other gains of $20.1 million in 2014 increased $25.8 million from total other losses of $5.8 million in 2013 due primarily to a loss on extinguishment of debt of $12.5 million incurred in 2013, $8.6 million in higher fair value gains on the Non-Residual Trusts in 2014 resulting from the aforementioned reduction to discount rates, and a $4.8 million loss incurred in 2013 related to an increase in the contingent earn-out liability related to a business acquisition.\nNet fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations decreased $10.4 million during 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to lower cash generated by origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs, offset partially by the tightening of spreads from changes in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS and a reduction of LIBOR.\nNet gains on sales of loans for the Company includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on loans as well as the changes in fair value of our IRLCs and other freestanding derivatives. A substantial portion of our gain on sales of loans is recognized at the time we commit to originate or purchase a loan at specified terms as we recognize the value of the IRLC at the time of commitment. The fair value of the IRLC includes our estimate of the fair value of the servicing right we expect to receive upon sale of the loan.\nProvided below are summaries of the activity in our third-party servicing portfolio for our reverse mortgage business, which includes accounts serviced for third parties for which we earn servicing revenue and, thus, excludes servicing performed related to reverse loans and real estate owned that have been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets, as the reverse loan transfer was accounted for as a secured borrowing (dollars in thousands):\nThe Servicing segment receives intercompany servicing fees related to on-balance sheet assets of the Originations segment and the Other non-reportable segment. Provided below are summaries of the composition of our mortgage loan servicing portfolio (dollars in thousands): \n (4) HMBS related obligations have no stated maturity. The maturity of HMBS related obligations is directly affected by the liquidation of the reverse loans or liquidation of real estate owned, including voluntary liquidation on behalf of the borrower, and events of default as stipulated in the reverse loan agreements with borrowers. Refer to the HMBS Issuer Obligations section above for HECM and real estate owned repurchase activity, which would exclude voluntary liquidations made on behalf of the borrower, during 2015 and 2014. There is no repurchase activity in instances where proceeds from voluntary liquidations are made on behalf of the borrower as such proceeds are used to settle the associated HMBS related obligation. \nWe transfer reverse loans that we have originated or purchased through the Ginnie Mae HMBS issuance process. The proceeds from the transfer of the HMBS are accounted for as a secured borrowing and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets as HMBS related obligations. The proceeds from the transfer are used to repay borrowings under our master repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2015, we had $10.0 billion in unpaid principal balance outstanding on the HMBS related obligations. At December 31, 2015, $10.0 billion in unpaid principal balance of reverse loans and real estate owned was pledged as collateral to the HMBS beneficial interest holders, and are not available to satisfy the claims of our creditors. Ginnie Mae, as guarantor of the HMBS, is obligated to the holders of the HMBS in an instance of RMS default on its servicing obligations, or when the proceeds realized on HECMs are insufficient to repay all outstanding HMBS related obligations. Ginnie Mae has recourse to RMS in connection with certain claims relating to the performance and obligations of RMS as both an issuer of HMBS and a servicer of HECMs underlying HMBS.\n__________\n__________\nIncome tax benefit increased $132.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to the increase in loss before income taxes offset by the impact on income taxes for non-deductible expenses such as the impairment of goodwill of the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit. These items were partially offset by a lower release of uncertain tax positions associated with state and local taxes due to a lapse in the statute of limitations from $3.6 million in 2014 to $2.1 million in 2015.\n (2) The average principal balance of loans serviced utilized in the calculation of the Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes adjustments related to servicing fee economics to reflect servicing right acquisitions closed during certain quarters as though they were closed at the beginning of the quarter, as economics (cash flows) were actually recorded for the full quarter. \nWe exclude mortgage-backed debt from the contractual obligations disclosed in the table above as this debt is non-recourse and not cross-collateralized and, therefore\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2015, two of Ditech Financial's master repurchase agreements were amended to allow for a net loss under their respective minimum profitability covenants. Without these amendments, Ditech Financial would not have been in compliance with these covenants for the quarter ended December 31, 2015.\nCapital Efficiency\nGeneral and Administrative and Allocated Indirect Expenses\n__________\nRefer to the Results of Operations and Business Segment Results sections below for further information on the changes addressed above. Also included in the Business Segment Results section is a discussion of changes in our non-GAAP financial measures. A description of our non-GAAP financial measures is included in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased Senior Notes with a carrying value of $35.7 million and an unpaid principal balance of $36.3 million for $30.0 million that resulted in a gain on extinguishment of $5.7 million, which is recorded in gains (losses) on extinguishments on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nIntersegment Retention Expense\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA\nSalaries and Benefits\nWe have four servicing advance facilities through several lenders and an Early Advance Reimbursement Agreement with Fannie Mae which, in each case, are used to fund servicer and protective advances that are our responsibility under certain servicing agreements. The servicing advance facilities and the Early Advance Reimbursement Agreement had an aggregate capacity amount of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2015. The interest rates are either fixed or are primarily based on LIBOR plus between 2.30% and 4.40% and have various expiration dates through October 2018. Payments on the amounts due under these agreements are paid from proceeds received by the subsidiaries (i) in connection with the liquidation of mortgaged properties, (ii) from repayments received from mortgagors, or (iii) from reimbursements received from the owners of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and private label securitization trusts. Accordingly, repayment of the servicing advance liabilities is dependent on the proceeds that are received on the underlying advances associated with the agreements. Two of the servicing advance facilities, with total borrowing capacity of $1.2 billion, are non-recourse to the Company.\nGeneral and administrative and allocated indirect expenses increased $14.8 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, due primarily to $24.3 million in higher legal accruals for loss contingencies and legal expenses due to legal and regulatory matters outside of normal course of business and $3.5 million of transaction costs resulting from an unsuccessful acquisition. These expenses were partially offset by a decrease of $12.8 million in the provision for our curtailment liability and our provisions for uncollectible receivables and advances and insignificant variances related to other expenses.\nContractual Obligations\nWe earn interest income on the residential loans held in the Residual Trusts and on our unencumbered mortgage loans, both of which are accounted for at amortized cost. During April 2015, we sold our residual interest in seven of the Residual Trusts, or sale of residual interests, and deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of these trusts. Interest income decreased $60.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to the aforementioned sale of our residual interests in 2015, runoff of the overall mortgage loan portfolio and a lower average yield on loans due to an increase in delinquencies that are 90 days or more past due.\nRollforwards of loan repurchase requests based on the original unpaid principal balance are included below (dollars in thousands):\nResidential loans at amortized cost decreased $773.1 million primarily as a result of the sale of our residual interests and the runoff of the overall related mortgage loan portfolio.\nInterest income decreased $60.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to the sale of our residual interests in 2015, runoff of the overall mortgage loan portfolio and a lower yield on loans due to an increase in delinquencies that are 90 days or more past due.\nFor a summary of the regulatory framework under which we operate and recent regulatory developments, refer to the Laws and Regulations section of Part I, Item 1. Business.\nAlthough we remain committed to expanding our servicing portfolio, we expect that over time we will seek to limit our investment in mortgage servicing rights. We plan to seek to sell mortgage servicing rights owned by us to WCO or to other third parties, generally on the basis that we are retained by the buyer to sub-service such rights. We may also seek to sell excess servicing spread or other similar assets. Our strategy for growing our servicing portfolio generally depends on being able to collaborate with owners of servicing rights in this manner. Our ability to effect such collaborations will depend on various factors such as the capital available to such parties, their ability to purchase servicing rights at a price attractive to them and agreement between us and them on the price and terms for our sub-servicing engagement.\n\n2014 Compared to 2013\n (1) Other additions include additions to the principal balance related to interest, servicing fees, mortgage insurance and advances.  Our repurchases of reverse loans and real estate owned have increased significantly as compared to 2014. We expect an increase to repurchase requirements due to the increased flow of defaulted HECMs and real estate owned that have moved through the buyout process.\n\n (1) Represents depreciation and amortization costs related to the increased basis in assets, including servicing and sub-servicing rights, acquired within business combination transactions. \n__________\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this report. This discussion contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and all of which could be affected by uncertainties and risks. Our actual results may differ materially from the results contemplated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors including, but not limited to, those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. Historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations, particularly in light of our recent acquisitions and regulatory developments discussed throughout this report. Refer to the Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 section located in the forepart in this report for a discussion regarding forward-looking statements.\n (6) Includes certain non-recurring costs, severance, gain on extinguishment of debt, the net impact of the Non-Residual Trusts and transaction and integration costs. \nGeneral and administrative and allocated indirect expenses decreased $27.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 resulting primarily from $40.7 million in lower legal related costs largely due to lower accruals for legal and regulatory matters outside of the ordinary course of business and $14.5 million in lower provision for uncollectible advances due to a decrease in advance balances and an improvement in collection experience, partially offset by $11.3 million in additional costs in 2015 to support efficiency and technology-related initiatives, $8.8 million in higher default and other loan servicing costs resulting from growth in the servicing portfolio, and $4.1 million in expenses relating to consolidating and re-branding our mortgage loan business as Ditech, a Walter Company.\nBorrower remittances received on the residential loans of the Residual and Non-Residual Trusts collateralizing this debt and draws under LOCs issued by a third-party and serving as credit enhancements to certain of the Non-Residual Trusts are used to make payments on the mortgage-backed debt. The maturity of the mortgage-backed debt is directly affected by the rate of principal prepayments on the collateral. As a result, the actual maturity of the mortgage-backed debt is likely to occur earlier than the stated maturity. Certain of our mortgage-backed debt issued by the Residual Trusts is also subject to voluntary redemption according to the specific terms of the respective indenture agreements, including an option by us to exercise a clean-up call. The mortgage-backed debt issued by the Non-Residual Trusts is subject to mandatory clean-up call provisions pursuant to which we are required to purchase the related mortgage loans from the trusts at the earliest of their exercisable call dates, which is the date each loan pool falls to 10% of the original principal amount. We anticipate the mandatory call obligations to settle beginning in 2017 and continuing through 2019 based upon our current cash flow projections for the Non-Residual Trusts. At December 31, 2015, the total estimated outstanding balance of the residential loans expected to be called at the respective call dates is $417.6 million. We expect to finance the capital required to exercise the mandatory clean-up call primarily through cash on hand, asset-backed financing or in partnership with a capital provider, or through any combination of the foregoing. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell the loans or obtain financing when needed. Our obligation for the mandatory clean-up call could have a significant impact on our liquidity.\n (3) Includes residential loans and real estate owned held by the Servicing segment for which it does not recognize servicing fees. \nWe endeavor to maintain our liquidity at a level sufficient to fund certain known or expected payments and to fund our working capital needs. Our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our business segments and funds available from our 2013 Revolver, master repurchase agreements, mortgage loan servicing advance facilities, issuance of HMBS and excess servicing spread financing arrangements. We may generate additional liquidity through sales of MSRs, any portion thereof, or other assets.\nInterest expense remained relatively flat in 2015 as compared to 2014. Interest expense decreased $4.2 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to lower average borrowings on master repurchase agreements resulting from a lower volume of loan fundings and lower cost of debt.\nProvided below is a summary of the average balances of our corporate debt, mortgage-backed debt of the Residual Trusts, servicing advance liabilities, and master repurchase agreements, as well as the related interest expense and average rates (dollars in thousands):\n (1) Past due status is measured based on either the MBA method or the OTS method as specified in the servicing agreement. Under the MBA method, a loan is considered past due if its monthly payment is not received by the end of the day immediately preceding the loan's next due date. Under the OTS method, a loan is considered past due if its monthly payment is not received by the loan's due date in the following month. Past due status is based on the current contractual due date of the loan, except in the case of an approved repayment plan, including a plan approved by the bankruptcy court, or a completed loan modification, in which case past due status is based on the modified due date or status of the loan. \nProvided below is a summary of results of operations, Adjusted Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA for our Reverse Mortgage segment (dollars in thousands):\nGeneral and Administrative and Allocated Indirect Expenses\nMortgage-backed debt decreased $688.1 million primarily as a result of the sale of our residual interests, which required the deconsolidation of the related mortgage-backed debt.\nInterest income decreased $10.2 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to runoff of the overall mortgage loan portfolio and a lower yield on loans due to an increase in delinquencies that are 90 days or more past due.\n (3) Included in retail originations volume for 2013 is activity related to retention initiated by the retail channel.  Net Gains on Sales of Loans\n\nNet fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations include the contractual interest income earned on reverse loans, including those not yet securitized or no longer in securitization pools, net of interest expense on HMBS related obligations, and the change in fair value of these assets and liabilities. Included in the change in fair value are gains due to loan originations that include \"tails.\" Tails are participations in previously securitized HECMs and are created by additions to principal for borrower draws on lines-of-credit, interest, servicing fees, and mortgage insurance premiums. Economic gains and losses result from the pricing of an aggregated pool of loans exceeding the cost of the origination or acquisition of the loan as well as the change in fair value resulting from changes to market pricing on HECMs and HMBS. No gain or loss is recognized as a result of the securitization of reverse loans as these transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings. However, HECMs and HMBS related obligations are marked to fair value, which can result in a net gain or loss related to changes in market pricing.\nOverview\nIn connection with this facility, we entered into an acknowledgment with Fannie Mae, dated as of December 19, 2014, and an amended and restated consent agreement with Freddie Mac, dated as of October 21, 2015, which (i) in the case of Fannie Mae, waived or (ii) in the case of Freddie Mac, subordinated, their respective rights of set-off against rights to reimbursement for certain servicer advances and delinquency advances subject to this facility. The Fannie Mae acknowledgment agreement remains in effect unless Fannie Mae withdraws its consent (i) at each yearly anniversary of the agreement by providing thirty days' advance written notice or (ii) upon certain other specified events. The Freddie Mac consent agreement automatically renews for successive annual terms; however, Freddie Mac may terminate its consent on 30 days' written notice. If either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac were to withdraw such waiver or subordination, as applicable, of its respective rights of set-off, our ability to increase the draws on the variable funding notes or maintain the drawn balances thereunder could be materially limited or eliminated.\nIntersegment retention expense relates to fees charged by our Servicing segment to the Originations segment in relation to loan originations that resulted from access to the Servicing segment's servicing portfolio for which there was a related capitalized servicing right recorded by the Servicing segment. The decline in intersegment retention expense of $9.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $19.3 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due primarily to the decline in funded retention volume for which there was an existing capitalized servicing right.\n (1) Calculated on pull-through adjusted locked volume. \n__________\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our servicing rights related liabilities and corporate debt, although it does reflect interest expense associated with our servicing advance liabilities, master repurchase agreements, mortgage-backed debt, and HMBS related obligations.  Because of these limitations, Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA only as supplements. Users of our financial statements are cautioned not to place undue reliance on Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA.\nOther revenues increased $15.6 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of $19.3 million in higher fair value gains relating to charged-off loans resulting primarily from twelve months of collection activity in 2015 compared to eight months in 2014 and an increase in expected collections, and $4.3 million higher other interest income, partially offset by $7.5 million lower beneficial interest income related to a servicing asset.\nMortgage Loan Servicing Portfolio\n (1) We earn a fixed dollar amount per loan on a majority of our third-party reverse loan servicing portfolio. The weighted-average contractual servicing fee for our third-party servicing portfolio was 0.14% and 0.16% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decline in the average fee was primarily a result of lower fees per loan for certain servicing agreements, combined with the impact of a higher average loan balance.  Net Fair Value Gains on Reverse Loans and Related HMBS Obligations\nMaster Repurchase Agreements\n (1) Other additions include additions to the principal balance serviced related to draws on lines of credit, interest, servicing fees, mortgage insurance and advances owed by the existing borrower.  Provided below are summaries of our reverse loan servicing portfolio (dollars in thousands):\nThe volatility in the gain on sale spread is attributable to market pricing, which changes with demand, channel mix, and the general level of interest rates. While many factors may affect consumer demand for mortgages, generally, pricing competition on mortgage loans is lower in periods of low or declining interest rates, as consumer demand is greater. This provides opportunities for originators to increase volume and earn wider margins. Conversely, pricing competition increases when interest rates rise as consumer demand lessens. This reduces overall origination volume and may lead originators to reduce margins. The level and direction of interest rates are not the sole determinant of consumer demand for mortgages. Other factors such as secondary market conditions, home prices, credit spreads or legislative activity may impact consumer demand more significantly than interest rates in any given period.\n\nReverse Mortgage\nInterest expense decreased $36.4 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the sale of our residual interests and the runoff of the overall related mortgage loan portfolio.\nInsurance Revenue\n \u2022 Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the change in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs and other assumptions; \n__________\nGeneral and administrative and allocated indirect expenses increased $131.8 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 resulting primarily from additional costs associated with growth in the servicing portfolio, which included a higher provision for uncollectible advances of $34.5 million, and $75.6 million in higher legal accruals for loss contingencies and legal expenses due to legal and regulatory matters outside of normal course of business. The higher provision for uncollectible advances is due to the growth in advances from servicing right acquisitions in 2013 and 2014, aging of balances and collection experience.\nSalaries and Benefits\nOther net fair value gains consists primarily of fair value gains and losses on the assets and liabilities of the Non-Residual Trusts and fluctuates generally based on changes in prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity, LIBOR rates and discount rates. Other net fair value gains decreased $11.9 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the reduction of discount rates utilized in the valuations of the assets and liabilities of the Non-Residual Trusts in 2014 resulting from tightening of yields in the market. Other net fair value gains increased $13.2 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the aforementioned reduction of discount rates in 2014 as well as a $4.8 million loss incurred in 2013 related to an increase in the contingent earn-out liability related to a business acquisition.\nWe utilize master repurchase agreements to support our origination or purchase of mortgage loans. These agreements were entered into by Ditech Financial. The five facilities had an aggregate capacity of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, the interest rates on the facilities were primarily based on LIBOR plus between 2.10% and 3.00% and have various expiration dates through October 2016. These facilities provide creditors a security interest in the mortgage loans that meet the eligibility requirements under the terms of the particular facility in exchange for cash proceeds used to originate or purchase mortgage loans. We agree to repay borrowings under these facilities within a specified timeframe, and the source of repayment is typically from the sale or securitization of the underlying loans into the secondary mortgage market. We evaluate our needs under these facilities based on forecasted mortgage loan origination volume; however, there can be no assurance that these facilities will be available to us in the future. The aggregate capacity includes $1.0 billion of committed funds and $1.3 billion of uncommitted funds. To the extent uncommitted funds are requested to purchase or originate mortgage loans, the counterparties have no obligation to fulfill such request. All obligations of Ditech Financial under the master repurchase agreements are guaranteed by the Parent Company. We had $1.2 billion of short-term borrowings under these master repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015, which included $305.8 million of borrowings utilizing uncommitted funds.\nAncillary and other fees, which primarily include late fees and expedited payment fees, increased $13.6 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to growth in the servicing portfolio.\n (3) Restructuring costs include expenses related to the closing of offices and the termination of certain employees as well as other expenses to institute efficiencies. Restructuring costs incurred in 2015 to improve efficiencies within the organization included re-branding the mortgage loan originations business by consolidating Ditech Mortgage Corp and Green Tree Servicing into one legal entity with one brand, Ditech, a Walter Company, and measures taken to restructure the mortgage loan servicing operations and improve the profitability of the reverse mortgage business by streamlining its geographic footprint and strengthening its retail originations channel. These costs also include those relating to our exit from the consumer retail channel of the Originations segment. \nMaster Repurchase Agreements\nServicer and protective advances decreased $165.2 million primarily as a result of collections of servicer and protective advances.\nReverse Mortgage Servicing Portfolio\n (5) Includes certain non-recurring costs, the net provision for the repurchase of loans sold, non-cash interest income, severance, gain on extinguishment of debt, interest income on unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, the net impact of the Non-Residual Trusts, the provision for loan losses, Residual Trust cash flows, transaction and integration costs and servicing fee economics.  Business Segment Results\nInterest expense increased $9.0 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of a higher average balance of servicing advance liabilities due to the growth of our servicing business as a result of portfolio acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on mortgage-backed debt issued by the Residual Trusts, as a result of a lower average outstanding balance as the related residential loan portfolio continues to runoff.\nThe Senior Notes were offered and sold in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act, and resold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of December 17, 2013, among the Company, the guarantor parties thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Senior Notes are guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by each of our current and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our 2013 Term Loan. On October 14, 2014, we filed with the SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act so as to allow holders of the Senior Notes to exchange their Senior Notes for the same principal amount of a new issue of notes with identical terms, except that the exchange notes are not subject to certain restrictions on transfer. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on October 27, 2014, the exchange offer expired on November 25, 2014, and settlement occurred on December 2, 2014.\nOur cash flows used in operating activities were $204.3 million during 2014. We finished 2014 with $320.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our operating cash flows increased by $1.6 billion during 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of a higher volume of loans sold in relation to originated loans given the ramp up of our mortgage loan originations business in 2013. Loan originations volume was significantly larger than volume sold in 2013. In 2014, the relationship of loan production to volume sold normalized. In addition, during 2013, the growth of our servicing portfolio required the use of additional funds for servicer and protective advances of $778.0 million of cash.\nAdjusted Earnings\nThe Company\n\nFrom time to time, we may look to selectively grow and add to our complementary businesses which leverage our core servicing portfolio and platform.\nFinancial Highlights\nAll of our master repurchase agreements contain customary events of default and covenants, the most significant of which are financial covenants. Financial covenants that are most sensitive to the operating results and resulting financial position are minimum tangible net worth requirements, indebtedness to tangible net worth ratio requirements, and minimum liquidity and profitability requirements.\n\nThe loss resulting from changes in valuation inputs or other assumptions of $157.3 million in 2015 was due primarily to a higher discount rate at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014, an increase in the assumed conditional prepayment rate and an increase in FHFA's house pricing index. The higher assumed conditional prepayment rate was primarily due to actual interest rates being lower than what the market forward interest rate curves had projected for future periods as of December 31, 2014. In addition, the assumed conditional prepayment rate was impacted by a change in mix with the growth of the Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae servicing rights. The conditional default assumption was lower primarily as a result of the aforementioned refinement of our valuation model.\nAdjusted Loss increased $4.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.9 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. The changes in these non-GAAP financial measures was due primarily to the growth in cash generated from origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs and net servicing revenue and fees, offset partially by higher expenses.\n__________\nThe following tables reconcile Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA to loss before income taxes, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nThe loss resulting from changes in valuation inputs or other assumptions of $124.5 million in 2014 was due primarily to a higher assumed conditional prepayment rate at December 31, 2014 as compared to December 31, 2013, which was largely driven by a lower interest rate environment and an increase in the FHFA's housing price index, partially offset by lower future HARP opportunities. There was a decline in the assumed conditional default rate, which was driven by portfolio acquisitions in 2014 that had lower risk profiles, and accordingly, lower assumed conditional default rates. Discount rates were reduced based on observable market rates.\n (5) Contractual obligations associated with acquisitions of servicing rights and related advances for which the Company has executed an agreement. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOther Revenues\nOther Revenues\nOriginations - Our Originations segment consists of operations that originate and purchase mortgage loans that are intended for sale to third parties. In 2015, the mix of mortgage loans sold by our Originations segment, based on unpaid principal balance, shifted from substantially all Fannie Mae conventional conforming loans during 2014 to approximately (i) 56% Fannie Mae conventional conforming loans, (ii) 35% Ginnie Mae loans, and (iii) 9% Freddie Mac conventional conforming loans. A substantial majority of our Ginnie Mae mortgage loan originations in 2015 were FHA-insured loans.\nWe incurred losses on our servicing rights carried at fair value primarily as a result of a declining interest rate environment. We had lower net gains on sales of loans due primarily to a shift in volume from the higher margin consumer retention channel to the lower margin correspondent lending channel. We had lower net fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations due primarily to lower cash generated by origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs, offset partially by the tightening of spreads from changes in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS and a reduction of LIBOR.\nThe maximum permitted principal balance of the variable funding notes that can be drawn at any given time is dependent upon the amount of eligible collateral owned by the issuer of the notes and, after giving effect to the issuance of the Series 2015-T1 term notes and the Series 2015-T2 term notes, may not exceed $600.0 million in the aggregate.\nAs servicer of reverse loans, we are also obligated to fund additional borrowing capacity in the form of undrawn lines of credit on floating rate and fixed rate reverse loans. We rely upon our operating cash flows to fund these additional borrowings on a short-term basis prior to securitization (when performing services of both the issuer and servicer) or reimbursement by the issuer (when providing third-party servicing). The additional fundings made by us, as issuer and servicer, are generally securitized within 30 days after funding. Similarly, the additional fundings made by us, as third-party servicer, are typically reimbursed by the issuer within 30 days after funding. Our commitment to fund additional borrowing capacity was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2015, which includes $868.3 million in capacity that was available to be drawn by borrowers at December 31, 2015 and $475.9 million in capacity that will become eligible to be drawn by borrowers throughout the twelve months ending December 31, 2016 assuming the loans remain performing. There is no termination date for these drawings so long as the loan remains performing. The obligation to fund these additional borrowings could have a significant impact on our liquidity.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nThe loss in fair value relating to our servicing rights related liabilities of $7.7 million for 2015 is comprised of $7.7 million in loss in fair value relating to excess servicing spread liabilities and less than $0.1 million in loss in fair value relating to servicing rights financing. The loss in fair value relating to our servicing rights related liabilities of $2.8 million for 2014 is entirely related to an excess servicing spread liability. The loss in fair value relating to excess servicing rights liabilities increased by $4.9 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to the change in interest expense which relates to the accretion of fair value. The higher interest expense was mainly due to having the 2014 excess servicing spread financing the entire twelve month period of 2015 as opposed to six months in 2014.\nConsumer-Focused Rebranding\nChanges in the fair value of servicing rights, which reflect our quarterly valuation process, have a significant effect on net servicing revenue and fees. A summary of key economic inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of servicing rights carried at fair value is presented below (dollars in thousands):\nGains (Losses) on Extinguishments\nOverview\nTotal Other Gains (Losses)\n (1) Average unpaid principal balance of loans serviced is calculated as the average of the average monthly unpaid principal balances. The average unpaid principal balance presented above includes on-balance sheet loans owned by the Servicing segment for which it does not earn a servicing fee. \n (3) Includes the loans of the seven Residual Trusts that were deconsolidated from our consolidated balance sheet upon sale in 2015 of our residual interests in those trusts. \nOther revenues increased $37.3 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to $36.8 million in the aforementioned asset management performance fees, a $22.5 million gain in fair value on charged-off loans acquired in 2014 and $4.5 million increase in income from our beneficial interest in a servicing asset. These increases were partially offset by $22.6 million in lower origination fee income resulting primarily from lower fees charged to borrowers for refinancing mortgage loans. Origination fee income was $22.9 million and $45.5 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe have an effective universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time an indeterminate number of our securities, including common stock, debt securities, preferred stock, warrants and units, having an aggregate initial offering price not to exceed $1.5 billion. This universal shelf registration statement expires on or about January 13, 2018.\nInterest Expense\nWe are a diversified mortgage banking firm focused primarily on servicing and originating residential loans, including reverse loans. We service a wide array of loans across the credit spectrum for our own portfolio and for GSEs, government agencies, third-party securitization trusts and other credit owners. Through our consumer and correspondent lending channels, we originate and purchase residential loans that we predominantly sell to GSEs and government entities. In addition, we operate several other complementary businesses which include managing a portfolio of credit-challenged, non-conforming residential mortgage loans; an insurance agency serving borrowers and credit owners of our servicing portfolio; a post charge-off collection agency; and an asset management business through our SEC registered investment advisor. These supplemental businesses allow us to leverage our core servicing capabilities and consumer base to generate complementary revenue streams.\nOther gains of $6.1 million for 2015 includes an $8.9 million realized gain recognized on the sale of a trading security, partially offset by a $2.8 million loss recognized on the sale of our residual interests.\nA summary of net servicing revenue and fees for our Reverse Mortgage segment is provided below (dollars in thousands):\nWhile we have been successful in implementing certain cost saving initiatives and we plan to continue to take actions across our businesses to improve efficiency and reduce expense, certain other costs have risen or are expected to rise. For example, we have been making investments and taking other measures to enhance the structure and effectiveness of our compliance and risk processes and associated programs across the Company, with a view to driving continuous improvements in our compliance results. The mortgage industry generally, including our Company, is subject to extensive and evolving regulation and continues to be under scrutiny from federal and state regulators and other government agencies. This oversight has led, in our case, to ongoing investigations and examinations of several of our business areas, and we have been and will be required to dedicate internal and external resources to providing information to and otherwise cooperating with such regulators and government agencies. In addition, we have incurred, and expect that in the future we will incur, expenses (i) associated with the remediation or other resolution of findings or concerns raised by regulators, government agencies and customers, (ii) to enhance the effectiveness of our risk and compliance program and (iii) to otherwise rectify instances of operational issues and other events of noncompliance discovered through our compliance program or otherwise. These investments to enhance our compliance and risk processes are also intended to result in an improved customer experience and competitive advantage for our business.\n (1) Securitized volume includes $404.0 million, $299.4 million and $189.4 million of tails securitized for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Tail draws associated with the HECM IDL product that commenced in late 2013 were $199.9 million and $44.8 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. There were no tail draws of the HECM IDL product in 2013.  The decline in both funded and securitized volume during 2014 as compared to 2013 is due primarily to regulatory changes to the HECM program, and to a lesser degree, increased competition. Regulatory changes impacted reverse mortgage loan products available to borrowers and reduced the available principal to be drawn initially by borrowers.\nCorporate Debt\nOur effective tax rate will always differ from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% due to state and local taxes and non-deductible expenses. Refer to Note 24 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. statutory tax rate.\nInterest income decreased $10.1 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to runoff of the overall mortgage loan portfolio and a lower average yield on loans due to an increase in delinquencies that are 90 days or more past due.\nServicing fees increased $33.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $130.8 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to growth in the third-party servicing portfolio resulting from portfolio acquisitions and servicing rights capitalized as a result of our loan origination activities, partially offset by runoff of the servicing portfolio. Incentive and performance fees decreased $39.6 million for 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to lower modification fees, fees earned under HAMP and asset recovery income, partially offset by higher real estate owned management fees. Ancillary and other fees increased $16.3 million for 2015 as compared to 2014 and $11.3 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to growth in the mortgage loan servicing portfolio. Refer to the Servicing segment discussion under our Business Segment Results section below for additional information on the changes in fair value relating to servicing rights and our servicing rights related liabilities.\nIf the Series 2015-T1 term notes are not redeemed or refinanced on or prior to October 17, 2016, and the Series 2015-T2 term notes are not redeemed or refinanced on or prior to October 15, 2018, one-twelfth of the related note balances will be required to be repaid on each monthly payment date thereafter. Failure to make any such one-twelfth payment will result in an event of default. We may repay and redraw the variable funding notes issued for 364-days from and including October 21, 2015, subject to the satisfaction of various funding conditions. If such 364-day period is not extended, the variable funding notes will become due and payable on October 19, 2016.\n \u2022 Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \nThe growth in net servicing revenue and fees of $7.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $8.1 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due primarily to an increase in incentive and performance fees for the management of real estate owned and in 2015, termination fees relating to the agreement to manage such real estate owned. In March 2015, we entered into an agreement with a counterparty to phase out the management of real estate owned through October 1, 2015. Fees associated with this contract approximated 63% and 75% of incentive and performance fees during 2015 and 2014, respectively, and as a result of the termination of the contract, we expect our incentive and performance fees to decline in 2016.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin decreased two basis points in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower revenues (adjusted for the impact of the change in fair value) per loan serviced, partially offset by lower expenses, primarily salaries and benefits, per loan serviced and a net gain resulting from the sale of a trading security and the sale of our residual interests. The decline in revenues per loan serviced is primarily due to the decline in incentive and performance fees and insurance revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nSenior Notes\n (2) Represents the realization of expected cash flows over time and includes $12.9 million in servicing rights transferred to us for no consideration in 2013.  We recognize servicing revenue and fees on servicing performed for third parties in which we either own the servicing right or act as sub-servicer. This revenue includes contractual fees earned on the serviced loans, incentive and performance fees earned based on the performance of certain loans or loan portfolios serviced by us, and loan modification fees. Servicing revenue and fees also includes asset recovery income, which is included in incentive and performance fees, and ancillary fees such as late fees and expedited payment fees. Servicing revenue and fees are adjusted for the amortization and change in fair value of servicing rights and the change in fair value of the servicing rights related liabilities.\nAdjusted Earnings margin decreased four basis points in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to lower revenues (adjusted for the impact of the change in fair value driven by changes in valuation inputs) per loan serviced which primarily resulted from the decline in incentive and performance fees, intersegment retention revenue and insurance revenue.\nResidential loans at fair value increased $840.8 million primarily as a result of the growth in our reverse loan portfolio and higher fundings of mortgage loans which outpaced sales, offset in part by a lower fair value adjustment on reverse loans. The fair value adjustment decreased as a result of wider pricing spreads, partially offset by lower LIBOR.\nWe are focused on using our capital efficiently. We continue to pursue three main strategies to bolster our servicing portfolio. First, we use our originations platform to refinance and retain loans in our current servicing portfolio as well as to generate new loans to add to our servicing portfolio. Second, we are planning to increase over time the portion of our servicing portfolio that is associated with sub-servicing contracts, which generate fee income for us with lower capital outlay, as compared to purchasing servicing rights. We expect certain banks and other owners of mortgage servicing rights (including potentially WCO) will seek to engage sub-servicers to assist with certain servicing portfolios, including portfolios of credit-sensitive and defaulted loans. We believe we are well-positioned to compete for such sub-servicing engagements, given the scale and track record of our servicing platform. Third, we may also, from time to time, consider acquiring mortgage servicing rights.\nGeneral and Administrative and Allocated Indirect Expenses\n\nProvided in the table below is a summary of the components of net fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations (dollars in thousands):\nServicing fees increased $131.2 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to growth in the third-party servicing portfolio resulting from portfolio acquisitions and servicing rights capitalized as a result of our loan origination activities, partially offset by runoff of the servicing portfolio. Average loans serviced increased by $38.2 billion, or 20%, in 2014 as compared to 2013.\n__________\nNet Servicing Revenue and Fees\nServicing - Our Servicing segment consists of operations that perform servicing for third-party credit owners of mortgage loans for a fee and the Company's own mortgage loan portfolio. The Servicing segment also operates complementary businesses consisting of an insurance agency serving residential loan borrowers and credit owners and a collections agency which performs collections of post charge-off deficiency balances for third parties and the Company. In addition, the Servicing segment holds the assets and mortgage-backed debt of the Residual Trusts.", "item_7_text": "We incurred $207.6 million and $82.3 million in impairment charges during 2015 and 2014. The goodwill evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2015 indicated the estimated implied fair value of the Servicing reporting unit's goodwill at the evaluation date was less than its book value, therefore requiring an impairment charge of $151.0 million. The goodwill evaluations performed in the second quarters of 2015 and 2014 indicated the estimated implied fair value of the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit's goodwill at each evaluation date was less than its book value, therefore requiring impairment charges of $56.5 million and $82.3 million, respectively. As a result of these goodwill impairment charges, the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit no longer has goodwill. Refer to Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for further discussion.\n (1) Realized gains (losses) on freestanding derivatives were $(67.0) million, $(134.8) million and $87.7 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  The decrease in net gains on sales of loans in 2015 and 2014 as compared to the corresponding prior year periods was primarily due to a shift in volume from the higher margin retention channel to the lower margin correspondent channel, offset partially by a higher volume of locked loans in each respective period. The higher volume of locked loans during 2015 as compared to 2014 was largely due to lower average interest rates in 2015, while the higher volume of locked loans in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due to having a full twelve months of activity in 2014 as opposed to a condensed period in 2013. Additionally, we had higher capitalized servicing rights during 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to a higher volume of loans sold as well as a change in mix from substantially all Fannie Mae in 2014 to approximately 35% Ginnie Mae, which have a higher servicing fee than GSE loans, and 65% Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in 2015. The condensed period in 2013 results from the acquisition of the capital markets and originations platforms from ResCap on January 31, 2013 and the correspondent lending business from Ally Bank on March 1, 2013. These acquisitions initiated the ramp up of our mortgage loan originations business.\nTotal other gains increased $6.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to an $11.8 million gain recognized on the sale of an investment which was accounted for using the equity method; a $4.7 million net gain on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of Senior Notes and the voluntary prepayment on the 2013 Term Loan; and a $3.1 million gain for consideration received for the contribution of Marix to WCO. These gains were partially offset by $12.8 million in lower net fair value gains on the assets and liabilities of the Non-Residual Trusts as 2014 included the impact of changes in assumptions related to the reduction of discount rates resulting from tightening of yields in the market.\n\nThe majority of the approximately $10.0 trillion in U.S. residential mortgage debt outstanding has historically been serviced by large money-center banks, which generally focus on conventional mortgages with low delinquency rates. This allowed for low-cost, routine payment processing and required minimal consumer interaction. Following the credit crisis, the need for high-touch\u201d specialty servicers, such as Ditech Financial, increased as loan performance declined, delinquencies rose and servicing complexities broadened.\nOther revenues consists primarily of asset management performance fees, the change in fair value of charged-off loans, income associated with our beneficial interest in a servicing asset, and origination fee income. Other revenues decreased $1.6 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to $36.8 million in asset management performance fees collected and earned by our Other non-reportable segment in connection with the investment management of a fund during 2014 and $7.5 million in lower income from our beneficial interest in a servicing asset. The performance fees were earned in connection with the liquidation of the fund's investments during 2014 and are based on the fund exceeding pre-defined thresholds. These fees are recorded when the fund is terminated or when the likelihood of claw-back is improbable. The decrease in these revenues was partially offset by $19.3 million in higher fair value gains relating to charged-off loans as a result of twelve months of collection activity in 2015 compared to eight months in 2014 and an increase in expected collections; $17.7 million in higher origination fee income resulting from the refinancing of mortgage loans partially offset by lower fees charged to new reverse loan borrowers; and $6.2 million in higher other interest income. Origination fee income was $40.6 million and $22.9 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n__________\n (3) Master repurchase agreements are held by the Originations and Reverse Mortgage segments. \nIn November 2015, we completed the sale of servicing rights, with an unpaid principal balance of $1.8 billion, to WCO for a sales price of $17.8 million. We recognized the proceeds from the sale of the servicing rights as a financing arrangement. We elected to record the servicing rights financing at fair value similar to the related servicing rights. The repayment of such financing is based on future servicing fees received from the residential loans underlying the servicing rights. At December 31, 2015, the carrying value of our servicing rights financing and the related servicing rights was $16.9 million. We have a receivable due from WCO for this sale of $8.9 million at December 31, 2015. In November 2015, we also entered into a sub-servicing arrangement with WCO pursuant to which we will sub-service the residential loans underlying such servicing rights in exchange for a sub-servicing fee.\nWe reconcile our income (loss) before income taxes for our business segments to our GAAP consolidated income (loss) before taxes and report the financial results of our Non-Residual Trusts, other non-reportable operating segments and certain corporate expenses as other activity. Refer below for further information on the results of operations for our Servicing, Originations and Reverse Mortgage segments. For a reconciliation of our income (loss) before income taxes for our business segments to our GAAP consolidated income (loss) before income taxes, refer to Note 27 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.\n__________\nInterest expense increased $30.4 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to corporate debt transactions throughout 2013, which included incremental borrowings under our 2012 Term Loan and related subsequent refinancing activities under our 2013 Term Loan and the issuance of our Senior Notes. These financing transactions resulted in a higher average balance of our corporate debt, but a lower average interest rate as compared to 2013. In addition, interest expense increased as a result of a higher average balance of servicing advance liabilities, which are utilized to finance servicer and protective advances, due to our growing servicing business. These increases were partially offset by decreases in interest expense related to mortgage-backed debt and master repurchase agreements. Interest expense related to mortgage-backed debt decreased as a result of a lower average outstanding balance as the portfolio continues to run off. Interest expense related to master repurchase agreements decreased primarily as a result of a lower average interest rate. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for additional information on our debt.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had repurchased 2,382,733 shares of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase plan at an aggregate cost of $28.1 million, or an average cost of $11.78 per share. Shares of common stock that we repurchase are canceled and return to the status of authorized but unissued shares.\nIf a change of control, as defined under the Senior Notes Indenture, occurs, the holders of our Senior Notes may require that we purchase with cash all or a portion of these Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.\n (2) Represents the realization of expected cash flows over time and includes $12.9 million in servicing rights transferred to the Company for no consideration during 2013. \n (6) Refer to Note 29 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for further information regarding unfunded commitments. \n (2) Our warehouse borrowings are repaid primarily with proceeds from sales of mortgage loans and securitizations of reverse loans. \nRefer to the Business Segment Results section below for additional information regarding general and administrative expenses for each of our segments.\nAdjusted EBITDA eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) before income taxes; amortization of servicing rights and other fair value adjustments; interest expense on corporate debt; depreciation and amortization; goodwill impairment, if any; the provision for curtailment expense, net of expected third-party recoveries, as described in footnote one to the Adjusted EBITDA table below; share-based compensation expense; restructuring costs; estimated settlements and costs for certain legal and regulatory matters; fair value to cash adjustments for reverse loans; and select other cash and non-cash adjustments primarily certain non-recurring costs; the net provision for the repurchase of loans sold; non-cash interest income; severance; gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; interest income on unrestricted cash and cash equivalents; the net impact of the Non-Residual Trusts; the provision for loan losses; Residual Trust cash flows; transaction and integration costs; and servicing fee economics. Adjusted EBITDA includes both cash and non-cash gains from mortgage loan origination activities. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of fair value option accounting on certain assets and liabilities and includes cash generated from reverse mortgage origination activities. Adjusted EBITDA may also include other adjustments, as applicable based upon facts and circumstances, consistent with the intent of providing investors a supplemental means of evaluating our operating performance.\nNet Gains on Sales of Loans\n \u2022 Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash expenditures for long-term assets and other items that have been and will be incurred, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nUnder this facility, creditors of the issuer and depositor entities (including the holders of the term notes and variable funding notes) have no recourse to any assets or revenues of Ditech Financial or the Parent Company other than to the limited extent of Ditech Financial's or the Parent Company's obligations with respect to various representations and warranties, covenants and indemnities under this facility and the Parent Company's obligations as a guarantor of certain of Ditech's representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities under the facility. Creditors of the Parent Company and Ditech Financial do not have recourse to any assets or revenues of either the issuer or depositor entities under the facility.\n\n (4) At December 31, 2015 includes $6.6 billion in unpaid principal balance of sub-servicing performed for WCO and $1.7 billion associated with servicing rights sold to WCO.  The unpaid principal balance of our third-party servicing portfolio increased $9.2 billion at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 primarily due to our originations sales with servicing retained and servicing and sub-servicing portfolio acquisitions, partially offset by runoff of the portfolio. Sub-servicing portfolio acquisitions include new sub-servicing performed for WCO. The decrease in the unpaid principal balance of our on-balance sheet residential loans and real estate owned of $735.5 million can be attributed to the sale of our residual interests, which resulted in the deconsolidation of the related loans, combined with the overall portfolio runoff of the assets held by the Residual and Non-Residual Trusts, partially offset by an increase in mortgage loans held for sale of $213.8 million. The unpaid principal balance of loans associated with the sale of the seven Residual Trusts is included in our third-party servicing portfolio at December 31, 2015 since we continue to service these loans.\nInterest expense increased $6.6 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $1.4 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher average borrowings on master repurchase agreements due to higher volumes of loan fundings, partially offset by lower average costs of debt. In addition, there was a full year of mortgage loan originations activity in 2014 as compared to a condensed period in 2013.\n (2) We exited the wholesale business in February 2014. \nGoodwill Impairment\n\nTerm Loans and Revolver\nReverse Loan Securitizations\n (6) On-balance sheet residential loans and real estate owned primarily includes mortgage loans held for sale as well as assets of the Non-Residual Trusts and Residual Trusts.  The portfolio disappearance rate, consisting of contractual payments, voluntary prepayments and defaults, of the total mortgage loan portfolio, was 14.23% in 2015.\nThrough RMS's warehouse facilities under master repurchase agreements we finance the origination or purchase of reverse loans and repurchases of certain HECMs and real estate owned from Ginnie Mae securitization pools. At December 31, 2015, we had a facility with a capacity of $125.0 million that could be used to originate or purchase reverse loans and another facility with a capacity of $100.0 million that could be used to repurchase HECMs and real estate owned from Ginnie Mae securitization pools. The interest rates on the facilities are primarily based on LIBOR plus between 2.50% and 3.13% and have expiration dates through October 2016. These facilities are secured by the underlying asset and provide creditors a security interest in the assets that meet the eligibility requirements under the terms of the particular facility. We agree to repay the borrowings under these facilities within a specified timeframe, and the source of repayment is typically from proceeds received on the securitization of the underlying reverse loans, claim proceeds received from HUD or liquidation proceeds from the sale of real estate owned. We evaluate our needs under these facilities based on forecasted reverse loan origination volume and repurchases; however, there can be no assurance that these facilities will be available to us in the future. At December 31, 2015, $175.0 million of the aggregate capacity has been provided on an uncommitted basis, and as such, to the extent these funds are requested to purchase or originate reverse loans or repurchase HECMs and real estate owned from Ginnie Mae securitization pools, the counterparties have no obligation to fulfill such request. All obligations of RMS under the master repurchase agreements are guaranteed by the Parent Company. We had $122.3 million of borrowings under these master repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015 which included $87.4 million of borrowings relating to repurchases of HECMs and real estate owned.\nIn conjunction with our originations business, we provide representations and warranties on loan sales. We sell substantially all of our originated or purchased mortgage loans into the secondary market for securitization or to private investors as whole loans. We sell conventional conforming and government-backed mortgage loans through GSE and agency-sponsored securitizations in which mortgage-backed securities are created and sold to third-party investors. We also sell non-conforming mortgage loans to private investors. In doing so, representations and warranties regarding certain attributes of the loans are made to the third-party investor. Subsequent to the sale, if it is determined that a loan sold is in breach of these representations or warranties, we generally have an obligation to cure such breach. In general, if we are unable to cure such breach, the purchaser of the loan may require us to repurchase such loan for the unpaid principal balance, accrued interest, and related advances, and in any event, we must indemnify such purchaser for certain losses and expenses incurred by such purchaser in connection with such breach. Our credit loss may be reduced by any recourse we have to correspondent lenders that, in turn, have sold such residential loans to us and breached similar or other representations and warranties.\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $34.9 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due to hiring to support the growth of our business, including the hiring of EverBank employees in 2014. Headcount assigned directly to our Servicing segment increased by approximately 500 full-time employees from 3,700 at December 31, 2013 to 4,200 at December 31, 2014.\nIn conjunction with our exit from the Originations segment's consumer retail channel in January 2016, we continued our expense reduction efforts and further reorganized Ditech Financial in an attempt to improve our efficiency. One-time costs associated with the measures taken in January 2016 are estimated to be approximately $5 million. The consumer retail channel incurred a direct margin loss of approximately $11 million in 2015. In addition to the elimination of this loss in future annual periods, the January 2016 reorganization activities are expected to result in additional annual cost savings of approximately $17 million. Further, as part of our ongoing technology improvement and customer experience enhancement initiatives, we commenced a project in February 2016 to review many of our operating processes. We expect to complete our initial review of such processes in the second quarter of 2016 and plan to move forward with implementation of identified action items thereafter.\nMortgage Loan Servicing Business\n (1) Our Other non-reportable segment includes $36.8 million in asset management performance fees collected and earned in connection with the asset management of a fund. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOther changes in fair value above consist of the realization of expected cash flows. The increase in realization of expected cash flows of $95.7 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 was due primarily to faster prepayment speeds than anticipated and a larger servicing portfolio resulting from acquisitions of servicing rights, including those from loan origination activities.\nThe material terms of our 2013 Secured Credit Facilities are summarized in the table below:\nGeneral and administrative and allocated indirect expenses increased $15.0 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to a $10.2 million increase in expenses related to regulatory developments in 2015 which led to additional charges around curtailable events and to accrual adjustments associated with legal and regulatory matters outside of the normal course of business. In addition, there was a $6.8 million increase in curtailment due primarily to an increase in missed timelines driven by an increase in volume resulting from the contraction of default servicing timeframes due to recent regulatory changes and an increase in the related exposure to incurred but not known deaths of the mortgagor and the mortgagor's vacancy from their principal residence. Further there was a $2.8 million increase in advertising and a $6.9 million net increase in various miscellaneous expenses including real estate owned management support services, equipment maintenance and occupancy expenses. These higher charges were partially offset by $8.2 million in lower provisions on uncollectible receivables and advances resulting from improved collections and recent historical experience, as well as transaction costs of $3.5 million recorded in 2014 related to an unsuccessful acquisition, with no similar charge in 2015.\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA decreased $98.1 million and $100.9 million, respectively, in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to reduced net gains on sales of loans. During 2013, the business substantially ramped up operations due to first quarter 2013 acquisitions; therefore locked volume was significantly larger than funded volume. As a result, 2013 had higher revenues in relation to expenses. In 2014, the relationship of locked volume to funded volume normalized.\n \u2022 Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect certain tax payments that represent reductions in cash available to us; \nSalaries and benefits expense decreased $12.4 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the reduction in workforce in order to align the employee base with the scope and scale of operations in 2014, which included our exit from the mortgage wholesale channel, partially offset by higher volume of loans funded during 2014 coupled with a full year of mortgage loan originations activity in 2014 as compared to a condensed period in 2013.\n (1) Represents the provision for curtailment expense, net of expected third-party recoveries, related to historical practices at RMS that have led to increasing exposure for historical periods as regulatory requirements are clarified. Current practices have been revised in order to minimize current and future exposure to curtailable events. Our non-GAAP measures are not adjusted for accruals for current period curtailable events as such accruals are considered part of ongoing operating results of the business. \nFinancial Condition - Comparison of Consolidated Financial Condition at December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2014\n (1) Amounts relate to future cash payments for interest expense on our 2013 Term Loan, Convertible Notes and Senior Notes and are calculated by multiplying outstanding principal balances by the respective interest rate for each commitment at December 31, 2015. \nDuring 2013, we recognized a $12.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt resulting from a $300.0 million early repayment of the 2012 Term Loan with proceeds from our Senior Notes and the refinancing of the remaining $1.4 billion 2012 Term Loan (including incremental borrowings) with our $1.5 billion 2013 Term Loan.\n\nSalaries and benefits decreased $1.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits resulting from a lower average headcount during 2015, partially offset by an increase in share-based compensation due largely to a higher number of awards granted and the acceleration of expense associated with a former employee's unvested awards, and increases in bonuses and severance. Headcount decreased by approximately 800 full-time employees from approximately 6,700 at December 31, 2014 to approximately 5,900 at December 31, 2015.\nIncluded in other changes in fair value above is the realization of expected cash flows and, during 2013, $12.9 million in servicing rights transferred to us for no consideration. The increase in realization of expected cash flows of $30.9 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due primarily to acquisitions of servicing rights, including those from loan origination activities, partially offset by slower prepayment speeds than anticipated.\nIn 2015, we began taking actions across our businesses to improve efficiency and reduce expenses. For example, we captured opportunities for enhanced benefits from shared services and the acceleration of automation efforts. We believe that the actions we took are likely to provide at least $75 million in annual cost savings beginning in 2016. One-time costs associated with the implementation of these initiatives were approximately $15 million.\nServicing Rights Carried at Fair Value\nOn June 22, 2015, as a result of a group of affiliated stockholders of the Company publicly disclosing on a Schedule 13D filing with the SEC that it had acquired beneficial ownership in excess of 20% of the outstanding common stock of the Company, a change of control\u201d event of default occurred under a master repurchase agreement relating to one of our mortgage warehouse facilities, which then caused a cross-default\u201d event of default to occur under certain other master repurchase agreements relating to certain additional mortgage warehouse facilities. We promptly obtained waivers for such change of control\u201d event of default and each related cross-default\u201d event of default from all applicable lenders. The master repurchase agreement under which the change of control\u201d event of default occurred was also amended to remove the change of control provision as it relates to the Parent Company.\nReverse Loan Servicer Obligations\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the change in fair value resulting from the realization of expected cash flows; and \n\n (1) Margins are calculated by dividing the applicable non-GAAP measure by the average principal balance of loans serviced during the year. \nThe mortgage industry has seen a significant shift in the servicing landscape since the housing downturn in 2008, as specialty servicers either sub-serviced or acquired portfolios that money-center banks and others have sought to divest. While the five largest bank servicers once commanded a nearly 60% market share of the servicing sector, their share had declined to approximately 37% at December 31, 2015. Over the next several years we expect banking organizations will continue to seek to transfer servicing to specialty servicers as they focus on their core client base and shift servicing for non-core clients and credit-sensitive loans and comply with recent changes in banking organization capital rules.\n (1) Average balance is calculated as the average recorded investment in the loans at the beginning of each month during the year.  Net Fair Value Gains on Reverse Loans and Related HMBS Obligations\nProvided below is a summary of results of operations, Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA for our Originations segment (dollars in thousands): \nThe facility's base indenture and indenture supplements include facility events of default and target amortization events customary for financings of this type, including but not limited to target amortization events related to breaches of covenants, defaults under certain other material indebtedness, material judgments, certain tests related to the collection and performance of the receivables securing the notes issued pursuant to the base indenture and the applicable indenture supplement, and with respect to the variable funding notes, certain financial tests and change of control. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, specified percentages of noteholders have the right to terminate all commitments and accelerate the notes under the base indenture, enforce their rights with respect to the collateral and take certain other actions. The events of default include, among other events, the occurrence of any failure to make payments (subject to certain cure periods and including balances due after the occurrence of a target amortization event), failure of Ditech Financial to satisfy various deposit and remittance obligations as servicer of certain mortgage loans, the requirement of a subsidiary, Green Tree Agency Advance Funding Trust I, to be registered as an investment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, certain tests related to the collection and performance of the receivables securing the notes issued pursuant to the base indenture and applicable indenture supplement, removal of Ditech Financial's status as an approved seller or servicer by either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and bankruptcy events.\nTotal expenses for 2015 were $1.7 billion, which represented an increase of $86.7 million, or 5%, as compared to 2014. We incurred $56.5 million and $82.3 million in impairment charges in the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $151.0 million in impairment charges in our Servicing reporting unit during the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result of the goodwill impairment charges in the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit, this reporting unit no longer has goodwill. In addition, we had $33.5 million in lower interest expense related to mortgage-backed debt primarily due to the aforementioned sale of our residual interest in seven of the Residual Trusts.\nResults of Operations - Comparison of Consolidated Results of Operations (dollars in thousands):\nGeneral and administrative and allocated indirect expenses increased $10.1 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to higher loan origination expenses due to an increased volume of loan fundings and increased advertising resulting from additional mail solicitations and internet lead generations as well as re-branding for our mortgage loan business under Ditech, a Walter Company. In addition, we had a larger reduction in 2014 to our estimate of the liability associated with our representations and warranties for sales of mortgage loans due to the prior year including a reduction to our reserves as a result of timely payment history on loans originated under HARP and lower actual origination defects as compared to original expectations. Under HARP, after one year of timely payments by the borrower since the origination of the loan, our exposure to the liability associated with representations and warranties becomes limited in nature. In the prior year, we had more loans completing one year of timely payments and such loans had higher initial reserves established due to a higher initial estimate of defects. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower occupancy, printing and mailing costs in support of cost savings measures.\n\nProvided below is a summary of results of operations, Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA for our Servicing segment (dollars in thousands):\nWe incurred $56.5 million and $82.3 million in impairment charges during 2015 and 2014 as a result of goodwill evaluations performed in the second quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. The evaluations indicated the estimated implied fair value of the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit's goodwill at each evaluation date was less than its book value, therefore requiring the impairment charges. As a result of these goodwill impairment charges, the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit no longer has goodwill.\nProvided below is a summary of origination economics for all channels (in basis points):\nRefer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for a description of our financing transactions.\nThe collateral securing the term notes and the variable funding notes consists primarily of rights to reimbursement for servicer and protective advances in respect of certain mortgage loans serviced by Ditech Financial on behalf of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.\nProvided below is a summary of the average unpaid principal balance of loans serviced and the related average servicing fee for our Servicing segment (dollars in thousands):\nAs a result of Ditech Financial obtaining these amendments, we were in compliance with all financial covenants relating to master repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015.\nBeginning in 2015, the Originations segment recognizes the initial fair value of the entire commitment, including the servicing rights component, on the date of the commitment, while the Servicing segment recognizes the change in fair value of the servicing rights component of our IRLCs and loans held for sale that occurs subsequent to the date of our commitment through the sale of the loan. Net gains on sale of loans for the Servicing segment consists of this change in fair value as well as net gains on sales of loans to third parties.\nThe following table summarizes, by remaining maturity, our future cash obligations at December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nOn May 6, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized us to repurchase up to $50.0 million of shares of our common stock, during the period beginning on May 11, 2015 and ending on May 31, 2016. Repurchases may be made from time to time based upon our discretion through one or more open market or privately negotiated transactions, and pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. The timing and amounts of any such repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of our shares and general market and economic conditions. The share repurchase program may be extended, suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.\nReconciliation of GAAP Consolidated Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes to Adjusted Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands): \nAt December 31, 2015, mortgage-backed debt was collateralized by $1.1 billion of assets including residential loans, receivables related to the Non-Residual Trusts, real estate owned and restricted cash and cash equivalents. All of the mortgage-backed debt is non-recourse and not cross-collateralized and, therefore, must be satisfied exclusively with the proceeds from the residential loans and real estate owned held in each securitization trust and also from draws on the LOCs of certain Non-Residual Trusts.\nIntersegment retention revenue relates to fees for Servicing segment charges to our Originations segment for loan originations completed by the Originations segment that resulted from access to the Servicing segment's servicing portfolio for which there was a related capitalized servicing right. The decline in intersegment retention revenue of $9.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $19.3 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due primarily to the decline in funded retention volume for which there was an existing capitalized servicing right.\n\n (2) Mortgage-backed debt of the Residual Trusts and servicing advance liabilities are held by our Servicing segment. \n\n (1) Represents the net change in servicing rights carried at fair value resulting primarily from market-driven changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds. \nAll of our master repurchase agreements contain customary events of default and covenants, the most significant of which are financial covenants. Financial covenants that are most sensitive to the operating results and resulting financial position are minimum tangible net worth requirements, indebtedness to tangible net worth ratio requirements, and minimum liquidity and profitability requirements. RMS was in compliance with its financial covenants relating to master repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015.\nOther gains of $21.0 million for 2015 include an $11.8 million gain recognized on the sale of an investment which was accounted for using the equity method; an $8.9 million realized gain recognized on the sale of a trading security; a $3.1 million gain for consideration received for the contribution of Marix; and a $2.8 million loss recognized on the sale of our residual interests. In 2015, we received and subsequently sold a trading security as consideration for the sale of the excess servicing spread associated with certain servicing rights.\nReverse Mortgage - Our Reverse Mortgage segment consists of operations that purchase and originate HECMs that are securitized, but remain on the consolidated balance sheet as collateral for secured borrowings. This segment performs servicing for third-party credit owners and the Company and provides other complementary services for the reverse mortgage market, such as real estate owned property management and disposition.\n \u2022 Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect non-cash compensation which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package; \nNet Servicing Revenue and Fees\n__________\nInterest Expense\n (2) Represents the provision for curtailment expense, net of expected third-party recoveries, related to historical practices at RMS which have led to increasing exposure for historical periods as regulatory requirements are clarified. Current practices have been revised in order to minimize current and future exposure to curtailable events. Our non-GAAP measures are not adjusted for accruals for current period curtailable events as such accruals are considered part of ongoing operating results of the business. \n (5) Average balance for mortgage-backed debt is calculated as the average carrying value at the beginning of each month during the year.  Goodwill Impairment\nOur servicing rights carried at fair value primarily consist of servicing rights acquired since January 1, 2013. The gain resulting from changes in valuation inputs or other assumptions of $153.3 million during 2013 was due primarily to overall reductions to assumed conditional prepayment rates and conditional default rates since the acquisitions of the related servicing rights. The decline in assumed conditional prepayment rates resulted primarily from a higher interest rate environment, which was partially offset by the impact of HARP being extended in April 2013 through December 2015 and the increase in the FHFA's housing price index. The decline in assumed conditional default rates was due primarily to actual performance and the addition of lower delinquency loans to our servicing portfolio. Assumed discount rates remained relatively flat since the acquisitions of servicing rights during 2013. The extension of HAMP in May 2013 to December 2015 also contributed to the change in valuation inputs and other assumptions given expected growth in incentive fees.\nIncentives relating to the performance of certain loan pools serviced by us decreased $9.1 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. Asset recovery income decreased by $5.1 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 as a result of lower gross collections due primarily to the runoff of the related loans managed by the Servicing segment. Modification fees and fees earned under HAMP increased $8.8 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due to a higher volume of completed modifications as well as successful maintenance of the modified loans under performing status.\nFollowing the housing downturn in 2008, national originations volume peaked in 2012 at more than $2.0 trillion, declining to approximately $1.8 trillion in 2013 and $1.3 trillion in 2014. However, the low interest rate environment in 2015 contributed to an estimated $1.7 trillion in originations in 2015. The 30-year conventional mortgage rate averaged approximately 3.85%, 4.17% and 3.98% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Conversely, in December 2015 the Federal Reserve announced its first increase in interest rates since 2006. As of February 19, 2016, our expectations based on market data are for mortgage originations to decrease approximately 10% to $1.5 trillion in 2016 as declining refinance volume more than offsets increasing home purchase volume. Based on such data, we believe refinance volumes may drop approximately 30% in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by rising interest rates, after increasing approximately 50% in 2015 compared to 2014. While the volume of originations tends to decline in a rising interest rate environment, the value of our servicing rights tend to rise as prepayments decrease.\n\nOther Revenues\n__________\nThe volume of our originations activity and changes in market rates primarily govern the fluctuations in revenues and expenses of our Originations segment. Provided below are summaries of our originations volume by channel (in thousands):\nDuring 2015, we added to the unpaid principal balance of our third-party mortgage loan servicing portfolio: $21.3 billion relating to acquired servicing rights, $7.3 billion relating to sub-servicing contracts and $18.6 billion relating to servicing rights capitalized upon sales of mortgage loans, while also adding $2.7 billion of unpaid principal balance to our third-party reverse loan servicing portfolio. Our third-party mortgage loan and reverse loan servicing portfolio was reduced by $39.5 billion of unpaid principal balance in payoffs and sales, net of recapture activities, during 2015. Also in 2015, we originated and purchased $1.4 billion in reverse mortgage volume and issued $1.5 billion in HMBS.\nThe decline in direct margin in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to a shift in volume from the higher margin retention channel to the lower margin correspondent channel and lower origination fees in 2014. In addition, 2014 includes the impact of lower direct expenses resulting from economies of scale and cost cutting initiatives established to align activities with the scope and scale of operations at such time.\nConvertible Notes\nWe recorded fair value losses on our servicing rights carried at fair value primarily as a result of higher discount rates used to value our servicing rights and higher realization of expected cash flows. We had lower interest income on loans primarily due to the sale of our residual interest in seven of the Residual Trusts in the second quarter of 2015. We had lower net fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations primarily due to the widening of spreads resulting from changes in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS and a lower reduction of LIBOR in 2015 as compared to 2014, offset partially by an increase in cash generated by origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs. We had lower net gains on sales of loans due primarily to a shift in volume from the higher margin retention channel to the lower margin correspondent channel, even though average interest rates were lower during 2015 as compared to 2014 and these lower rates gave rise to a higher total volume of locked loans.\nSalaries and benefits expense decreased $23.5 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a lower average headcount as a result of restructuring measures within our mortgage loan servicing operations, offset in part by severance incurred in relation to this restructuring. Headcount assigned directly to our Servicing segment decreased by approximately 600 full-time employees from 4,200 at December 31, 2014 to 3,600 at December 31, 2015.\nServicing fees increased $31.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to growth in the third-party servicing portfolio resulting from portfolio acquisitions and servicing rights capitalized as a result of our loan origination activities, partially offset by runoff of the servicing portfolio. Additionally there was a $13.1 million benefit recognized during 2014 from the settlement of differences in views between a prior servicer and the Company on how certain fees were recognized under a contract that was not recognized during the current year. Average loans serviced increased by $17.1 billion, or 8%, in 2015 as compared to 2014.\n\nSimilar to our mortgage loan servicing business, our reverse mortgage servicing agreements impose on us obligations to advance our own funds to meet contractual payment requirements for customers and credit owners and to pay protective advances, which are required to preserve the collateral underlying the residential loans being serviced. We rely upon operating cash flows to fund these obligations.\n\nRepresentations and Warranties\nHMBS Issuer Obligations\nProvided below is a summary of the average balances of residential loans carried at amortized cost and the related interest income and average yields (dollars in thousands):\nSimilar to 2014, the Company's share price continued to experience volatility during 2015. As a result, the Company reassessed its market capitalization and the implications that the decline in market capitalization had on the carrying value of its goodwill. Our October 1, 2015 analysis indicated that the carrying amount of our Servicing reporting unit's goodwill exceeded its implied fair value and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $151.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This impairment was primarily the result of higher discount rates applied to forecasted cash flows driven by the decline in our stock price, which has been impacted by continued challenges in our industry, market developments, as well as the impact these factors have had on certain Company specific matters. Refer to Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for further discussion regarding goodwill impairment.\nPrior to May 1, 2019, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon specified events and during specified periods, and, on or after May 1, 2019, at any time. The Convertible Notes will initially be convertible at a conversion rate of 17.0068 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $58.80 per share. Upon conversion, we may pay or deliver, at our option, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. It is our intent to settle all conversions through combination settlement, which involves payment of an amount of cash equal to the principal amount and any excess of conversion value over the principal amount in shares of common stock.\nWe incur interest expense on our corporate debt, mortgage-backed debt issued by the Residual Trusts, master repurchase agreements and servicing advance liabilities, all of which are accounted for at amortized cost. Interest expense decreased $29.5 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to decreases in interest expense related to mortgage-backed debt and servicing advance liabilities, partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to master repurchase agreements. Interest expense related to mortgage-backed debt decreased primarily as a result of the sale of our residual interests, which required the deconsolidation of the related mortgage-backed debt, and the runoff of the overall related mortgage loan portfolio. Interest expense related to servicing advance liabilities decreased due primarily to a lower average interest rate, offset partially by a higher average balance outstanding. Interest expense related to master repurchase agreements, which are utilized to fund purchases and originations of mortgage loans and reverse loans, increased primarily as a result of a higher average outstanding balance, which is due largely to a higher volume of mortgage loan fundings, partially offset by a lower average interest rate.\n (5) Includes the impact of the sale of servicing rights associated with 4,551 accounts and $968.4 million in unpaid principal balance during 2014. \nShare Repurchase Plan\nYear Ended December 31, 2015\nOur Industry and Operating Environment\n (3) Includes interest expense on servicing rights related liabilities, which represents the accretion of fair value, of $9.3 million and $4.9 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively.  2015 Compared to 2014\nA summary of net servicing revenue and fees for our Servicing segment is provided below (dollars in thousands):\n (1) Third-party servicing includes servicing rights capitalized, sub-servicing rights capitalized and sub-servicing rights not capitalized. Sub-servicing rights capitalized consist of contracts acquired through business combinations whereby the benefits from the contract are greater than adequate compensation for performing the servicing. Refer to Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nNet fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations include the contractual interest income earned on reverse loans, including those not yet securitized or bought out of securitization pools, net of interest expense on HMBS related obligations, and the change in fair value of these assets and liabilities. Refer to the Reverse Mortgage segment discussion under our Business Segment Results section below for additional information including a detailed breakout of the components of net fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations.\nRollforwards of reverse loan and real estate owned repurchase activity (by unpaid principal balance) are included below (in thousands):\nDuring 2015, we recognized a $4.7 million net gain on extinguishment of debt. We recognized a gain of $5.7 million related to the repurchase of Senior Notes with a carrying value of $35.7 million and an unpaid principal balance of $36.3 million for $30.0 million and a loss of $1.0 million related to the write-off of issue costs resulting from the voluntary payment of $50.0 million on the 2013 Term Loan.\nAn amount of up to $25.0 million under the 2013 Revolver is available to be used for the issuance of LOCs. Any amounts outstanding in issued LOCs reduce availability for cash borrowings under the 2013 Revolver. There have been no borrowings under the 2013 Revolver. At December 31, 2015, we had $0.3 million outstanding in an issued LOC with remaining availability under the 2013 Revolver of $124.7 million. The commitment fee on the unused portion of the 2013 Revolver is 0.50% per annum. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we made a voluntary payment of $50.0 million on our 2013 Term Loan that resulted in a loss on extinguishment of $1.0 million due to the write-off of the related issue costs. The loss on extinguishment is recorded in gains (losses) on extinguishments on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The balance outstanding on the 2013 Term Loan was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2015.\nOther revenues for our Other non-reportable segment consists primarily of asset management performance fees, and to a lesser extent, asset management advisory fees and other interest income. Other revenues decreased $35.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to $36.8 million in asset management performance fees collected and earned in connection with the asset management of a fund during 2014, partially offset by the settlement of a receivable that was repaid in conjunction with the sale of an investment accounted for using the equity method during 2015.\n (4) Represents the non-cash fair value adjustment to arrive at cash generated from reverse mortgage origination activities. \nTotal revenues for 2015 were $1.3 billion, which represented a decline of $212.9 million, or 14%, as compared to 2014. The decrease in revenue reflects a $107.2 million decrease in net servicing revenue and fees, primarily driven by $128.5 million in higher fair value losses on servicing rights; $60.2 million in lower interest income on loans; $11.7 million in lower net fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations; and $8.3 million in lower net gains on sales of loans.\nNet Gains on Sales of Loans\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included the benefit of higher margins from HARP, which is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2016. HARP is a federal program of the U.S. which helps homeowners refinance their mortgage. Our strategy includes significant efforts to maintain retention volumes through traditional refinancing opportunities and HARP, although we believe peak HARP refinancing already occurred in prior periods.\nProvided below are summaries of our funded volume, which represents purchases and originations of reverse loans, and volume of securitizations into HMBS (dollars in thousands):\n (3) Represents estimated settlement amounts for certain legal and regulatory matters outside of the normal course of business as well as legal costs and expenses associated with these matters. \nExecutive Summary\nOther revenues increased $27.9 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to $22.5 million in higher fair value gains relating to charged-off loans that were purchased during 2014 and $4.5 million in higher beneficial interest income related to a servicing asset.\nAs an HMBS issuer, we assume certain obligations related to each security issued. The most significant obligation is the requirement to purchase loans out of the Ginnie Mae securitization pools once the outstanding principal balance of the related HECM is equal to or greater than 98% of the maximum claim amount. Performing repurchased loans are conveyed to HUD and payment is received from HUD typically within 30 days of repurchase. Non-performing repurchased loans are generally liquidated through foreclosure and subsequent sale of real estate owned. Loans are considered non-performing upon events such as, but not limited to, the death of the mortgagor, the mortgagor no longer occupying the property as their principal residence, or the property taxes or insurance not being paid. We rely upon certain master repurchase agreements and operating cash flows, to the extent necessary, to repurchase loans. The timing and amount of our obligation to repurchase HECMs is uncertain as repurchase is predicated on certain factors such as whether or not a borrower event of default occurs prior to the HECM reaching the mandatory repurchase threshold under which we are obligated to repurchase the loan.\n\nHMBS related obligations increased $695.5 million due primarily to the securitization of reverse loans, partially offset by the repurchase of certain HECMs and real estate owned from securitization pools.\n__________\n\nProvided below is a summary of our Servicing segment's margin (in basis points):\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to (i) net income (loss) or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP or (ii) operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations of these metrics are:\nWe manage our Company in three reportable segments: Servicing, Originations, and Reverse Mortgage. A description of the business conducted by each of these segments is provided below:\nIntersegment Retention Revenue\nInterest Expense\nDeferred tax asset, net of $108.1 million in 2015 changed by $194.7 million from a deferred tax liability, net of $86.6 million in 2014. The change in deferred taxes was primarily a result of the current year operating loss, which increased the net operating loss carryforwards; the tax impact of the sale of our residual interests; differences in tax and GAAP bases and recovery methods for servicing rights; the sales of excess servicing spreads and servicing rights during the year; and an increase in the curtailment liability primarily related to the reverse mortgage business. These items were partially offset by decreases in accrued expenses related to legal and regulatory matters and tax amortization of deductible goodwill.\nWe funded the residential loan portfolio in the consolidated Residual Trusts through the securitization market. We record on our consolidated balance sheets the assets and liabilities, including mortgage-backed debt, of the Non-Residual Trusts as a result of certain obligations to exercise mandatory clean-up calls for each of these trusts at their earliest exercisable dates. The mortgage-backed debt issued by the Residual Trusts is accounted for at amortized cost. The mortgage-backed debt of the Non-Residual Trusts is accounted for at fair value. The total unpaid principal balance of mortgage-backed debt was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2015.\nOperational Efficiency\n__________\nThe change of $168.4 million from income tax expense in 2013 to an income tax benefit in 2014 was due primarily to the change from income before income taxes in 2013 to a loss before income taxes in 2014, offset by the impact on income taxes for non-deductible expenses such as the goodwill impairment. In addition, during 2014 we released $3.6 million from the aforementioned liability for unrecognized tax benefits associated with state and local taxes.\nSalaries and Benefits\nOther revenues, which consists primarily of origination fee income and interest on cash equivalents, increased $25.7 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, and decreased $16.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily as a result of lower origination fees in 2014 due to our having waived certain fees charged to borrowers refinancing mortgage loans.\nTotal revenues for 2014 were $1.5 billion, which represented a decline of $315.3 million, or 17%, as compared to 2013. The decrease in revenue reflects a $181.9 million decrease in net servicing revenue and fees, primarily driven by a $321.6 million decrease related to the change in fair value of servicing rights, partially offset by increased gross servicing revenue and fees of $143.0 million resulting from the growth in our servicing portfolio; a decrease of $136.8 million in net gains on sales of loans; and lower net fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations of $10.4 million. Other revenues increased $37.3 million due primarily to $36.8 million in performance fees earned by our investment management business in 2014.\n (1) Corporate debt includes our 2013 Term Loan, Senior Notes, and Convertible Notes. Corporate debt activities are included in the Other non-reportable segment. \nThe 2013 Secured Credit Facilities contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase our capital stock, make certain types of investments, create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries, incur certain liens, sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all of our assets to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The 2013 Secured Credit Facilities also contain customary events of default, including the failure to make timely payments on the 2013 Term Loan and 2013 Revolver or other material indebtedness, the failure to satisfy certain covenants and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency. We were in compliance with all covenants contained in our 2013 Secured Credit Facilities at December 31, 2015.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our business segments and funds available from our 2013 Revolver, master repurchase agreements, mortgage loan servicing advance facilities, issuance of HMBS and excess servicing spread financing arrangements. We may generate additional liquidity through sales of MSRs, any portion thereof, or other assets.\nTotal expenses for our Other non-reportable segment increased $10.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to higher salaries and benefits expense relating to increases in share-based compensation expense due largely to a higher number of awards granted and bonuses.\nWe are party to a servicer advance financing facility that provides funding for servicer and protective advances made by Ditech Financial in connection with its servicing of certain Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage loans. On October 21, 2015, this facility was amended and restated to provide for the issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of term notes consisting of Series 2015-T1 one-year term notes with an initial aggregate principal balance of $360.0 million and Series 2015-T2 three-year term notes with an initial aggregate principal balance of $140.0 million; to extend the commitment for up to $600.0 million of previously issued Series 2014-VF2 variable funding notes until October 2016; and to reduce total borrowing capacity under this facility by $100.0 million to $1.1 billion in the aggregate. The proceeds from the issuance of the Series 2015-T1 term notes and the Series 2015-T2 term notes were used to reduce the outstanding principal balance of the Series 2014-VF2 variable funding notes and to pay certain transaction fees, costs and expenses.\nInsurance Revenue\nExcess Servicing Spread Liabilities\nInsurance revenue consists of commission income and fees earned on voluntary and lender-placed insurance policies issued and other products sold to borrowers, net of estimated future policy cancellations. Commission income is based on a percentage of the premium of the insurance policy issued, which varies based on the type of policy. Insurance revenue decreased $23.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $13.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to a decrease in commissions earned related to lender-placed insurance policies resulting from regulatory changes and runoff of existing policies. Due to changes in GSE requirements and regulations that limited our ability to charge commissions for lender-placed insurance policies, our sales commissions related to lender-placed insurance policies began to decrease in June 2014. During 2014, these lower commissions were partially offset by commissions earned from an increase in lender-placed insurance policies issued prior to the effective date of the regulatory changes related to 2013 and early 2014 bulk servicing right acquisitions. In addition, in September 2015 we entered into an agreement to settle a litigation matter pursuant to which we have agreed not to receive commissions as a result of the placement of certain lender-placed insurance policies. We believe we have accrued the full amount expected to be paid under the settlement agreement at December 31, 2015. As a result of this settlement (and the potential sale of our insurance business), we expect a further reduction in our insurance revenues in 2016.\nNet interest income increased $5.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the growth in both reverse loans and HMBS related obligations, offset partially by the increase in nonperforming reverse loans which have lower interest rates than performing loans. Cash generated by origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs included in the change in fair value increased $10.0 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of a shift in volume from lower margin new originations to higher margin tails. Net non-cash fair value adjustments included in the change in fair value fluctuated by $26.9 million from a gain in 2014 to a loss in 2015 due primarily to a lower reduction of LIBOR in 2015 as compared to 2014. In addition, in 2015 the impact of the reduction of LIBOR was offset by the widening of spreads between reverse loans and HMBS related obligations resulting from changes in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS. In 2014 there was a tightening of spreads. The conditional repayment rate utilized in the valuation of reverse loans and HMBS related obligations has increased from 21.68% and 21.21% at December 31, 2014, respectively, to 25.59% and 24.70% at December 31, 2015, respectively, as the portfolio ages and recent regulatory guidance surrounding due and payable policies has resulted in shorter projected default servicing timelines.\nWe believe that, based on current forecasts and anticipated market conditions, our current liquidity, along with the funds generated from our principal sources of liquidity discussed above, will allow for financial flexibility to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund operating needs and expenses, servicing advances, loan originations and repurchases of mortgage loans and HECMs, planned capital expenditures, current committed business and asset acquisitions, and all required debt service obligations for the next 12 months. We expect that significant acquisitions of servicing rights and other opportunities to grow by acquisition would need to be funded primarily through, or in collaboration with, external capital sources. Our operating cash flows and liquidity are significantly influenced by numerous factors, including interest rates and continued availability of financing. Our liquidity outlook assumes the renewal of existing mortgage loan servicing advance facilities, mortgage loan and reverse loan master repurchase agreements and reverse loan master repurchase agreements to fund repurchases of HECMs. In addition, management from time to time pursues other financing facilities. We may access the capital markets from time to time, in public or in private transactions, to augment our liquidity position, fund growth opportunities or for other reasons. We continually monitor our cash flows and liquidity in order to be responsive to changing conditions.\nGoodwill decreased $207.6 million due to a non-cash impairment charge to the asset carrying value recorded during the second and fourth quarters of 2015. The impairment testing is performed on each of our reporting units on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. At June 30, 2015, our analysis indicated impairment of the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit's goodwill, and as such we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $56.5 million. The primary cause of the goodwill impairment in the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit was the decline in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as a result of operational challenges in its retail origination channel; a reduction in opportunities for additional sub-servicing business; a greater than originally anticipated deferral of cash flows to future years with respect to previously introduced product changes; recent regulatory developments that could impact the likelihood of curtailment events in future periods; increasing liquidity requirements for the repurchase of certain HECMs and real estate owned from Ginnie Mae securitization pools; and an increase in obligations surrounding curtailment-related items existing at the time of the RMS acquisition. These factors resulted in reduced and delayed cash flows in the reverse mortgage business.\n\nRegulatory Developments\nYear Ended December 31, 2014\nThe overall delinquencies associated with our third-party servicing portfolio decreased at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 primarily because the new loans we originated and acquired have experienced a lower delinquency rate than our historical servicing portfolio had experienced.\n__________\nTotal expenses for our Other non-reportable segment decreased $3.4 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to $30.4 million in lower general and administrative and allocated indirect expenses largely resulting from costs incurred to affect corporate debt financing transactions in 2013. Our corporate debt transactions during 2013 included incremental borrowings under our 2012 Term Loan, the related subsequent refinancing activities under our 2013 Term Loan and the issuance of our Senior Notes. The decrease in expenses was partially offset by a $24.3 million increase in interest expense on corporate debt resulting from these corporate debt transactions. These financing transactions resulted in a higher average balance of corporate debt of $502.9 million, partially offset by a lower average interest rate of 48 basis points, which resulted in a lower cost of debt.\nAdjusted Earnings is defined as income (loss) before income taxes plus changes in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs and other assumptions; certain depreciation and amortization costs related to the increased basis in assets (including servicing rights and sub-servicing contracts) acquired within business combination transactions (or step-up depreciation and amortization); goodwill impairment, if any; the provision for curtailment expense, net of expected third-party recoveries, as described in footnote two to the Adjusted Earnings table below; share-based compensation expense; non-cash interest expense; restructuring costs; estimated settlements and costs for certain legal and regulatory matters; fair value to cash adjustments for reverse loans; and select other cash and non-cash adjustments primarily including certain non-recurring costs; severance; gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; the net impact of the Non-Residual Trusts; and transaction and integration costs. Adjusted Earnings excludes unrealized changes in fair value of MSRs that are based on projections of expected future cash flows and prepayments. Adjusted Earnings includes both cash and non-cash gains from mortgage loan origination activities. Non-cash gains are net of non-cash charges or reserves provided. Adjusted Earnings includes cash generated from reverse mortgage origination activities. Adjusted Earnings may from time to time also include other adjustments, as applicable based upon facts and circumstances, consistent with the intent of providing investors with a supplemental means of evaluating our operating performance.\nOur cash flows used in operating activities were $48.1 million during 2015. We finished 2015 with $202.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. Cash used in operating activities decreased by $156.2 million during 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of an increase in cash related to changes in assets and liabilities, including higher collections of servicer and protective advances and an increase in accrued expenses related to uncertain tax positions, partially offset by higher settlements of payables relating to servicer and protective advances acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of servicing rights and a decrease in accrued expenses related to legal and regulatory matters. In addition, cash increased due to proceeds received from the sale of a trading security received as consideration for the sale of the excess servicing spread associated with certain servicing rights. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash related to a lower volume of loans sold in relation to originated loans.\nOur servicing rights related liabilities have been excluded from the table above as repayment is based on future servicing fees received from residential loans underlying the servicing rights.\nIn July 2014, we completed an excess servicing spread transaction with WCO whereby we sold 70% of the excess servicing spread from a pool of servicing rights, with an unpaid principal balance of $25.2 billion, to WCO for a sales price of $75.4 million. In November 2015, we completed an additional excess servicing spread transaction with WCO whereby we sold 100% of excess servicing spread from a pool of servicing rights, with an unpaid principal balance of $7.5 billion, to WCO for a sales price of $46.8 million. We recognized the proceeds from the sales of the excess servicing spreads as financing arrangements. We elected to record the excess servicing spread liabilities at fair value similar to the related servicing rights. At December 31, 2015, the carrying value of our excess servicing spread liabilities was $100.1 million, the repayment of which is based on future servicing fees received from the residential loans underlying the servicing rights.\nOur servicing agreements impose on us various rights and obligations that affect our liquidity. Among the most significant of these obligations is the requirement that we advance our own funds to pay taxes, insurance and foreclosure costs and various other items, referred to as protective advances. Protective advances are required to preserve the collateral underlying the residential loans being serviced. In addition, we advance our own funds to meet contractual payment requirements for credit owners. As a result of bulk servicing right acquisitions in 2013 and 2014, we experienced and continue to incur an elevated level of advance requirements. Sub-servicers are generally reimbursed for advances in the month following the advance, so our advance funding requirements may be reduced if we succeed in increasing the fee-for-service mix in our servicing portfolio. In the normal course of business, we borrow money from various counterparties who provide us with financing to fund a portion of our mortgage loan related servicing advances on a short-term basis or provide for reimbursement within an agreed-upon period. Our ability to fund servicing advances is a significant factor that affects our liquidity, and to operate and grow our servicing portfolio we depend upon our ability to secure these types of arrangements on acceptable terms and to renew or replace existing financing facilities as they expire. However, there can be no assurance that these facilities will be available to us in the future. The servicing advance financing agreements that support our servicing operations are discussed below.\nInterest Expense\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $1.1 billion outstanding under all servicing advance facilities which have an aggregate capacity of $1.3 billion. The servicing advance facilities contain customary events of default and covenants, including financial covenants. Financial covenants most sensitive to our operating results and financial position are the requirements that a subsidiary maintain minimum tangible net worth, indebtedness to tangible net worth and minimum liquidity. Our subsidiary was in compliance with these financial covenants at December 31, 2015.\nOther Gains (Losses)\nGoodwill Impairment\nAdjusted EBITDA margin decreased three basis points in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to lower revenues (adjusted for the impact of the change in fair value) per loan serviced which primarily resulted from the decline in incentive and performance fees, intersegment retention revenue and insurance revenue.\nAdjusted Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA decreased $48.9 million and $48.8 million, respectively, in 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease in these non-GAAP financial measures was due primarily to the decline in cash generated from origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs\nRollforwards of the liability associated with representations and warranties are included below (in thousands):\nSalaries and Benefits\n (7) Unfunded commitments presented under indeterminate maturity above represents the aggregate unfunded borrowing capacity of borrowers under our reverse loans at December 31, 2015. This amount includes $868.3 million in capacity that was available to be drawn by borrowers at December 31, 2015 and $475.9 million in capacity that will become eligible to be drawn by borrowers throughout 2016 assuming the loans remain performing. There is no termination date for these drawings so long as the loan remains performing. \nOriginations\n (2) Consists of $194.8 billion and $49.3 billion in unpaid principal balance associated with servicing and sub-servicing contracts, respectively, at December 31, 2015 and $179.7 billion and $55.2 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2014. \nExpenses\n\nInterest Income on Loans\nOther - Our Other non-reportable segment primarily consists of the assets and liabilities of the Non-Residual Trusts, corporate debt and our asset management business, which we operate through GTIM.\nOther Gains (Losses)\nNet Servicing Revenue and Fees\nA summary of net servicing revenue and fees is provided below (dollars in thousands):\nOur results of operations are also affected by expenses such as salaries and benefits, information technology, occupancy, legal and professional fees, the provision for advances, curtailment, interest expense and other operating expenses. In addition, during 2015 and 2014, our expenses were impacted by non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $207.6 million and $82.3 million, respectively. Refer to the Financial Highlights, Results of Operations and Business Segment Results sections below for further information.\nOur profitability is dependent on our ability to generate revenue, primarily from our servicing and originations businesses. Our Servicing segment revenue is primarily impacted by the size and mix of our capitalized servicing and sub-servicing portfolios and is generated through servicing of mortgage loans for clients and/or credit owners. Net servicing revenue and fees includes the change in fair value of servicing rights carried at fair value and the amortization of all other servicing rights. Our servicing fee income generation is influenced by the level and timing of entrance into sub-servicing contracts and purchases and sales of servicing rights. The fair value of our servicing rights is largely dependent on the size of the related portfolio, discount rates and prepayment and default speeds. Our Originations segment revenue, which is primarily gains on sales of loans, is impacted by interest rates and the volume of loans locked as well as the margins earned in our various origination channels. Gains on sales of loans include the cost of additions to the representations and warranties reserve. Our Reverse Mortgage segment is impacted by new origination reverse loan volume, draws on existing reverse loans and the fair value of reverse loans and HMBS.\n (1) Volume has been adjusted by the percentage of mortgage loans not expected to close based on previous historical experience and changes in interest rates. \nIn December 2013, we completed the sale of $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, which pay interest semi-annually at an interest rate of 7.875% and mature on December 15, 2021. The balance outstanding on the Senior Notes was $528.3 million at December 31, 2015.\nNet gains on sales of loans include realized and unrealized gains and losses on loans held for sale, fair value adjustments on IRLCs and other related freestanding derivatives, values of the initial capitalized servicing rights, and a provision for the repurchase of loans. Net gains on sales of loans decreased $8.3 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $136.8 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of a shift in volume from the higher margin retention channel to the lower margin correspondent channel, partially offset by higher volumes of locked loans.\n (4) Average balance for corporate debt, servicing advance liabilities and master repurchase agreements is calculated as the average daily carrying value. \nServicing\nOur total assets and total liabilities decreased by $358.1 million and $86.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014. The most significant changes in assets and liabilities are described below.\nAncillary and other fees increased $11.7 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to growth in the servicing portfolio.\nServicing Advance Liabilities\nThe reverse mortgage sector has seen significant change in the past several years. Several of the largest reverse mortgage originators have left the industry and there have been significant changes made by the FHA and Ginnie Mae to the products offered, underwriting guidelines and servicing protocols. Loan volumes have been in decline over the last several years. According to an industry source, we believe HECM endorsements, which represent the insuring of loans by the FHA, will decrease slightly in 2016 and begin to grow in 2017 through 2022 based on forecasts of home pricing and the senior population. We believe the growth in endorsements is an indicator that reverse loan originations are expected to increase.\nSalaries and benefits expense remained flat in 2015 as compared to 2014. Although level between both years, 2015 had a decrease in compensation and benefits primarily due to lower average headcount and lower severance due mainly to the exit from the wholesale business in February 2014 and an office closure in 2014. These lower expenses were offset by higher incentives in 2015 due to an increase in funded volume, partially offset by the impact from the change in mix from higher incentive paying retention originations to lower incentive paying correspondent originations.\nThe Senior Notes Indenture contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, limits our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase our capital stock, make certain types of investments, create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries, incur certain liens, sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all of our assets to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. The Senior Notes Indenture also contains customary events of default, including the failure to make timely payments on the Senior Notes or other material indebtedness, the failure to satisfy certain covenants and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency. We were in compliance with all covenants contained in the Senior Notes Indenture at December 31, 2015.\nNet fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations decreased $11.7 million during 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to the widening of spreads resulting from changes in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS and a lower reduction of LIBOR in 2015 as compared to 2014, offset partially by an increase in cash generated by origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs.\nInterest Income on Loans\nStrategy\nIncentive and performance fees include modification fees, fees earned under HAMP, asset recovery income, and other incentives. Modification fees and fees earned under HAMP decreased $30.4 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to a lower volume of completed modifications and lower fees for maintenance of performing modified loans no longer eligible for HAMP incentive fees. We expect to modify fewer loans in the future as a result of the scheduled termination of HAMP in December 2016 and there being a fewer number of loans in our servicing portfolio eligible for modification. In addition, asset recovery income decreased $7.9 million for 2015 as compared to 2014 as a result of lower gross collections due primarily to the runoff of the related loans managed by the Servicing segment. Incentives relating to the performance of certain loan pools serviced by us decreased $2.8 million for 2015 as compared to 2014. We expect incentives relating to the performance of loan pools serviced by us to continue to decline as a result of market and other factors, including changes in incentive programs, runoff of the related loan portfolio and improving economic conditions, which may reduce the opportunity to earn these incentives.\nEarly Advance Reimbursement Agreement\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.1 million and $13.3 million, respectively, in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to higher origination fee income, offset partially by lower net gains on sales of loans and higher expenses. We had a higher net provision for the repurchase of loans due primarily to a shift in volume of originations from the retention channel to the correspondent channel, which has a higher estimated defect rate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNet gains on sales of loans for our Originations segment consists of the following (dollars in thousands):\nSalaries and benefits increased $28.8 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in the number of employees as a result of hiring to support the growth of our servicing business and corporate operations. Headcount increased by approximately 300 full-time employees from approximately 6,400 at December 31, 2013 to approximately 6,700 at December 31, 2014.\n__________\nTotal expenses for 2014 were $1.6 billion, which represented an increase of $241.8 million, or 17%, as compared to 2013. The increase in expenses was primarily driven by the growth in our servicing portfolio coupled with an increased provision for uncollectible advances and increased costs for legal and regulatory matters outside of normal course of business, and an $82.3 million goodwill impairment charge recorded by our Reverse Mortgage reporting unit. In addition, interest expense increased $30.4 million primarily resulting from increased average corporate debt outstanding and increased servicing advance liabilities.\nIn 2015, in connection with our focus on efficient use of capital, we monetized certain non-core assets. In April 2015, we sold the residual interests in seven of the Residual Trusts and in the first quarter of 2015 we sold an equity method investment, as described in Business Segment Results. Further, we continue to work on a potential sale of substantially all of our insurance business. There can be no assurance this potential sale will be consummated. We may consider other asset sale opportunities if they arise.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nIn calculating income (loss) before income taxes for our segments, we allocate indirect expenses to our business segments. Indirect expenses are allocated to our Servicing, Originations, Reverse Mortgage and certain non-reportable segments based on headcount.\nServicing advance liabilities, which are utilized to finance servicer and protective advances, decreased $136.6 million primarily as a result of collections of servicer and protective advances, which are used to settle balances outstanding.\nAs market conditions warrant, we may from time to time, subject to limitations as stated in our 2013 Secured Credit Facilities, repurchase debt securities issued by us, in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.\nFinancing Transactions\nWe manage our Company in three reportable segments: Servicing, Originations and Reverse Mortgage. We measure the performance of our business segments through the following measures: income (loss) before income taxes, Adjusted Earnings, and Adjusted EBITDA. Management considers Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA, both non-GAAP financial measures, to be important in the evaluation of our business segments and of the Company as a whole, as well as for allocating capital resources to our segments. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental metrics utilized by management to assess the underlying key drivers and operational performance of the continuing operations of the business. In addition, analysts, investors, and creditors may use these measures when analyzing our operating performance. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and our use of these measures and terms may vary from other companies in our industry.\n\nGeneral and administrative and allocated indirect expenses decreased $17.4 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the management of expenses to align with the scope and scale of operations in 2014, partially offset by a higher volume of loans funded during 2014 coupled with a full year of mortgage loan originations activity in 2014 as compared to a condensed period in 2013.\nServicing Rights Related Liabilities\nOur representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits of exposure with the exception of certain loans originated under HARP, which limits exposure based on payment history of the loan. At December 31, 2015, our maximum exposure to repurchases due to potential breaches of representations and warranties was $51.3 billion, and was based on the original unpaid principal balance of loans sold from the beginning of 2013 through the year ended December 31, 2015 adjusted for voluntary payments made by the borrower on loans for which we perform the servicing. A majority of our loan sales were servicing retained.\nSalaries and benefits expense increased $11.7 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to a larger average headcount during the current year, higher incentives and higher severance. Salaries and benefits expense remained relatively flat in in 2014 as compared to 2013. As a result of an increase in defaulted loans and recent regulatory guidance surrounding due and payable policies which have resulted in shorter projected default servicing timelines, we have increased our headcount of employees dedicated to such servicing.\nOther Revenues\nInsurance revenue decreased $23.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $13.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of changes in GSE requirements and regulations that limited our ability to charge commissions for lender-placed insurance policies during 2014 that led to a decrease in our sales commissions related to lender-placed insurance policies beginning in June 2014 as well as runoff of existing policies. During 2014, these lower commissions were partially offset by commissions earned from an increase in lender-placed insurance policies issued prior to the effective date of the regulatory changes related to the 2013 and early 2014 bulk servicing right acquisitions.\nReverse Mortgage Business\n\n__________\n (4) Amounts presented are net of loan sales associated with servicing retained multi-channel recapture activities of $6.4 billion and $8.8 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. \n\n__________\nAt December 31, 2015, we serviced 2.2 million residential loans with a total unpaid principal balance of $266.6 billion. We have been one of the 10 largest residential loan servicers in the U.S by unpaid principal balance for the past three years according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Our originations business originated $25.1 billion in mortgage loan volume in 2015, ranking it in the top 20 originators nationally by unpaid principal balance according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Our reverse mortgage business is a leading integrated franchise in the reverse mortgage sector and, according to an industry source, was the third leading issuer of HMBS in 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOther revenues increased $29.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to the aforementioned $36.8 million in asset management performance fees, partially offset by a decline in asset management advisory fees.\nWe have a $1.5 billion 2013 Term Loan and a $125.0 million 2013 Revolver. Our obligations under the 2013 Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our assets subject to certain exceptions, such as the assets of the consolidated Residual and Non-Residual Trusts and consolidated financing entities, as well as the residential loans and real estate owned of the Ginnie Mae securitization pools that have been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2013\nServicing Rights Financing\nOur mortgage loan and reverse mortgage originations businesses diversify our revenue base and offer various sources for replenishing and growing the Company's servicing portfolio. During 2015, we originated and purchased $25.1 billion of mortgage loans, substantially all of which were added to our servicing portfolio upon loan sale. Of these originations, we added $17.6 billion of unpaid principal balance to our servicing portfolio through our correspondent channel. The majority of the remaining originations resulted from our retention activities associated with our existing servicing portfolio. Through our retention activities, we assist consumers in refinancing their loans, which reduces the runoff on our existing servicing portfolio.\nAdjusted Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA\n\nDitech Financial's Early Advance Reimbursement Agreement with Fannie Mae is used exclusively to fund certain principal and interest, servicer and protective advances that are the responsibility of Ditech Financial under its Fannie Mae servicing agreements. This agreement was renewed in April 2015 and now expires in March 2016. If not renewed, there will be no additional funding by Fannie Mae of new advances under the agreement. In addition, collections recovered during the 18 months following the expiration of the agreement are to be remitted to Fannie Mae to settle any remaining outstanding balance due under such agreement. Upon expiration of the 18 month period, any remaining balance would become due and payable. At December 31, 2015, we had borrowings of $156.7 million under the Early Advance Reimbursement Agreement, which has a capacity of $200.0 million.\n\n__________\n \u2022 Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; \nOn or prior to December 15, 2016, we may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at 107.875% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date. Prior to December 15, 2016, we may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a make-whole premium plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as of the redemption date.\n\nAdjusted Earnings margin decreased six basis points in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower revenues (adjusted for the impact of the change in fair value driven by changes in valuation inputs) per loan serviced, partially offset by lower expenses, primarily salaries and benefits, per loan serviced and a net gain resulting from the sale of a trading security and the sale of our residual interests. The decline in revenues per loan serviced is primarily due to the increase in realization of expected cash flows due mainly to faster prepayment speeds than anticipated and a larger servicing portfolio, and the decline in incentive and performance fees and insurance revenue.\nOther Net Fair Value Gains\n (5) Represents the non-cash fair value adjustment to arrive at cash generated from reverse mortgage origination activities. \nOn or after December 15, 2016, we may on any one or more occasions redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 105.906% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as of the redemption date, such optional redemption prices decreasing to 103.938% on or after December 15, 2017, 101.969% on or after December 15, 2018 and 100.000% on or after December 15, 2019.\nThe increase in servicing rights carried at fair value at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 related primarily to $544.6 million in servicing right portfolio acquisitions and servicing rights capitalized upon sales of loans, partially offset by a reduction in fair value of $402.0 million and sales of servicing rights of $60.1 million. The reduction in fair value of these servicing rights in 2015 was attributed to a loss of $157.3 million in changes in valuation inputs or other assumptions and a loss of $244.7 million in other changes in fair value which reflect the impact of the realization of expected cash flows resulting from both regularly scheduled and unscheduled payments and payoffs of loan principal.\nAdjusted Earnings\n (4) Restructuring costs include expenses related to the closing of offices and the termination of certain employees as well as other expenses to institute efficiencies. Restructuring costs incurred in 2015 to improve efficiencies within the organization included re-branding the mortgage loan originations business by consolidating Ditech Mortgage Corp and Green Tree Servicing into one legal entity with one brand, Ditech, a Walter Company, and measures taken to restructure the mortgage loan servicing operations and improve the profitability of the reverse mortgage business by streamlining its geographic footprint and strengthening its retail originations channel. These costs also include those relating to our exit from the consumer retail channel of the Originations segment. \n (8) Our Early Advance Reimbursement Agreement and servicing advance facilities above are included in servicing advance liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Collections of advances that have been reimbursed under the Early Advance Reimbursement Agreement require remittance upon collection to settle the outstanding balance. We are required to remit 60% to 85% of advances reimbursed under the servicing advance facilities to settle the balance outstanding under the agreements.  We exclude from the table above the amounts due under the Receivables Loan Agreement and the Indenture Agreement, which are included in servicing advance liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The Receivables Loan Agreement and the Indenture Agreement are non-recourse to us. Payments under these facilities are required upon collection of the underlying advances that have been reimbursed under the agreement.\nServicing Advance Facilities\nEach series of term notes and variable funding notes were issued in four classes. Interest on the term notes is based on a fixed rate per annum ranging from approximately 2.30% to 3.93% for the Series 2015-T1 term notes and 3.09% to 4.67% for the Series 2015-T2 term notes. The interest on the variable funding notes is based on one-month LIBOR, (or, in certain circumstances, the higher of (i) the prime rate and (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%) plus a per annum margin ranging from approximately 2.34% to 4.36%.\nWe incurred a $151.0 million impairment charge during 2015 as a result of a goodwill evaluation performed in the fourth quarter of 2015. The evaluation indicated the estimated implied fair value of the Servicing reporting unit's goodwill at the evaluation date was less than its book value, therefore requiring the impairment charge.\n (2) Average servicing fee is calculated by dividing gross servicing fees by the average unpaid principal balance of loans serviced.  The decrease in average servicing fee of one basis point for 2015 as compared to 2014, as well as the increase in average servicing fee of one basis point for 2014 as compared to 2013, related primarily to a benefit of $13.1 million recognized during 2014 from the settlement of differences in views between a prior servicer and the Company on how certain fees were recognized under a contract.\nProvided below are summaries of the activity in our mortgage loan servicing portfolio (dollars in thousands):\n (3) Includes $0.5 million in capital leases scheduled to mature in less than 1 year and included in corporate debt on the consolidated balance sheets. \nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we consolidated Ditech Mortgage Corp and Green Tree Servicing into one legal entity, Ditech Financial, with one brand, Ditech, a Walter Company. We believe this rebranding and consolidation will allow for greater focus on our consumers, will enhance brand recognition as mortgage loans originated by Ditech Financial will be serviced by the same brand, will simplify the process and improve quality for the consumer and will provide us with greater opportunities to cross-sell. We are focused on increasing our recapture rates from the serviced portfolio and believe the enhanced brand recognition will contribute to improving our recapture performance. The consolidation will also enable us to better leverage our resources and talent across the businesses and is expected to drive operational efficiencies. In addition, we exited the Originations segment's consumer retail channel in January 2016 and have focused on developing our Originations segment's consumer direct channel. Further, we have made and are continuing to make investments in technology which are designed to facilitate the originations process for borrowers.\nMortgage-Backed Debt\nThe change in estimate of existing reserves during 2014 is due primarily to timely payment history on loans originated under HARP and lower history of actual origination defects as compared to original expectation.\nMortgage Loan Originations Business\nServicing Rights Related Liabilities\nOther revenues include originations fee income and other miscellaneous income. Other revenues declined $4.9 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $3.6 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the decline in origination fee income resulting from fewer originations. In addition, during 2015 we charged lower fees to new borrowers.\nDuring 2015, we undertook a number of actions designed to strengthen the capital structure of the Company. These actions included the repurchase of approximately 2.4 million shares of common stock under our publicly announced repurchase authorization, the repurchase of Senior Notes with a carrying value of $35.7 million and a voluntary payment of $50.0 million on the 2013 Term Loan. We intend to pursue opportunities designed to further strengthen the Company's capital structure through the efficient deployment of capital generated from contemplated future actions including the aforementioned potential sale of the insurance business, potential sales of mortgage servicing rights or excess servicing spread or other similar assets, as well as cash generated from our operations.\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay debt and meet the financial obligations of our operations including funding acquisitions; mortgage loan and reverse loan servicing advances; obligations associated with the repurchase of reverse loans from securitization pools; funding additional borrowing capacity on reverse loans; origination of mortgage loans; and other general business needs, including the cost of compliance with changing legislation and related rules. Our liquidity is measured as our consolidated cash and cash equivalents excluding subsidiary minimum cash requirement balances, which are typically associated with our servicer licensing or financing agreements with third parties. This measure also includes our borrowing capacity available under the 2013 Revolver, as described under the Corporate Debt section below. At December 31, 2015, our liquidity was $256.7 million. At December 31, 2015, we had contractual obligations, subject to certain conditions and adjustments, to utilize approximately $27.7 million of this amount to fund acquisitions of servicing rights, including related servicer and protective advances, and certain payment obligations under our asset purchase agreement with RCS.\n\n (2) Calculated on funded volume.  The decline in direct margin in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to a shift in volume from the higher margin retention channel to the lower margin correspondent channel. This decline was partially offset by higher origination fees in 2015, the impact of lower direct expenses as a result of the exit from the wholesale business in February 2014, economies of scale as a result of higher loan volume and other cost cutting measures in 2014 and 2015.\nIn October 2012, we closed on a registered underwritten public offering of $290.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes pay interest semi-annually on May 1 and November 1, commencing on May 1, 2013, at a rate of 4.50% per annum, and mature on November 1, 2019.\nNet gains on sales of loans include realized and unrealized gains and losses on loans, the initial fair value of the capitalized servicing rights upon loan sales, as well as the changes in fair value of our IRLCs and other freestanding derivatives. The amount of net gains on sales of loans is a function of the volume and margin of our originations activity and is impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. A substantial portion of our gains on sales of loans is recognized at the time we commit to originate or purchase a loan at specified terms, as we recognize the value of the IRLC at the time of commitment. The fair value of the IRLC includes our estimate of the fair value of the servicing right we expect to receive upon sale of the loan. We recognize loan origination costs as incurred, which typically align with the date of loan funding for consumer originations and the date of loan purchase for correspondent lending. These expenses are primarily included in general and administrative expenses and salaries and benefits on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). In addition, we record a provision for losses relating to representations and warranties made as part of the loan sale transaction at the time the loan is sold.\n (2) Consists of activities associated with servicing and sub-servicing contracts. \nBorrower remittances received on the reverse loans, if any, and proceeds received from the sale of real estate owned and our funds used to repurchase reverse loans are used to reduce the HMBS related obligations by making payments to Ginnie Mae, who will then remit the payments to the holders of the HMBS. The maturity of the HMBS related obligations is directly affected by the liquidation of the reverse loans or liquidation of real estate owned and events of default as stipulated in the reverse loan agreements with borrowers. Refer to the below for additional information on repurchases of reverse loans.\n (1) Represents the net change in servicing rights carried at fair value resulting primarily from market-driven changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds. \nOther Non-Reportable\nWe recognized total other gains of $33.1 million in 2015, which include an $11.8 million gain recognized on the sale of an investment which was accounted for using the equity method; an $8.9 million realized gain recognized on the sale of a trading security; a $7.3 million net fair value gain relating to the Non-Residual Trusts; a $4.7 million net gain on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of Senior Notes and the voluntary prepayment on the 2013 Term Loan; a $3.1 million gain for consideration received for the contribution of Marix to WCO; and a $2.8 million loss recognized on the sale of our residual interest in seven of the Residual Trusts.\nOther Revenues\nWhile we had growth in both reverse loans and HMBS related obligations in 2014 as compared to 2013, we also had an increase in nonperforming reverse loans, which have lower interest rates than performing loans and as a result, net interest income was relatively flat. Cash generated by origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs included in the change in fair value decreased $53.9 million primarily as a result of lower margin new originations, partially offset by higher margin tails. Net non-cash fair value adjustments included in the change in fair value increased favorably by $42.6 million due to a reduction of LIBOR and the tightening of spreads between reverse loans and HMBS related obligations resulting from changes in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS.\n (2) Represents estimated settlement amounts for certain legal and regulatory matters outside of the normal course of business as well as legal costs and expenses associated with these matters. \nTotal other gains of $20.1 million in 2014 increased $25.8 million from total other losses of $5.8 million in 2013 due primarily to a loss on extinguishment of debt of $12.5 million incurred in 2013, $8.6 million in higher fair value gains on the Non-Residual Trusts in 2014 resulting from the aforementioned reduction to discount rates, and a $4.8 million loss incurred in 2013 related to an increase in the contingent earn-out liability related to a business acquisition.\nNet fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations decreased $10.4 million during 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to lower cash generated by origination, purchase and securitization of HECMs, offset partially by the tightening of spreads from changes in market pricing for HECMs and HMBS and a reduction of LIBOR.\nNet gains on sales of loans for the Company includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on loans as well as the changes in fair value of our IRLCs and other freestanding derivatives. A substantial portion of our gain on sales of loans is recognized at the time we commit to originate or purchase a loan at specified terms as we recognize the value of the IRLC at the time of commitment. The fair value of the IRLC includes our estimate of the fair value of the servicing right we expect to receive upon sale of the loan.\nProvided below are summaries of the activity in our third-party servicing portfolio for our reverse mortgage business, which includes accounts serviced for third parties for which we earn servicing revenue and, thus, excludes servicing performed related to reverse loans and real estate owned that have been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets, as the reverse loan transfer was accounted for as a secured borrowing (dollars in thousands):\nThe Servicing segment receives intercompany servicing fees related to on-balance sheet assets of the Originations segment and the Other non-reportable segment. Provided below are summaries of the composition of our mortgage loan servicing portfolio (dollars in thousands): \n (4) HMBS related obligations have no stated maturity. The maturity of HMBS related obligations is directly affected by the liquidation of the reverse loans or liquidation of real estate owned, including voluntary liquidation on behalf of the borrower, and events of default as stipulated in the reverse loan agreements with borrowers. Refer to the HMBS Issuer Obligations section above for HECM and real estate owned repurchase activity, which would exclude voluntary liquidations made on behalf of the borrower, during 2015 and 2014. There is no repurchase activity in instances where proceeds from voluntary liquidations are made on behalf of the borrower as such proceeds are used to settle the associated HMBS related obligation. \nWe transfer reverse loans that we have originated or purchased through the Ginnie Mae HMBS issuance process. The proceeds from the transfer of the HMBS are accounted for as a secured borrowing and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets as HMBS related obligations. The proceeds from the transfer are used to repay borrowings under our master repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2015, we had $10.0 billion in unpaid principal balance outstanding on the HMBS related obligations. At December 31, 2015, $10.0 billion in unpaid principal balance of reverse loans and real estate owned was pledged as collateral to the HMBS beneficial interest holders, and are not available to satisfy the claims of our creditors. Ginnie Mae, as guarantor of the HMBS, is obligated to the holders of the HMBS in an instance of RMS default on its servicing obligations, or when the proceeds realized on HECMs are insufficient to repay all outstanding HMBS related obligations. Ginnie Mae has recourse to RMS in connection with certain claims relating to the performance and obligations of RMS as both an issuer of HMBS and a servicer of HECMs underlying HMBS.\n__________\n__________\nIncome tax benefit increased $132.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to the increase in loss before income taxes offset by the impact on income taxes for non-deductible expenses such as the impairment of goodwill of the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit. These items were partially offset by a lower release of uncertain tax positions associated with state and local taxes due to a lapse in the statute of limitations from $3.6 million in 2014 to $2.1 million in 2015.\n (2) The average principal balance of loans serviced utilized in the calculation of the Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes adjustments related to servicing fee economics to reflect servicing right acquisitions closed during certain quarters as though they were closed at the beginning of the quarter, as economics (cash flows) were actually recorded for the full quarter. \nWe exclude mortgage-backed debt from the contractual obligations disclosed in the table above as this debt is non-recourse and not cross-collateralized and, therefore\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2015, two of Ditech Financial's master repurchase agreements were amended to allow for a net loss under their respective minimum profitability covenants. Without these amendments, Ditech Financial would not have been in compliance with these covenants for the quarter ended December 31, 2015.\nCapital Efficiency\nGeneral and Administrative and Allocated Indirect Expenses\n__________\nRefer to the Results of Operations and Business Segment Results sections below for further information on the changes addressed above. Also included in the Business Segment Results section is a discussion of changes in our non-GAAP financial measures. A description of our non-GAAP financial measures is included in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased Senior Notes with a carrying value of $35.7 million and an unpaid principal balance of $36.3 million for $30.0 million that resulted in a gain on extinguishment of $5.7 million, which is recorded in gains (losses) on extinguishments on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nIntersegment Retention Expense\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA\nSalaries and Benefits\nWe have four servicing advance facilities through several lenders and an Early Advance Reimbursement Agreement with Fannie Mae which, in each case, are used to fund servicer and protective advances that are our responsibility under certain servicing agreements. The servicing advance facilities and the Early Advance Reimbursement Agreement had an aggregate capacity amount of $1.5 billion at December 31, 2015. The interest rates are either fixed or are primarily based on LIBOR plus between 2.30% and 4.40% and have various expiration dates through October 2018. Payments on the amounts due under these agreements are paid from proceeds received by the subsidiaries (i) in connection with the liquidation of mortgaged properties, (ii) from repayments received from mortgagors, or (iii) from reimbursements received from the owners of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and private label securitization trusts. Accordingly, repayment of the servicing advance liabilities is dependent on the proceeds that are received on the underlying advances associated with the agreements. Two of the servicing advance facilities, with total borrowing capacity of $1.2 billion, are non-recourse to the Company.\nGeneral and administrative and allocated indirect expenses increased $14.8 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, due primarily to $24.3 million in higher legal accruals for loss contingencies and legal expenses due to legal and regulatory matters outside of normal course of business and $3.5 million of transaction costs resulting from an unsuccessful acquisition. These expenses were partially offset by a decrease of $12.8 million in the provision for our curtailment liability and our provisions for uncollectible receivables and advances and insignificant variances related to other expenses.\nContractual Obligations\nWe earn interest income on the residential loans held in the Residual Trusts and on our unencumbered mortgage loans, both of which are accounted for at amortized cost. During April 2015, we sold our residual interest in seven of the Residual Trusts, or sale of residual interests, and deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of these trusts. Interest income decreased $60.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to the aforementioned sale of our residual interests in 2015, runoff of the overall mortgage loan portfolio and a lower average yield on loans due to an increase in delinquencies that are 90 days or more past due.\nRollforwards of loan repurchase requests based on the original unpaid principal balance are included below (dollars in thousands):\nResidential loans at amortized cost decreased $773.1 million primarily as a result of the sale of our residual interests and the runoff of the overall related mortgage loan portfolio.\nInterest income decreased $60.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to the sale of our residual interests in 2015, runoff of the overall mortgage loan portfolio and a lower yield on loans due to an increase in delinquencies that are 90 days or more past due.\nFor a summary of the regulatory framework under which we operate and recent regulatory developments, refer to the Laws and Regulations section of Part I, Item 1. Business.\nAlthough we remain committed to expanding our servicing portfolio, we expect that over time we will seek to limit our investment in mortgage servicing rights. We plan to seek to sell mortgage servicing rights owned by us to WCO or to other third parties, generally on the basis that we are retained by the buyer to sub-service such rights. We may also seek to sell excess servicing spread or other similar assets. Our strategy for growing our servicing portfolio generally depends on being able to collaborate with owners of servicing rights in this manner. Our ability to effect such collaborations will depend on various factors such as the capital available to such parties, their ability to purchase servicing rights at a price attractive to them and agreement between us and them on the price and terms for our sub-servicing engagement.\n\n2014 Compared to 2013\n (1) Other additions include additions to the principal balance related to interest, servicing fees, mortgage insurance and advances.  Our repurchases of reverse loans and real estate owned have increased significantly as compared to 2014. We expect an increase to repurchase requirements due to the increased flow of defaulted HECMs and real estate owned that have moved through the buyout process.\n\n (1) Represents depreciation and amortization costs related to the increased basis in assets, including servicing and sub-servicing rights, acquired within business combination transactions. \n__________\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this report. This discussion contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and all of which could be affected by uncertainties and risks. Our actual results may differ materially from the results contemplated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors including, but not limited to, those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. Historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations, particularly in light of our recent acquisitions and regulatory developments discussed throughout this report. Refer to the Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 section located in the forepart in this report for a discussion regarding forward-looking statements.\n (6) Includes certain non-recurring costs, severance, gain on extinguishment of debt, the net impact of the Non-Residual Trusts and transaction and integration costs. \nGeneral and administrative and allocated indirect expenses decreased $27.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 resulting primarily from $40.7 million in lower legal related costs largely due to lower accruals for legal and regulatory matters outside of the ordinary course of business and $14.5 million in lower provision for uncollectible advances due to a decrease in advance balances and an improvement in collection experience, partially offset by $11.3 million in additional costs in 2015 to support efficiency and technology-related initiatives, $8.8 million in higher default and other loan servicing costs resulting from growth in the servicing portfolio, and $4.1 million in expenses relating to consolidating and re-branding our mortgage loan business as Ditech, a Walter Company.\nBorrower remittances received on the residential loans of the Residual and Non-Residual Trusts collateralizing this debt and draws under LOCs issued by a third-party and serving as credit enhancements to certain of the Non-Residual Trusts are used to make payments on the mortgage-backed debt. The maturity of the mortgage-backed debt is directly affected by the rate of principal prepayments on the collateral. As a result, the actual maturity of the mortgage-backed debt is likely to occur earlier than the stated maturity. Certain of our mortgage-backed debt issued by the Residual Trusts is also subject to voluntary redemption according to the specific terms of the respective indenture agreements, including an option by us to exercise a clean-up call. The mortgage-backed debt issued by the Non-Residual Trusts is subject to mandatory clean-up call provisions pursuant to which we are required to purchase the related mortgage loans from the trusts at the earliest of their exercisable call dates, which is the date each loan pool falls to 10% of the original principal amount. We anticipate the mandatory call obligations to settle beginning in 2017 and continuing through 2019 based upon our current cash flow projections for the Non-Residual Trusts. At December 31, 2015, the total estimated outstanding balance of the residential loans expected to be called at the respective call dates is $417.6 million. We expect to finance the capital required to exercise the mandatory clean-up call primarily through cash on hand, asset-backed financing or in partnership with a capital provider, or through any combination of the foregoing. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell the loans or obtain financing when needed. Our obligation for the mandatory clean-up call could have a significant impact on our liquidity.\n (3) Includes residential loans and real estate owned held by the Servicing segment for which it does not recognize servicing fees. \nWe endeavor to maintain our liquidity at a level sufficient to fund certain known or expected payments and to fund our working capital needs. Our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our business segments and funds available from our 2013 Revolver, master repurchase agreements, mortgage loan servicing advance facilities, issuance of HMBS and excess servicing spread financing arrangements. We may generate additional liquidity through sales of MSRs, any portion thereof, or other assets.\nInterest expense remained relatively flat in 2015 as compared to 2014. Interest expense decreased $4.2 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to lower average borrowings on master repurchase agreements resulting from a lower volume of loan fundings and lower cost of debt.\nProvided below is a summary of the average balances of our corporate debt, mortgage-backed debt of the Residual Trusts, servicing advance liabilities, and master repurchase agreements, as well as the related interest expense and average rates (dollars in thousands):\n (1) Past due status is measured based on either the MBA method or the OTS method as specified in the servicing agreement. Under the MBA method, a loan is considered past due if its monthly payment is not received by the end of the day immediately preceding the loan's next due date. Under the OTS method, a loan is considered past due if its monthly payment is not received by the loan's due date in the following month. Past due status is based on the current contractual due date of the loan, except in the case of an approved repayment plan, including a plan approved by the bankruptcy court, or a completed loan modification, in which case past due status is based on the modified due date or status of the loan. \nProvided below is a summary of results of operations, Adjusted Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA for our Reverse Mortgage segment (dollars in thousands):\nGeneral and Administrative and Allocated Indirect Expenses\nMortgage-backed debt decreased $688.1 million primarily as a result of the sale of our residual interests, which required the deconsolidation of the related mortgage-backed debt.\nInterest income decreased $10.2 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to runoff of the overall mortgage loan portfolio and a lower yield on loans due to an increase in delinquencies that are 90 days or more past due.\n (3) Included in retail originations volume for 2013 is activity related to retention initiated by the retail channel.  Net Gains on Sales of Loans\n\nNet fair value gains on reverse loans and related HMBS obligations include the contractual interest income earned on reverse loans, including those not yet securitized or no longer in securitization pools, net of interest expense on HMBS related obligations, and the change in fair value of these assets and liabilities. Included in the change in fair value are gains due to loan originations that include \"tails.\" Tails are participations in previously securitized HECMs and are created by additions to principal for borrower draws on lines-of-credit, interest, servicing fees, and mortgage insurance premiums. Economic gains and losses result from the pricing of an aggregated pool of loans exceeding the cost of the origination or acquisition of the loan as well as the change in fair value resulting from changes to market pricing on HECMs and HMBS. No gain or loss is recognized as a result of the securitization of reverse loans as these transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings. However, HECMs and HMBS related obligations are marked to fair value, which can result in a net gain or loss related to changes in market pricing.\nOverview\nIn connection with this facility, we entered into an acknowledgment with Fannie Mae, dated as of December 19, 2014, and an amended and restated consent agreement with Freddie Mac, dated as of October 21, 2015, which (i) in the case of Fannie Mae, waived or (ii) in the case of Freddie Mac, subordinated, their respective rights of set-off against rights to reimbursement for certain servicer advances and delinquency advances subject to this facility. The Fannie Mae acknowledgment agreement remains in effect unless Fannie Mae withdraws its consent (i) at each yearly anniversary of the agreement by providing thirty days' advance written notice or (ii) upon certain other specified events. The Freddie Mac consent agreement automatically renews for successive annual terms; however, Freddie Mac may terminate its consent on 30 days' written notice. If either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac were to withdraw such waiver or subordination, as applicable, of its respective rights of set-off, our ability to increase the draws on the variable funding notes or maintain the drawn balances thereunder could be materially limited or eliminated.\nIntersegment retention expense relates to fees charged by our Servicing segment to the Originations segment in relation to loan originations that resulted from access to the Servicing segment's servicing portfolio for which there was a related capitalized servicing right recorded by the Servicing segment. The decline in intersegment retention expense of $9.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 and $19.3 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due primarily to the decline in funded retention volume for which there was an existing capitalized servicing right.\n (1) Calculated on pull-through adjusted locked volume. \n__________\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our servicing rights related liabilities and corporate debt, although it does reflect interest expense associated with our servicing advance liabilities, master repurchase agreements, mortgage-backed debt, and HMBS related obligations.  Because of these limitations, Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA only as supplements. Users of our financial statements are cautioned not to place undue reliance on Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA.\nOther revenues increased $15.6 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of $19.3 million in higher fair value gains relating to charged-off loans resulting primarily from twelve months of collection activity in 2015 compared to eight months in 2014 and an increase in expected collections, and $4.3 million higher other interest income, partially offset by $7.5 million lower beneficial interest income related to a servicing asset.\nMortgage Loan Servicing Portfolio\n (1) We earn a fixed dollar amount per loan on a majority of our third-party reverse loan servicing portfolio. The weighted-average contractual servicing fee for our third-party servicing portfolio was 0.14% and 0.16% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decline in the average fee was primarily a result of lower fees per loan for certain servicing agreements, combined with the impact of a higher average loan balance.  Net Fa
