MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAll references to \"Notes\" in this Item 7 of Part II refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. Certain statements in this annual report constitute forward-looking statements. See \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Related Matters\" in Item 1 of Part I of this annual report for factors relating to these statements and \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects.\nOverview\nWe are an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing an array of services to our residential and business customers. Our communications services include local and long-distance voice, broadband, Multi-Protocol Label Switching (\"MPLS\"), private line (including special access), Ethernet, colocation, hosting (including cloud hosting and managed hosting), data integration, video, network, public access, Voice over Internet Protocol (\"VoIP\"), information technology and other ancillary services. We strive to maintain our customer relationships by, among other things, bundling our service offerings to provide our customers with a complete offering of integrated communications services.\nAt December 31, 2016, we operated approximately 11.1 million access lines in 37 states and served approximately 5.9 million broadband subscribers and 325 thousand Prism TV subscribers. We also operated 58 data centers throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Our methodology for counting access lines, broadband subscribers and data centers, which is described further in the operational metrics table below under \"Results of Operations\", and our methodology for counting Prism TV subscribers may not be comparable to those of other companies.\nPending Acquisition of Level 3\nOn October 31, 2016, we entered into a definitive merger agreement under which we propose to acquire Level 3 Communications, Inc. ( Level 3\u201d) in a cash and stock transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, Level 3 shareholders will receive $26.50 per share in cash and 1.4286 of CenturyLink shares for each share of Level 3 common stock they own at closing. CenturyLink shareholders are expected to own approximately 51% and Level 3 shareholders are expected to own approximately 49% of the combined company at closing. On December 31, 2016, Level 3 had outstanding $10.9 billion of long-term debt.\nCompletion of the transaction is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, as well as approvals from the Federal Communications Commission (the \"FCC\") and certain state regulatory authorities. The transaction is also subject to the approval of CenturyLink and Level 3 shareholders at meetings scheduled to be held on March 16, 2017, as well as other customary closing conditions. Subject to these conditions, we anticipate closing this transaction by the end of the third quarter 2017. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay Level 3 a termination fee of $472 million, or Level 3 may be obligated to pay CenturyLink a termination fee of $738 million.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had recognized $52 million of expenses associated with our activities related to the pending Level 3 acquisition. We have not recognized certain other expenses that are contingent on completion of the acquisition. These expenses include financial advisory fees and compensation expense comprised of retention bonuses, severance and stock-based compensation for stock-based awards that will vest in connection with the acquisition. Most of these contingent expenses will be recognized in our consolidated financial statements in the period in which the acquisition occurs, with the remainder recognized thereafter. The final amount of compensation expense to be recognized is partially dependent upon personnel decisions that will be made as part of integration planning. These amounts may be material.\nUpon completion of the acquisition, Level 3's assets and liabilities will be revalued and recorded at fair value. The assignment of fair value will require a significant amount of judgment. The use of fair value measures will affect the comparability of our post-acquisition financial information and may make it more difficult to predict earnings in future periods. For example, Level 3 has certain deferred costs and deferred revenues on its balance sheet associated with capacity leases. Based on the accounting guidance for business combinations, these existing deferred costs and deferred revenues are expected to be assigned little or no value in the purchase price allocation process and will thus be eliminated.\nFor unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information relating to the acquisition, see the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC by us on February 13, 2017. This pro forma financial information is based upon preliminary purchase price allocations and various assumptions and estimates, all of which we urge you to carefully consider in connection with your review of such information.\nPending Sale of Colocation Business and Data Centers\nOn November 3, 2016, we entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement to sell our data centers and colocation business to a consortium led by BC Partners, Inc. and Medina Capital (\"the Purchaser\") in exchange for cash and a minority stake in the consortium's newly-formed global secure infrastructure company. During 2016, as a result of the pending sale, the assets to be sold to the Purchaser have been reclassified as assets held for sale in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the liabilities to be assumed by the Purchaser have been reclassified and presented as current liabilities associated with assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet. As part of the transaction, the Purchaser will assume our capital lease obligations, which amounted to $305 million as of December 31, 2016, related to the properties that we will sell. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals, including a review by the Committee of Foreign Investments in the United States, as well as other customary closing conditions.\nUpon being completed, this transaction will result in the Purchaser acquiring 57 data centers. This business generated revenues of $622 million, $626 million and $643 million (excluding revenue with affiliates) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively (a small portion of which will be retained by us). Based on certain estimates and assumptions regarding the closing date and various tax matters, we currently project that the net cash proceeds from the divestiture will be approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. We plan to use a portion of these net cash proceeds to partly fund our acquisition of Level 3.\nThe following tables present additional metrics related to our data centers: Table 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hosting data center metrics:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of data centers(1)\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sellable square feet, million sq ft\n</td> <td>1.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.04)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billed square feet, million sq ft\n</td> <td>1.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utilization\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hosting data center metrics:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of data centers(1)\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sellable square feet, million sq ft\n</td> <td>1.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billed square feet, million sq ft\n</td> <td>0.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utilization\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________________________________________________\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>We define a data center as any facility where we market, sell and deliver either colocation services, multi-tenant managed services, or both.

During the second quarter of 2016, we determined that because of declines due to customer migration to other strategic products and services, certain of our business low-bandwidth data services, specifically our private line (including special access) services in our business segment, are more closely aligned with our legacy services than with our strategic services. As described in greater detail in Note 14-Segment Information in our Notes, these operating revenues are now reflected as legacy services.\nWe currently categorize our products, services and revenues among the following four categories:\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Strategic services, which include primarily broadband, MPLS, Ethernet, colocation, hosting (including cloud hosting and managed hosting), video (including our facilities-based video services, which we offer in 16 markets), VoIP, information technology and other ancillary services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Legacy services, which include primarily local and long-distance voice services, including the sale of UNEs, private line (including special access), Integrated Services Digital Network (\"ISDN\") (which use regular telephone lines to support voice, video and data applications), switched access and other ancillary services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Data integration, which includes the sale of telecommunications equipment located on customers' premises and related products and professional services, such as network management, installation and maintenance of data equipment and the building of proprietary fiber-optic broadband networks for our governmental and business customers; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Other operating revenues, which consists primarily of Connect America Fund (\"CAF\") support payments, Universal Service Fund (\"USF\") support payments and USF surcharges. We receive federal support payments from both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the CAF program, and support payments from both federal and state USF programs. These support payments are government subsidies designed to reimburse us for various costs related to certain telecommunications services, including the costs of deploying, maintaining and operating voice and broadband infrastructure in high-cost rural areas where we are not able to fully recover our costs from our customers. We also collect USF surcharges based on specific items we list on our customers' invoices to fund the FCC's universal service programs. We also generate other operating revenues from the leasing and subleasing of space in our office buildings, warehouses and other properties. Because we centrally manage the activities that generate these other operating revenues, these revenues are not included in our segment revenues.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following tables summarize our consolidated operating revenues recorded under our four revenue categories: Table 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legacy services\n</td> <td>7,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(666\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data integration\n</td> <td>533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(430\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legacy services\n</td> <td>8,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(695\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data integration\n</td> <td>577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(115\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total operating revenues decreased by $430 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased by $131 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decline in operating revenues for both periods was primarily due to lower legacy services revenues, which decreased by $666 million, or 8%, and $695 million, or 8%, for the respective periods.\nThe decline in legacy services revenues for both periods reflects the continuing loss of access lines, loss of long-distance revenues primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive products and services, including data and wireless communication services, and reductions in the volume of our private line (including special access) services. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 11.1 million access lines, or approximately 5.6% less than the number of access lines we operated at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 11.7 million access lines, or approximately 5.2% less than the number of access lines we operated at December 31, 2014. We estimate that the rate of our access lines losses will be between 4% and 6% over the full year of 2017.\nFor 2016, the growth in our strategic services revenues was primarily due to increased demand for our Ethernet, MPLS, facilities-based video and VoIP services and from rate increases on various services, which were partially offset by declines in our hosting services and losses of broadband customers. For 2015, the growth in our strategic services revenues was primarily due to increased demand for our Ethernet, MPLS, facilities-based video and IT Services and from rate increases on various services, which were partially offset by declines in our colocation and hosting services.\nData integration revenues, which are typically more volatile than our other sources of revenues, decreased by $44 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decline in data integration revenues was primarily due to declines in governmental and business sales and professional and maintenance services. Data integration revenues decreased by $115 million, or 17%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decline in data integration revenues was primarily due to declines in governmental sales and professional services, which were partially offset by an increase in maintenance services.\nOther operating revenues decreased by $17 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in other operating revenues was primarily due to lower high-cost support revenues. These declines were partially offset by higher USF surcharge revenues related to increased universal service fund contribution factors. Other operating revenues increased by $229 million, or 23%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in other operating revenues was primarily due to additional revenue recorded under the CAF Phase 2 support program. For additional information about the CAF Phase 2 support program, see the discussion below in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Connect America Fund.\"\nWe are aggressively marketing our strategic services in an effort to partially offset the continuing declines in our legacy services.\nFurther analysis of our segment operating revenues and trends impacting our performance are provided below in \"Segment Results.\"\nOperating Expenses\nOur current definitions of operating expenses are as follows:\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are expenses incurred in providing products and services to our customers.

The decrease in costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was primarily due to reductions in salaries and wages from lower headcount, professional fees, payment processing fees and customer premises equipment costs, which were substantially offset by increases in content costs for Prism TV (resulting from higher content volume and rates), network expense and USF rates. Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) decreased by $68 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding the lower customer premises equipment costs, cost of services and products increased by $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in costs of services and products was primarily due to increases in pension and postretirement costs, USF rate increases, higher network expenses and increases in content costs for Prism TV. These increases were partially offset by decreases in salaries and wages from lower headcount, professional fees and contract labor costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $121 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in severance expenses associated with our recent workforce reduction, higher payments of employee health care claims, bad debt and other expenses (including fees related to the Level 3 acquisition), which were partially offset by reductions in professional fees and property and other taxes. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $19 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower benefit expenses, insurance costs and asset impairment charges. These decreases were partially offset by increases in bad debt expense, external commissions and regulatory fines of $15 million associated with a 911 system outage.\nPension Lump Sum Offer\nOur pension plan contains provisions that allow us, from time to time, to offer lump sum payment options to certain former employees in settlement of their future retirement benefits. These lump sum payments are paid from the trust that holds the plan's assets. Under pension settlement accounting, we record an accounting settlement charge associated with these lump sum payments only if, in the aggregate, they exceed the sum of the annual service and interest costs for the plan's net periodic pension benefit cost. There were no pension lump sum offerings in 2016, other than those to eligible employees who terminated during 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we made cash settlement payments to former employees for lump sum offers of approximately $356 million, but pension settlement accounting was not triggered in 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we made cash settlement payments to former employees for lump sum offers of approximately $460 million, which triggered pension settlement accounting and resulted in us recording additional pension expense of $63 million. Pension expense is allocated to cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), selling, general and administrative and to capital projects. See Note 9-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, for additional information on the pension lump sum offers.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe following tables provide detail of our depreciation and amortization expense: Table 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(145\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization\n</td> <td>1,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(128\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(273\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(122\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization\n</td> <td>1,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(117\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(239\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnnual depreciation expense is impacted by several factors, including changes in our depreciable cost basis, changes in our estimates of the remaining economic life of certain network assets, the addition of new plant and our entry into an agreement to sell our data centers and colocation business. Depreciation expense decreased by $145 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased by $122 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The depreciation expense related to our plant was lower for both periods due to full depreciation and retirement of certain plant placed in service prior to 2016 and 2015. Additionally, we ceased depreciating property, plant and equipment assets of our colocation business when we entered into the agreement to sell that business. We estimate that we would have recorded additional depreciation expense during 2016 of $30 million if we had not agreed to sell the colocation business. The decrease in both periods was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense attributable to new plant placed in service during the respective years.\nAdditionally, in 2015, the lower depreciation expense was further offset by the impact of changes in the estimated lives of certain property, plant and equipment which resulted in additional depreciation. The changes in the estimated lives of certain property, plant and equipment resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $48 million for 2015, which was more than fully offset by the decrease in depreciation expense noted above. In addition, we developed a plan to migrate customers from one of our networks to another, which began in late 2014 and ended in late 2015. As a result, we implemented changes in estimates that reduced the remaining economic lives of certain network assets. The impact from the above-noted changes in estimates and network migration resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $90 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAmortization expense decreased by $128 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased by $117 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in amortization expense for both periods was primarily due to the use of accelerated amortization for a portion of our customer relationship assets and our entry into an agreement to sell our data centers and colocation business. The effect of using an accelerated amortization method results in an incremental decline in expense each period as the intangible assets amortize. We ceased amortizing the intangible assets of our colocation business when we entered into the agreement to sell that business. We estimate that we would have recorded additional amortization expense during 2016 of $6 million if we had not agreed to sell the colocation business. In addition, amortization of capitalized software was lower in both periods due to software becoming fully amortized faster than new software was acquired or developed.\nOther Consolidated Results\nThe following tables summarize our total other expense, net and income tax expense: Table 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,318\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,312\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expense, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,311\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,312\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,311\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expense, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,300\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $6 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest expense was substantially due to a reduction in the amount of net premium amortization recorded at acquisition due to the early retirement of several issuances of debt during the period, which has the effect of increasing interest expense and an increase in interest expense on unsecured notes related to the issuance of $1.0 billion of new debt in April, 2016 in advance of a debt maturity in June, 2016. Interest expense increased by $1 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to a reduction in the amortization of debt premiums, which was substantially offset by higher capitalized interest, lower bond coupon rates and lower interest under our Credit Facility. See Note 5-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report and Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information about our debt.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net reflects certain items not directly related to our core operations, including our share of income from partnerships we do not control, interest income, gains and losses from non-operating asset dispositions and foreign currency gains and losses. Other income, net decreased by $16 million, or 70%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in other income, net was primarily due to losses on early retirement of debt, which was partially offset by the impact of nonrecurring funding from a state economic development program. Other income, net increased by $12 million, or 109%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase in other income, net was primarily due to the impact of a 2014 impairment charge of $14 million recorded in connection with the sale of our 700 MHz A-Block Wireless Spectrum licenses, which was partially offset by a net loss on early retirement of debt in 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense decreased by $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Our income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $100 million from the amounts for the comparable prior year. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our effective income tax rate was 38.6%, 33.3% and 30.5%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflects a tax impact of $18 million from an intercompany dividend payment from one of our foreign subsidiaries to its domestic parent company that was made as part of our corporate restructuring in preparation for the sale of our colocation business. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects a tax benefit of approximately $34 million related to affiliate debt rationalization, research and development tax credits of $28 million for 2011 through 2015, and a $16 million tax decrease due to changes in state taxes caused by apportionment changes, state tax rate changes and the changes in the expected utilization of net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\"). The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects a $60 million tax benefit associated with a worthless stock deduction for the tax basis in a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary as a result of developments in bankruptcy proceedings involving its sole asset, an indirect investment in KPNQwest, N.V. The subsidiary was acquired as part of the acquisition of Qwest and we assigned it no fair value in the acquisition due to the bankruptcy proceedings, which were then ongoing. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 also reflects a $13 million tax decrease due to changes in state taxes caused by apportionment changes, state tax rate changes and the changes in the expected utilization of NOLs. The rate also reflects the absence of tax benefits from the impairment and disposition of our 700 MHz A-Block wireless spectrum licenses in 2014, because we are not likely to generate income of a character required to realize a tax benefit from the loss on disposition during the period permitted by law for utilization of that loss.

We have recast our previously reported segment results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 to conform to the current presentation. See Note 14-Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information on our changes in segment reporting.\nAllocation of Revenues and Expenses\nOur segment revenues include all revenues from our strategic services, legacy services and data integration as described in more detail above. Segment revenues are based upon each customer's classification to an individual segment. We report our segment revenues based upon all services provided to that segment's customers. For information on how we allocate expenses to our segments, as well as other additional information about our segments, see Note 14-Segment Information.\nBusiness Segment\nThe operations of our business segment have been impacted by several significant trends, including those described below:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Strategic services. Our mix of total business segment revenues continues to migrate from legacy services to strategic services as our small, medium and enterprise business, wholesale and governmental customers increasingly demand integrated data, broadband, hosting and voice services. Our Ethernet-based services in the wholesale market face competition from cable companies and competitive fiber-based telecommunications providers. We anticipate continued pricing pressure for our colocation services as vendors continue to expand their enterprise colocation operations. In recent years, our competitors, as well as several large, diversified technology companies, have made substantial investments in cloud computing. This expansion in competitive cloud computing offerings has led to increased pricing pressure, a migration towards lower-priced cloud-based services and enhanced competition for contracts, and we expect these trends to continue. Customers' demand for new technology has also increased the number of competitors offering strategic services similar to ours. Price compression from each of these above-mentioned competitive pressures has negatively impacted the operating margins of our strategic services, and we expect this trend to continue. Operating costs also impact the operating margins of our strategic services, but to a lesser extent than price compression and customer disconnects. These operating costs include employee costs, sales commissions, software costs on selected services, installation costs and third-party facility costs. We believe increases in operating costs have generally had a greater impact on the operating margins of our strategic services as compared to our legacy services, principally because our strategic services rely more heavily upon the above-listed support functions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Legacy services. We continue to experience customers migrating away from our higher margin legacy services into lower margin strategic services. Our legacy services revenues have been, and we expect they will continue to be, adversely affected by access line losses and price compression. In particular, our access, local services and long-distance revenues have been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by customer migration to more technologically advanced services, an increase in the use of non-voice communications and a related decrease in the demand for traditional voice services, industry consolidation and price compression caused by regulation and rate reductions. For example, many of our business segment customers are substituting cable, wireless and VoIP services for traditional voice telecommunications services, resulting in continued access revenue loss. Demand for our private line services (including special access) continues to decline due to our customers' optimization of their networks, industry consolidation and technological migration to higher-speed services. Although our legacy services generally face fewer direct competitors than certain of our strategic services, customer migration and, to a lesser degree, price compression from competitive pressures have negatively impacted our legacy revenues and the operating margins of our legacy services. We expect this trend to continue. Operating costs, such as installation costs and third-party facility costs, have also negatively impacted the operating margins of our legacy services, but to a lesser extent than customer loss, customer migration and price compression. Operating costs also tend to impact our legacy services to a lesser extent than our strategic services as noted above;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Data integration. We expect both data integration revenue and the related costs will fluctuate from year to year as this offering tends to be more sensitive than others to changes in the economy and in spending trends of our federal, state and local governmental customers, many of whom have experienced substantial budget cuts over the past several years, with the possibility of additional future budget cuts. Our data integration operating margins are typically smaller than most of our other offerings; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating efficiencies. We continue to evaluate our segment operating structure and focus. This involves balancing our workforce in response to our workload requirements, productivity improvements and changes in industry, competitive, technological and regulatory conditions, while achieving operational efficiencies and improving our processes through automation. However, our ongoing efforts to increase revenue will continue to require that we incur higher costs in some areas. We also expect our business segment to benefit indirectly from enhanced efficiencies in our company-wide network operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following tables summarize the results of

Revenues\nBusiness segment revenues decreased by $294 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in business segment revenues was primarily due to declines in our legacy services revenues. The decline in legacy services revenues was attributable to a reduction in local service access lines and lower volumes of long-distance and access services for the reasons noted above and to reductions in the volume of private line (including special access) services. The increase in our strategic services revenues was primarily due to increases in MPLS unit growth and higher Ethernet and VOIP volumes, which were partially offset by declines in our hosting services. The decrease in our data integration revenues was primarily due to lower sales of customer premises equipment to governmental and business customers and to declines in maintenance services. Business segment revenues decreased by $384 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in business segment revenues was primarily due to declines in legacy services revenues and data integration revenues, which were partially offset by the growth in our strategic services revenues. The decline in legacy services revenues was attributable to a reduction in local service access lines and lower volumes of long-distance, access and traditional WAN services for the reasons noted above and a reduction in private line (including special access) volumes, as well as a pricing reduction on private line services for a large wholesale customer in exchange for a longer term commitment. The growth in our strategic services revenues was primarily due to MPLS unit growth and higher Ethernet volumes, which were partially offset by a reduction in hosting services. The decrease in data integration revenues was primarily due to lower sales of customer premises equipment to governmental and business customers during the period.\nSegment Expenses\nBusiness segment expenses decreased by $37 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in our business segment expenses was primarily due to decreases in salaries and wages, professional fees and payment processing fees, which were partially offset by increases in facility costs, network expense and real estate and power costs. Business segment expenses decreased by $52 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower customer premises equipment costs resulting from the lower sales noted above in segment revenues. Excluding the lower customer premises equipment costs, business expenses increased by $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due to increases in salaries and wages, benefits expense, external commissions, network expense and facility costs, which were partially offset by decreases in professional fees, materials and supplies and fleet expenses.\nSegment Income\nBusiness segment income decreased by $257 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased by $332 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in business segment income for both periods was due predominantly to the loss of customers and lower service volumes in our legacy services.\nConsumer Segment\nThe operations of our consumer segment have been impacted by several significant trends, including those described below:\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Strategic services. In order to remain competitive and attract additional residential broadband subscribers, we believe it is important to continually increase our broadband network's scope and connection speeds. As a result, we continue to invest in our broadband network, which allows for the delivery of higher-speed broadband services to a greater number of customers. We compete in a maturing broadband market in which most consumers already have broadband services and growth rates in new subscribers have slowed. Moreover, as described further in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report, certain of our competitors continue to provide broadband services at higher average transmission speeds than ours or through advanced wireless data service offerings, both of which we believe have impacted the competitiveness of certain of our broadband offerings. The offering of our facilities-based video services in our markets requires us to incur substantial start-up expenses in advance of marketing and selling the service. Also, our associated content costs continue to increase and the video business has become more competitive as more options become available to customers to access video services through new technologies. The demand for new technology has increased the number of competitors offering strategic services similar to ours. Price compression and new technology from our competitors have negatively impacted the operating margins of our strategic services and we expect this trend to continue. Operating costs also impact the operating margins of our strategic services. These operating costs include employee costs, marketing and advertising expenses, sales commissions, Prism TV content costs and installation costs. We believe increases in operating costs have generally had a greater impact on our operating margins of our strategic services as compared to our legacy services, principally because our strategic services rely more heavily upon the above-listed costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Legacy services. Our voice revenues have been, and we expect they will continue to be, adversely affected by access line losses and lower long-distance voice service volumes. Intense competition and product substitution continue to drive our access line losses. For example, many consumers are substituting cable and wireless voice services and electronic mail, texting and social networking non-voice services for traditional voice telecommunications services. We expect that these factors will continue to negatively impact our business. As a result of the expected loss of higher margin services associated with access lines, we continue to offer our customers service bundling and other product promotions to help mitigate this trend, as described below. Customer migration and price compression from competitive pressures have not only negatively impacted our legacy revenues, but they have also negatively impacted the operating margins of our legacy services and we expect this trend to continue. Operating costs, such as installation costs and facility costs, have also negatively impacted the operating margins of our legacy services, but to a lesser extent than customer migration and price compression.

compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in our consumer segment revenues was primarily due to the declines in our legacy services revenues, which were partially offset by increases in our strategic revenues. The decline in our legacy services revenues for both periods was primarily due to lower local and long-distance voice service volumes associated with access line losses resulting from the competitive and technological factors noted above. The increase in our strategic services revenues was primarily due to 2016 rate increases resulting from various pricing initiatives on broadband, Prism TV and other strategic products and services, and increases in the number of our Prism TV customers, which were partially offset by a decline in broadband customers. Consumer segment revenues increased by $24 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in strategic services revenues was primarily due to increases in the number of Prism TV customers, as well as from 2015 price increases on various services. The decline in legacy services revenues was primarily due to declines in local and long-distance services volumes associated with access line losses resulting from the competitive and technological factors as further described above.\nSegment Expenses\nConsumer segment expenses increased by $68 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in our consumer segment expenses was primarily due to increases in costs related to Prism TV (resulting from higher content volume and rates), professional fees, sales commissions, bad debt expense and network costs, which were partially offset by reductions in salaries and wages from lower headcount and payment processing fees. Consumer segment expenses increased by $11 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily due to increases in Prism TV content costs (resulting from higher volume and rates) and bad debt expense, which were partially offset by reductions in employee-related costs, facility costs, fleet expenses and network expenses.\nSegment Income\nConsumer segment income decreased by $187 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to loss of customers from legacy services and increases in the costs related to the growth in Prism TV. Consumer segment income increased by $13 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily due to price increases on various services.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have identified certain policies and estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our past or present results of operations related to (i) goodwill, customer relationships and other intangible assets; (ii) property, plant and equipment; (iii) pension and post-retirement benefits; (iv) loss contingencies and litigation reserves; (v) Connect America Fund; and (vi) income taxes. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or they have the potential to have a material impact, on our consolidated financial statements and because they require us to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions made when accounting for the items described below were reasonable, based on information available at the time they were made. However, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.\nGoodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets\nWe amortize customer relationships primarily over an estimated life of 10 to 15 years, using either the sum-of-the-years-digits or the straight-line methods, depending on the type of customer. We amortize capitalized software using the straight-line method over estimated lives ranging up to 7 years, except for approximately $237 million of our capitalized software costs, which represents costs to develop an integrated billing and customer care system which is amortized using the straight-line method over a 20 year period. We annually review the estimated lives and methods used to amortize our other intangible assets, primarily capitalized software. The amount of future amortization expense may differ materially from current amounts, depending on the results of our annual reviews.\nOur goodwill was derived from numerous acquisitions where the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired.\nWe are required to reassign goodwill to reporting units each time we reorganize our internal reporting structure which causes a change in the composition of our reporting units. We assign goodwill to the reporting units using a relative fair value approach. We utilize the trailing twelve months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as our allocation methodology as we believe that it represents a reasonable proxy for the fair value of the operations being reorganized. The use of other fair value assignment methods could result in materially different results. For additional information on our segments, see Note 14-Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.\nWe are required to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate an impairment may have occurred. We are required to write-down the value of goodwill in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. Our reporting units are not discrete legal entities with discrete financial statements. Our assets and liabilities are employed in and relate to the operations of our reporting units. Therefore, the equity carrying value and future cash flows must be estimated each time a goodwill impairment analysis is performed on a reporting unit. As a result, our assets, liabilities and cash flows are assigned to reporting units using reasonable and consistent allocation methodologies. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions are required to perform these assignments. We believe these estimates, judgments and assumptions to be reasonable, but changes in many of these can significantly affect each reporting unit's equity carrying value and future cash flows utilized for our goodwill impairment test. Our annual assessment date for testing goodwill impairment is October 31.\nAs of October 31, 2016, we assessed goodwill for impairment for our three reporting units, which we determined to be business (excluding wholesale), consumer and wholesale and determined that the estimated fair value of our wholesale reporting unit was substantially in excess of our carrying value of equity and the estimated fair value of our business and consumer reporting units exceeded our carrying value of equity by 28% and 18%, respectively.\nFor additional information on our goodwill balances by segment, see Note 4-Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.\nWe may be required to assess our goodwill for impairment before our next required assessment date of October 31, 2017 under certain circumstances, including any failure to meet our forecasted future operating results or any significant increases in our weighted average cost of capital. In addition, we cannot assure that adverse conditions will not trigger future goodwill impairment assessments or impairment charges. A number of factors, many of which we cannot control, could affect our financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause our actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed in our goodwill impairment assessment. These factors include, but are not limited to, (i) further weakening in the overall economy; (ii) a significant decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization as a result of an adverse change to our overall business operations; (iii) changes in the discount rate we use in our testing; (iv) successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets; (v) adverse changes as a result of regulatory or legislative actions; (vi) a significant adverse change in our legal affairs or in the overall business climate; and (vii) recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of one or more of our subsidiaries that are a component of our segments. For additional information, see \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report. We will continue to monitor certain events that impact our operations to determine if an interim assessment of goodwill impairment should be performed prior to the next required assessment date of October 31, 2017.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment acquired in connection with our acquisitions was recorded based on its estimated fair value as of its acquisition date, plus the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually required asset retirement obligation. Purchased and constructed property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, plus the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually required asset retirement obligation. Renewals and betterments of plant and equipment are capitalized while repairs, as well as renewals of minor items, are charged to operating expense. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on the straight-line method using class or overall group rates. The group method provides for the recognition of the remaining net investment, less anticipated net salvage value, over the remaining useful life of the assets. This method requires the periodic revision of depreciation rates.\nNormal retirements of property, plant and equipment are charged against accumulated depreciation, with no gain or loss recognized. We depreciate such property on the straight-line method over estimated service lives ranging from 3 to 45 years.\nWe perform annual internal reviews to evaluate the reasonableness of the depreciable lives for our property, plant and equipment. Our reviews utilize models that take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history, assumptions about technology evolution and, in certain instances, actuarially determined probabilities to estimate the remaining life of our asset base.\nDue to rapid changes in technology and the competitive environment, determining the estimated economic life of telecommunications plant and equipment requires a significant amount of judgment. We regularly review data on utilization of equipment, asset retirements and salvage values to determine adjustments to our depreciation rates. The effect of a hypothetical one year increase or decrease in the estimated remaining useful lives of our property, plant and equipment would have decreased depreciation expense by approximately $390 million annually or increased depreciation expense by approximately $550 million annually, respectively.\nPension and Post-retirement Benefits\nWe sponsor a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (referred to as our qualified pension plan) for a substantial portion of our employees. In addition to this tax-qualified pension plan, we also maintain several non-qualified pension plans for certain eligible highly compensated employees. We also maintain post-retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retirees.\nIn 2016, approximately 53% of the qualified pension plan's January 1, 2016 net actuarial loss balance of $2.843 billion was subject to amortization as a component of net periodic expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits, which ranges from 9 to 10 years for the plan. The other 47% of the qualified pension plan's beginning net actuarial loss balance was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2016. The entire beginning net actuarial loss of $147 million for the post-retirement benefit plans was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2016.\nIn 2015, approximately 45% of the qualified pension plan's January 1, 2015 net actuarial loss balance of $2.740 billion was subject to amortization as a component of net periodic expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits, which ranges from 8 to 9 years for the plan. The other 55% of the qualified pension plan's beginning net actuarial loss balance was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2015. The entire beginning net actuarial loss of $277 million for the post-retirement benefit plans was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2015.\nIn 2014, approximately 16% of the qualified pension plans' January 1, 2014 net actuarial loss balance of $1.048 billion was subject to amortization as a component of net periodic expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits, which ranges from 8 to 9 years for the plans. The other 84% of the pension plans' beginning net actuarial loss balance was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2014. The entire beginning net actuarial loss of $37 million for the post-retirement benefit plans was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2014.\nIn computing our pension and post-retirement health care and life insurance benefit obligations, our most significant assumptions are the discount rate and mortality rates. In computing our periodic pension and post-retirement benefit expense, our most significant assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets.\nThe discount rate for each plan is the rate at which we believe we could effectively settle the plan's benefit obligations as of the end of the year. We selected each plan's discount rate based on a cash flow matching analysis using hypothetical yield curves from U.S. corporate bonds rated high quality and projections of the future benefit payments that constitute the projected benefit obligation for the plans. This process establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year's benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. The spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 60th to 90th percentile of U.S. high quality bonds.\nIn 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit expense for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. This change resulted in a decrease in the service and interest components in 2016. Beginning in 2016, we utilized a full yield curve approach in connection with estimating these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows, as opposed to the single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve that we have used in the past. We believe this change more precisely measures service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change did not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations but lowered our annual net periodic benefit cost by approximately $149 million in 2016. This change was treated as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, we did not adjust the amounts recorded in 2015 or 2014.\nMortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on historical demographic studies by the Society of Actuaries. In 2016, we adopted the revised mortality table and projection scale released by the Society of Actuaries (\"SOA\"), which decreased the projected benefit obligation of our benefit plans by $268 million. The 2015 revised mortality table and projection scale decreased the 2015 projected benefit obligation of our benefit plans by $379 million. In 2014, the SOA published new mortality rate tables reflecting increases in the projected life expectancies of North Americans since its publications of earlier tables. We adopted the new tables immediately. This resulted in an increase to the projected benefit obligation of approximately $1.3 billion for our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. The change in the projected benefit obligation of our benefit plans was recognized as part of the net actuarial loss and is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a portion of which is subject to amortization over the remaining estimated life of plan participants, which was approximately 9 to 10 years as of December 31, 2016.\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets is the long-term rate of return we expect to earn on the plans' assets in the future, net of administrative expenses paid from plan assets. The rate of return is determined by the strategic allocation of plan assets and the long-term risk and return forecast for each asset class. The forecasts for each asset class are generated primarily from an analysis of the long-term expectations of various third party investment management organizations to which we then add a factor of 50 basis points to reflect the benefit we expect to result from our active management of the assets. The expected rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually and revised, as necessary, to reflect changes in the financial markets and our investment strategy.\nTo compute the expected return on pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets, we apply an expected rate of return to the fair value of the pension plan assets and to the fair value of the post-retirement benefit plan assets adjusted for contribution timing and for projected benefit payments to be made from the plan assets. Annual market volatility for these assets (higher or lower than expected return) is reflected in the net actuarial losses.\nChanges in any of the above factors could significantly impact operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive (loss) income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as well as the value of the liability and accumulated other comprehensive loss of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheets. The expected return on plan assets is reflected as a reduction to our pension and post-retirement benefit expense. If our assumed expected rates of return for 2016 were 100 basis points lower, our qualified pension and post-retirement benefit expenses for 2016 would have increased by $92 million. If our assumed discount rates for 2016 were 100 basis points lower, our qualified pension and post-retirement benefit expenses for 2016 would have increased by $46 million and our projected benefit obligation for 2016 would have increased by approximately $1.753 billion.\nLoss Contingencies and Litigation Reserves\nWe are involved in several material legal proceedings, as described in more detail in Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. We assess potential losses in relation to these and other pending or threatened tax and legal matters. For matters not related to income taxes, if a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we recognize an expense for the estimated loss. To the extent these estimates are more or less than the actual liability resulting from the resolution of these matters, our earnings will be increased or decreased accordingly. If the differences are material, our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted.\nFor matters related to income taxes, if we determine in our judgment that the impact of an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority, then we recognize in our financial statements a benefit for the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if we determine in our judgment that the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Though the validity of any tax position is a matter of tax law, the body of statutory, regulatory and interpretive guidance on the application of the law is complex and often ambiguous. Because of this, whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain.\nConnect America Fund\nIn 2015, we accepted CAF funding from the FCC of approximately $500 million per year for six years to fund the deployment of voice and broadband capable infrastructure for approximately 1.2 million rural households and businesses (living units) in 33 states under the CAF Phase 2 high-cost support program. This program provides a monthly high-cost subsidy similar to the support provided by the FCC's previous cost reimbursement programs. Although we believe that there is no specific authoritative U.S. GAAP guidance for the treatment of government assistance, we identified three acceptable methods to account for these funds: (1) recognize revenue when entitled to receive cash, (2) defer cash received until the living units are enabled to receive the service at the FCC specified level, or (3) record the cash received as contra capital. After assessing these alternatives, we have determined that we will recognize CAF Phase 2 funds each month as revenue when we are entitled to receive the cash less a deferred amount. The amount of revenue deferred in 2016 was approximately $12 million. We believe our recognition methodology is consistent with other companies in our industry in the United States, but may not necessarily be consistent with companies outside the United States that receive similar government funding, and we cannot provide assurances to this effect.\nIn computing the amount of revenue to recognize, we assume that we will not be able to economically enable 100% of the required living units in every state with voice and broadband capabilities under the CAF Phase 2 program. We defer recognition of the funds related to potential living units that we estimate we will not enable until we can with reasonable assurance determine that we can fully meet the enablement targets. As disclosed elsewhere herein, in some limited instances, a portion of the funds must be returned if enablement targets are not attained. Based on estimated enablement, the effect of a hypothetical 1% decrease in our estimate of living units we will not enable with voice and broadband capabilities under the CAF Phase 2 program would have increased our revenue by $3 million in 2016 and a 1% increase would have decreased our revenue by $9 million in 2016.\nFor additional information about the CAF Phase 2 support program, see the discussion below in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Connect America Fund.\"\nIncome Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes includes amounts for tax consequences deferred to future periods. We record deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflecting future tax consequences attributable to tax credit carryforwards, differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and the tax bases of those assets and liabilities and tax net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs. Deferred taxes are computed using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe measurement of deferred taxes often involves the exercise of considerable judgment related to the realization of tax basis. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment that tax positions taken in filed tax returns and the resulting tax basis are more likely than not to be sustained if they are audited by taxing authorities. Assessing tax rates that we expect to apply and determining the years when the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income requires judgment about the future apportionment of our income among the states in which we operate. Any changes in our practices or judgments involved in the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn connection with recording deferred income tax assets and liabilities, we establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be realized. We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine whether adjustments to our valuation allowance are appropriate in light of changes in facts or circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. In making this evaluation, we rely on our recent history of pre-tax earnings. We also rely on our forecasts of future earnings and the nature and timing of future deductions and benefits represented by the deferred tax assets, all which involve the exercise of significant judgment. At December 31, 2016, we established a valuation allowance of $375 million primarily related to state NOLs, as it is more likely than not that these NOLs will expire unused. If forecasts of future earnings and the nature and estimated timing of future deductions and benefits change in the future, we may determine that a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets is appropriate, which could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. See Note 13-Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAt December 31, 2016, we held cash and cash equivalents of $222 million and we had $1.630 billion of borrowing capacity available under our $2 billion amended and restated revolving credit facility (referred to as our \"Credit Facility\", which is described further below). At December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents of $44 million were held in foreign bank accounts for the purpose of funding our foreign operations. Due to various factors, our access to foreign cash is generally much more restricted than our access to domestic cash.\nOur executive officers and our Board of Directors periodically review our sources and potential uses of cash in connection with our annual budgeting process. Generally speaking, our principal funding source is cash from operating activities, and our principal cash requirements include operating expenses, capital expenditures, income taxes, debt repayments, dividends, periodic stock repurchases, periodic pension contributions and other benefits payments. As discussed below, the amount we pay for income taxes is expected to increase for most of 2017, and the amount we pay for retiree healthcare benefits is expected to increase substantially in 2017. The potential impact of the pending sale of our colocation business and data centers and the potential impact of the pending acquisition of Level 3 are further described below.\nBased on our current capital allocation objectives, during 2017 we anticipate expending approximately $2.6 billion of cash for capital investment in property, plant and equipment and up to $1.176 billion for dividends on our common stock, based on the current annual common stock dividend rate of $2.16 and the current number of outstanding common shares, assuming solely for these purposes no impact from the Level 3 acquisition. During 2017, we have debt maturities of $1.421 billion, scheduled debt principal payments of $22 million and capital lease and other fixed payments of approximately $100 million (including $41 million of capital lease obligations related to the colocation operations), excluding liabilities that we expect to assume later in 2017 in connection with consummating the Level 3 acquisition. Each of the expenditures are described further below.\nWe will continue to monitor our future sources and uses of cash, and anticipate that we will make adjustments to our capital allocation strategies when, as and if determined by our Board of Directors. We typically use our revolving credit facility as a source of liquidity for operating activities and our other cash requirements.\nPotential Impact of the Sale of Our Colocation Business and Data Centers\nIf, as anticipated, we sell our colocation business and data centers in the manner discussed in Note 3-Pending Sale of Colocation Business and Data Centers to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, we expect to receive net cash proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion from the sale, which is net of tax payments relating to the sale of approximately $100 million to $200 million, which we anticipate will be triggered by certain corporate restructuring actions we are taking in the first quarter of 2017 regarding certain subsidiaries involved in the colocation business. We also expect ongoing cash flows from operating activities will be negatively impacted by approximately $30 million to $45 million per quarter.\nPotential Impact of the Pending Acquisition of Level 3\nIf, as anticipated, we complete the acquisition of Level 3 by the end of third quarter of 2017 in the manner discussed in Note 2-Pending Acquisition of Level 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, we expect our operations, financial position and cash flows to be significantly impacted following the closing of the transaction. We expect to issue a significant amount of new debt to finance the Level 3 acquisition, and we would assume approximately $10.9 billion of Level 3's outstanding debt upon consummating the acquisition. With this additional debt, we would expect our cash paid for interest payments to be significantly higher following the closing of the transaction. We project that our capital expenditures would increase significantly; we anticipate, based on information included in Level 3's annual guidance regarding its estimated 2017 capital expenditures, that Level 3 will spend approximately $100 million to $125 million per month on average, in the period prior to closing, but that amount could be significantly different than amounts that we expect to spend in the months following the closing of the transaction. In connection with consummating the acquisition, we would expect to issue approximately 538 million shares of our common stock to Level 3 stockholders (including shares of CenturyLink common stock expected to be issued in exchange for outstanding Level 3 equity awards), based on the number of Level 3 shares held of record on January 27, 2017. Based on our current quarterly common stock dividend rate of $0.54 per share, this issuance of additional shares would result in an additional incremental dividend payment of approximately $290 million per quarter. Also, we expect our upcoming cash payments for transaction costs, integration costs and debt financing costs to be material primarily following the closing of the transaction. These above factors are expected to result in a net cash outflow for the period of 2017 following the closing. However, we expect we will have sufficient liquidity to more than offset the impact of the net cash outflows.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis in order to enhance and modernize our networks, compete effectively in our markets and expand our service offerings. We evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted impact on revenue growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention) and our expected return on investment. The amount of capital investment is influenced by, among other things, demand for our services and products, cash flow generated by operating activities, cash required for other purposes and regulatory considerations (such as our CAF Phase 2 infrastructure buildout requirements). Based on current circumstances, we estimate that our total capital expenditures for 2017 will be approximately $2.6 billion, inclusive of CAF Phase 2 related capital expenditures, but exclusive of additional capital expenditures with respect to the Level 3 operations that we expect to acquire later this year.\nOur capital expenditures continue to be focused on our strategic services. For more information on our capital spending, see \"Business\" and \"Risk Factors\" in Items 1 and 1A, respectively, of Part I of this annual report.\nDebt and Other Financing Arrangements\nSubject to market conditions, we expect to continue to issue debt securities from time to time in the future to refinance a substantial portion of our maturing debt, including issuing Qwest Corporation debt securities to refinance its maturing debt to the extent feasible. The availability, interest rate and other terms of any new borrowings will depend on the ratings assigned to us and Qwest Corporation by credit rating agencies, among other factors. For further information on our debt maturities, see \"Future Contractual Obligations\" below.\nAs of the date of this annual report, the credit ratings for the senior unsecured debt of CenturyLink, Inc. and Qwest Corporation were as follows: Table 227: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CenturyLink, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Qwest Corporation\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standard & Poor's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's Investors Service, Inc.(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ba3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ba1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch Ratings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BB+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________________________________________________________\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>On March 15, 2016, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. downgraded CenturyLink, Inc.'s rating from Ba2 to Ba3 and downgraded Qwest Corporation's rating from Baa3 to Ba1.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our credit ratings are reviewed and adjusted from time to time by the rating agencies, and downgrades of CenturyLink, Inc.'s senior unsecured debt ratings could, under certain circumstances, incrementally increase the cost of our borrowing under the Credit Facility. Moreover, any additional downgrades of CenturyLink, Inc.'s or Qwest Corporation's senior unsecured debt ratings could impact our access to debt capital or further raise our borrowing costs. See \"Risk Factors-Risks Affecting our Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report.\nFollowing the announcement of our pending acquisition of Level 3, Standard & Poor's indicated that CenturyLink, Inc.'s current unsecured senior debt rating of BB has been placed on watch with negative implications, Moody's Investor Service, Inc. indicated that CenturyLink, Inc.'s current senior unsecured debt rating of Ba3 has been placed on review for downgrade and Fitch Ratings indicated that CenturyLink, Inc.'s current unsecured senior debt rating of BB+ has been placed on negative watch. Additionally, Qwest Corporation's current unsecured senior debt rating of Ba1 has been placed on review for downgrade by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and its current unsecured senior debt rating of BBB- has been placed on negative watch by Fitch Ratings. It is expected that any downgrades would be made only following the completion of the Level 3 acquisition.\nNet Operating Loss Carryforwards\nIn recent years, we have been using Net Operating Loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards to offset a large portion of our federal taxable income. As of December 31, 2016, we have substantially utilized our federal NOL carryforwards. A portion of these remaining NOL carryforwards are subject to the limitations imposed by section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\"Code\"). As a result of the substantial utilization of the NOL carryforwards in prior years and the limitations imposed on portions of the remaining NOL carryforward balance, the amounts of our cash flows dedicated to or required for the payment of federal taxes has increased and is expected to continue to increase substantially during 2017 prior to our anticipated acquisition of additional NOLs later this year, as described further below. The amounts of our near-term tax payments will depend upon many factors, including our future earnings and tax circumstances. Based on current laws (including the extension of bonus depreciation) and our current estimates of 2017 earnings, we estimate our cash income tax liability related to 2017 will be between $500 million to $600 million, exclusive of (i) tax payments relating to the sale of our data centers and colocation business of approximately $100 million to $200 million, which we anticipate will be triggered by certain corporate restructuring actions we are taking in the first quarter of 2017 regarding certain subsidiaries involved in the colocation business and (ii) the impact of acquiring Level 3.\nBased on information provided to us by Level 3, as of December 31, 2016, Level 3 had approximately $9.0 billion of NOL carryforwards that we expect to acquire in connection with the Level 3 transaction. We cannot assure you that we will be able to use these NOL carryforwards fully, or at all. See \"Risk Factors-Risk Relating to Our Pending Acquisition of Level 3-We cannot assure you, whether, when or in what amounts we will be able to use Level 3's net operating loss carryforwards following the Level 3 acquisition\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report.\nDividends\nWe currently expect to continue our current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends in respect of our common stock subject to our Board of Directors' discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Our current quarterly common stock dividend rate is $0.54 per share, as approved by our Board of Directors, which we believe is a dividend rate per share that gives us the flexibility to balance our multiple objectives of managing our business, paying our fixed commitments and returning cash to our shareholders. Assuming continued payment during 2017 at this rate of $0.54 per share, our average total dividends paid each quarter prior to the Level 3 acquisition would be approximately $294 million based on our current number of outstanding shares (which does not reflect shares that we expect to issue in connection with the Level 3 acquisition or any other shares that we might issue or repurchase in future periods). See \"Risk Factors-Risks Affecting Our Business\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report.\nCredit Facility\nOur $2 billion Credit Facility matures on December 3, 2019 and has 16 lenders, each with commitments ranging from $3.5 million to $198.5 million. The Credit Facility allows us to obtain revolving loans and to issue up to $400 million of letters of credit, which upon issuance reduces the amount available for other extensions of credit. Interest is assessed on borrowings using either the LIBOR or the base rate (each as defined in the Credit Facility) plus an applicable margin between 1.00% and 2.25% per annum for LIBOR loans and 0.00% and 1.25% per annum for base rate loans depending on our then current senior unsecured long-term debt rating. Our obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by nine of our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2016, we had $370 million in borrowings and no amounts of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility.\nUnder the Credit Facility, we, and our indirect subsidiary, Qwest Corporation, must maintain a debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined in our Credit Facility) ratio of not more than 4.0:1.0 and 2.85:1.0, respectively, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter for the four quarters then ended. The Credit Facility also contains a negative pledge covenant, which generally requires us to secure equally and ratably any advances under the Credit Facility if we pledge assets or permit liens on our property for the benefit of other debtholders. The Credit Facility also has a cross payment default provision, and the Credit Facility and certain of our debt securities also have cross acceleration provisions. When present, these provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. Our debt to EBITDA ratios could be adversely affected by a wide variety of events, including unforeseen expenses or contingencies. This could reduce our financing flexibility due to potential restrictions on incurring additional debt under certain provisions of our debt agreements or, in certain circumstances, could result in a default under certain provisions of such agreements.\nTerm Loans and Revolving Letter of Credit\nAt December 31, 2016, CenturyLink, Inc. owed $336 million under a term loan maturing in 2019 and Qwest Corporation owed $100 million under a term loan maturing in 2025. Both of these term loans include covenants substantially similar to those set forth in the Credit Facility.\nWe have a $160 million uncommitted revolving letter of credit facility which enables us to provide letters of credit under terms that may be more favorable than those under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2016, our outstanding letters of credit totaled $105 million under this facility.\nFor information on our outstanding debt securities, see immediately below \"Future Contractual Obligations\" and Note 5-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.\nLevel 3 Financing Commitment Letter\nIn connection with entering into our merger agreement with Level 3, we obtained a debt commitment letter from a group of lenders. See Note 5-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, for additional information on the financing commitment letter.\nFuture Contractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our estimated future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016: Table 229: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(1)(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt and\ncapital leases(2)\n</td> <td>1,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(3)\n</td> <td>295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments(4)\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Post-retirement benefit obligation(5)\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-qualified pension obligations(5)\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized tax benefits(6)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total future contractual obligations (7)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes current maturities and capital lease obligations, but excludes unamortized discounts, net and unamortized debt issuance costs.

At December 31, 2016, the accounting unfunded status of our qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans and qualified post-retirement benefit plans was $2.409 billion and $3.360 billion, respectively. See Note 9-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information about our pension and post-retirement benefit arrangements.\nBenefits paid by our qualified pension plan are paid through a trust that holds all of the plan's assets. Based on current laws and circumstances, we do not expect any contributions to be required for our qualified pension plan during 2017. The amount of required contributions to our qualified pension plan in 2018 and beyond will depend on a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control, including earnings on plan investments, prevailing interest rates, demographic experience, changes in plan benefits and changes in funding laws and regulations. We occasionally make voluntary contributions to the trust in addition to required contributions, including voluntary contributions in the amount of $100 million made in the third quarter of both 2016 and 2015. We currently expect to make a voluntary contribution of $100 million to the trust in 2017.\nSubstantially all of our post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits plans are unfunded. Several trusts hold assets that have been used to help cover the health care costs of certain retirees. Assets in the post-retirement trusts have been substantially depleted as of December 31, 2016; however, we will continue to pay certain benefits through the trusts. The fair value of these trust assets was approximately $53 million at December 31, 2016, with a portion comprised of investments with restricted liquidity. Benefits not paid through the trusts will be paid directly by us. As described further in Note 9-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, aggregate benefits paid by us under these plans (net of participant contributions and direct subsidy receipts) were $129 million, $116 million and $88 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, while the amounts paid from the trust were $145 million, $163 million and $219 million, respectively. For additional information on our expected future benefits payments for our post-retirement benefit plans, please see Note 9-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II in this annual report.\nFor 2017, our estimated annual long-term rates of return are 6.5% and 5.0% for the pension plan trust assets and post-retirement plans' trust assets, respectively, based on the assets currently held. However, actual returns could be substantially different.\nWorkforce Reductions\nIn response to the continued decline of our legacy services revenues and to better align our workforce with our workload requirements, we periodically implement workforce reduction programs. In the third quarter of 2016, we announced plans to reduce our workforce, initially through voluntary severance packages and the balance through involuntary reductions. We recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016 a charge for severance expenses and other one-time termination benefits of $164 million, $98 million of which remained to be paid as of December 31, 2016.\nConnect America Fund\nIn 2015, we accepted CAF funding from the FCC of approximately $500 million per year for six years to fund the deployment of voice and broadband capable infrastructure for approximately 1.2 million rural households and businesses in 33 states under the CAF Phase 2 high-cost support program. The funding from the CAF Phase 2 support program has substantially replaced the funding from the interstate USF program that we previously utilized to support voice services in high-cost rural markets in these 33 states. In late 2015, we began receiving these monthly support payments from the FCC under the new CAF Phase 2 support program, which included (i) monthly support payments at a higher rate than under the interstate USF support program and (ii) a substantial one-time transitional payment, designed to align the prior USF payments with the new CAF Phase 2 payments for the full year 2015. For 2016, we continued to receive monthly support payments at the higher rate than under the interstate USF support program. We received $214 million and $209 million more cash from the CAF Phase 2 program for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, than the projected amounts we would have otherwise received during the same periods under the interstate USF support program.\nAs a result of accepting CAF Phase 2 support payments for 33 states, we will be obligated to make substantial capital expenditures to build broadband infrastructure over the next several years. See \"Capital Expenditures\" above.\nFor additional information on the FCC's CAF order and the USF program, see \"Business-Regulation\" in Item 1 of Part I of this annual report and see \"Risk Factors-Risks Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report.\nIn 2013, under the CAF Phase 1 Round 2 program, we received $40 million in funding for deployment of broadband services in rural areas. In compliance with program terms, during the second half of 2016 we returned $23 million for failing to meet interim buildout milestones within the FCC specified time frames. As of December 31, 2016, we have included the remaining $17 million of funding in deferred credits and other liabilities - other on our consolidated balance sheet. At the conclusion of the CAF 1 Round 2 program in the first quarter 2017, we will have an opportunity to reclaim a majority of the interim refund if we ultimately meet the CAF 1 Round 2 buildout targets.\nHistorical Information\nThe following tables summarize our consolidated cash flow activities: Table 245: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase /\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(544\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(2,994\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,853\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(1,518\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,301\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(783\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase /\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(2,853\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,077\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(224\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(2,301\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,151\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $544 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a significant negative variance in net income adjusted for non-cash items (attributable to higher cash taxes paid and lower profitability), which was partially offset by a positive variance in the change in accounts payable. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a slight negative variance in net income adjusted for non-cash items along with negative variances in accounts payable and other noncurrent assets and liabilities, net. The decreases were substantially offset with positive variances in accrued income and other taxes and other current assets and liabilities, net, which was primarily due to a payment of approximately $235 million in 2014 to settle certain litigation. Our net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 and 2015 were positively impacted by the cash received from the CAF Phase 2 support program, which was $214 million and $209 million greater in 2016 and 2015, respectively, than the projected amounts of cash we would have otherwise received during the same periods under the interstate USF support program. For additional information about our operating results, see \"Results of Operations\" above.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $141 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 substantially due to an increase in payments for property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $224 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a decrease in payments of property, plant and equipment and amounts paid for acquisitions in 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased by $783 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a reduction of common stock repurchases. Net cash used in financing activities increased by $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to additional common stock repurchases. Net debt repayments have been about the same for all three years.\nOn December 23, 2016, a subsidiary of Embarq Corporation redeemed $5 million of its 8.375% Notes due 2025, which resulted in an immaterial loss.\nOn September 19, 2016, a subsidiary of Embarq Corporation redeemed all of its 8.77% Notes due 2017, which was less than $4 million and resulted in an immaterial loss.\nOn September 15, 2016, Qwest Corporation redeemed $287 million of its 7.5% Notes due 2051, which resulted in a loss of $9 million.\nOn August 29, 2016, Qwest Corporation redeemed all $661 million of its 7.375% Notes due 2051, which resulted in a loss of $18 million.\nOn August 22, 2016, Qwest Corporation issued $978 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% Notes due 2056, including $128 million principal amount that was sold pursuant to an over-allotment option, in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and other expenses, of $946 million.\nOn June 1, 2016, Embarq Corporation paid at maturity the $1.184 billion principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest due under its 7.082% Notes.\nOn May 2, 2016, Qwest Corporation paid at maturity the $235 million principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest due under its 8.375% Notes.\nOn April 6, 2016, CenturyLink, Inc. issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 7.5% Notes due 2024, in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and other expenses, of $988 million.\nOn January 29, 2016, Qwest Corporation issued $235 million aggregate principal amount of 7% Notes due 2056, in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and other expenses, of $227 million.\nSee Note 5-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, for additional information on our outstanding debt securities.\nOther Matters\nIn February 2015, the FCC adopted new regulations that regulate broadband services as a public utility service under Title II of the Communications Act. In light of pending litigation and changes in the composition of the FCC, we believe it is premature for us to determine the ultimate impact of the new regulations on our operations. For additional information, see Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters\u201d in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report.\nWe have cash management arrangements with certain of our principal subsidiaries, in which substantial portions of the subsidiaries' cash is regularly advanced to us. Although we periodically repay these advances to fund the subsidiaries' cash requirements throughout the year, at any given point in time we may owe a substantial sum to our subsidiaries under these advances, which, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, are eliminated in consolidation and therefore not recognized on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe also are involved in various legal proceedings that could substantially impact our financial position. See Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for the current status of such legal proceedings.\nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate long-term debt obligations and fluctuations in certain foreign currencies. We seek to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates.\nManagement periodically reviews our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and periodically implements strategies to manage the exposure. From time to time, we have used derivative instruments to (i) lock-in or swap our exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2016, we had no such instruments outstanding. We have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately $19.6 billion (excluding capital lease and other obligations with a carrying amount of $440 million) of long-term debt outstanding, approximately 96% of which bears interest at fixed rates and is therefore not exposed to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2016, we had $806 million floating rate debt exposed to changes in either the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the Prime Rate. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in LIBOR relative to this debt would decrease our annual pre-tax earnings by $8 million.\nBy operating internationally, we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the foreign currencies used by our international subsidiaries, primarily the British Pound, and secondarily the Canadian Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Hong Kong Dollar and the Singapore Dollar. Although the percentages of our consolidated revenues and costs that are denominated in these currencies are immaterial, future volatility in exchange rates and an increase in the number of transactions could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations. We use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to this foreign currency risk, measuring the change in financial position arising from a hypothetical 10% change in the exchange rates of these currencies, relative to the U.S. Dollar, with all other variables held constant. The aggregate potential change in the fair value of financial assets resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in these exchange rates was $18 million at December 31, 2016.\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of exposures to market risks. Actual values may differ materially from those disclosed by us from time to time if market conditions vary from the assumptions used in the analyses performed. These analyses only incorporate the risk exposures that existed at December 31, 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support and we do not engage in leasing, hedging or other similar activities that expose us to any significant liabilities that are not (i) reflected on the face of the consolidated financial statements, (ii) disclosed in Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, or in the Future Contractual Obligations table included in this Item 7 of Part II above, or (iii) discussed under the heading \"Market Risk\" above.", "item_7_truncated": "The results for our business and consumer segments are summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: \nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hosting data center metrics:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of data centers(1)\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sellable square feet, million sq ft\n</td> <td>1.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Billed square feet, million sq ft\n</td> <td>0.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utilization\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 other long-term liabilities, such as accruals for legal matters and other taxes that are not contractual obligations by nature.

In 2016, we adopted the revised mortality table and projection scale released by the Society of Actuaries (\"SOA\"), which decreased the projected benefit obligation of our benefit plans by $268 million. The 2015 revised mortality table and projection scale decreased the 2015 projected benefit obligation of our benefit plans by $379 million. In 2014, the SOA published new mortality rate tables reflecting increases in the projected life expectancies of North Americans since its publications of earlier tables. We adopted the new tables immediately. This resulted in an increase to the projected benefit obligation of approximately $1.3 billion for our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. The change in the projected benefit obligation of our benefit plans was recognized as part of the net actuarial loss and is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a portion of which is subject to amortization over the remaining estimated life of plan participants, which was approximately 9 to 10 years as of December 31, 2016.\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase /\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(544\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(2,994\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,853\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(1,518\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,301\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(783\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization expense decreased by $128 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased by $117 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in amortization expense for both periods was primarily due to the use of accelerated amortization for a portion of our customer relationship assets and our entry into an agreement to sell our data centers and colocation business. The effect of using an accelerated amortization method results in an incremental decline in expense each period as the intangible assets amortize. We ceased amortizing the intangible assets of our colocation business when we entered into the agreement to sell that business. We estimate that we would have recorded additional amortization expense during 2016 of $6 million if we had not agreed to sell the colocation business. In addition, amortization of capitalized software was lower in both periods due to software becoming fully amortized faster than new software was acquired or developed.\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Consumer Segment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Broadband services (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other strategic services (2)\n</td> <td>458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total strategic services revenues\n</td> <td>3,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legacy services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Voice services (3)\n</td> <td>2,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(234\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other legacy services (4)\n</td> <td>312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total legacy services revenues\n</td> <td>2,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(234\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data integration\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>5,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(119\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>2,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(187\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment income margin percentage\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with recording deferred income tax assets and liabilities, we establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be realized. We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine whether adjustments to our valuation allowance are appropriate in light of changes in facts or circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. In making this evaluation, we rely on our recent history of pre-tax earnings. We also rely on our forecasts of future earnings and the nature and timing of future deductions and benefits represented by the deferred tax assets, all which involve the exercise of significant judgment. At December 31, 2016, we established a valuation allowance of $375 million primarily related to state NOLs, as it is more likely than not that these NOLs will expire unused. If forecasts of future earnings and the nature and estimated timing of future deductions and benefits change in the future, we may determine that a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets is appropriate, which could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. See Note 13-Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information.\nIn 2015, we accepted CAF funding from the FCC of approximately $500 million per year for six years to fund the deployment of voice and broadband capable infrastructure for approximately 1.2 million rural households and businesses in 33 states under the CAF Phase 2 high-cost support program. The funding from the CAF Phase 2 support program has substantially replaced the funding from the interstate USF program that we previously utilized to support voice services in high-cost rural markets in these 33 states. In late 2015, we began receiving these monthly support payments from the FCC under the new CAF Phase 2 support program, which included (i) monthly support payments at a higher rate than under the interstate USF support program and (ii) a substantial one-time transitional payment, designed to align the prior USF payments with the new CAF Phase 2 payments for the full year 2015. For 2016, we continued to receive monthly support payments at the higher rate than under the interstate USF support program. We received $214 million and $209 million more cash from the CAF Phase 2 program for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, than the projected amounts we would have otherwise received during the same periods under the interstate USF support program.\nPension Lump Sum Offer\nCapital Expenditures\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(68\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>3,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>4,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(239\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(326\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following tables summarize our total other expense, net and income tax expense: \nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016(1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions except\nper share amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>15,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>2,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>1,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>338\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>772\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic earnings per common share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decline in legacy services revenues for both periods reflects the continuing loss of access lines, loss of long-distance revenues primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive products and services, including data and wireless communication services, and reductions in the volume of our private line (including special access) services. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 11.1 million access lines, or approximately 5.6% less than the number of access lines we operated at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 11.7 million access lines, or approximately 5.2% less than the number of access lines we operated at December 31, 2014. We estimate that the rate of our access lines losses will be between 4% and 6% over the full year of 2017.\nOther operating revenues decreased by $17 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in other operating revenues was primarily due to lower high-cost support revenues. These declines were partially offset by higher USF surcharge revenues related to increased universal service fund contribution factors. Other operating revenues increased by $229 million, or 23%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in other operating revenues was primarily due to additional revenue recorded under the CAF Phase 2 support program.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a slight negative variance in net income adjusted for non-cash items along with negative variances in accounts payable and other noncurrent assets and liabilities, net. The decreases were substantially offset with positive variances in accrued income and other taxes and other current assets and liabilities, net, which was primarily due to a payment of approximately $235 million in 2014 to settle certain litigation. Our net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 and 2015 were positively impacted by the cash received from the CAF Phase 2 support program, which was $214 million and $209 million greater in 2016 and 2015, respectively, than the projected amounts of cash we would have otherwise received during the same periods under the interstate USF support program.

The nature and terms of these arrangements vary.  For information on debt that we expect to assume or incur in connection with consummating the Level 3 acquisition, see \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report and Note 5-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.\nProperty, plant and equipment acquired in connection with our acquisitions was recorded based on its estimated fair value as of its acquisition date, plus the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually required asset retirement obligation. Purchased and constructed property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, plus the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually required asset retirement obligation. Renewals and betterments of plant and equipment are capitalized while repairs, as well as renewals of minor items, are charged to operating expense. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on the straight-line method using class or overall group rates. The group method provides for the recognition of the remaining net investment, less anticipated net salvage value, over the remaining useful life of the assets. This method requires the periodic revision of depreciation rates.\nBusiness segment income decreased by $257 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased by $332 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in business segment income for both periods was due predominantly to the loss of customers and lower service volumes in our legacy services.\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legacy services\n</td> <td>8,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(695\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data integration\n</td> <td>577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(115\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (6) Represents the amount of tax and interest we would pay for our unrecognized tax benefits.

The decline in data integration revenues was primarily due to declines in governmental sales and professional services, which were partially offset by an increase in maintenance services.\nGoodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Business Segment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>High-bandwidth data services (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hosting services (2)\n</td> <td>1,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other strategic services (3)\n</td> <td>624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total strategic services revenues\n</td> <td>4,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legacy services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Voice services (4)\n</td> <td>2,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(189\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Low-bandwidth data services (5)\n</td> <td>1,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(299\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other legacy services (6)\n</td> <td>1,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total legacy services revenues\n</td> <td>5,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(539\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data integration\n</td> <td>575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(113\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>10,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(384\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses\n</td> <td>5,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(332\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment margin percentage\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (2) We define a data center as any facility where we market, sell and deliver either colocation services, multi-tenant managed services, or both.

This decrease was primarily due to loss of customers from legacy services and increases in the costs related to the growth in Prism TV. Consumer segment income increased by $13 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily due to price increases on various services.\n \u2022 our open purchase orders as of December 31, 2016. These purchase orders are generally issued at fair value, and are generally cancelable without penalty; \n \u2022 cash funding requirements for qualified pension benefits payable to certain eligible current and future retirees. Benefits paid by our qualified pension plan are paid through a trust. Cash funding requirements for this trust are not included in this table as we are not able to reliably estimate required contributions to this trust. Our funding projections are discussed further below; \nOur total operating revenues decreased by $430 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased by $131 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decline in operating revenues for both periods was primarily due to lower legacy services revenues, which decreased by $666 million, or 8%, and $695 million, or 8%, for the respective periods.\n (3) Includes $750 million of operating lease future rental commitments related to our colocation operations. See Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information regarding the future commitments for operating leases related to our colocation operations. \nWe are involved in several material legal proceedings, as described in more detail in Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. We assess potential losses in relation to these and other pending or threatened tax and legal matters. For matters not related to income taxes, if a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we recognize an expense for the estimated loss. To the extent these estimates are more or less than the actual liability resulting from the resolution of these matters, our earnings will be increased or decreased accordingly. If the differences are material, our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted.\nIn 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit expense for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. This change resulted in a decrease in the service and interest components in 2016. Beginning in 2016, we utilized a full yield curve approach in connection with estimating these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows, as opposed to the single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve that we have used in the past. We believe this change more precisely measures service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change did not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations but lowered our annual net periodic benefit cost by approximately $149 million in 2016. This change was treated as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, we did not adjust the amounts recorded in 2015 or 2014.\nInterest expense increased by $6 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest expense was substantially due to a reduction in the amount of net premium amortization recorded at acquisition due to the early retirement of several issuances of debt during the period, which has the effect of increasing interest expense and an increase in interest expense on unsecured notes related to the issuance of $1.0 billion of new debt in April, 2016 in advance of a debt maturity in June, 2016. Interest expense increased by $1 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to a reduction in the amortization of debt premiums, which was substantially offset by higher capitalized interest, lower bond coupon rates and lower interest under our Credit Facility. See Note 5-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report and Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information about our debt.\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of exposures to market risks. Actual values may differ materially from those disclosed by us from time to time if market conditions vary from the assumptions used in the analyses performed. These analyses only incorporate the risk exposures that existed at December 31, 2016.\nThe measurement of deferred taxes often involves the exercise of considerable judgment related to the realization of tax basis. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment that tax positions taken in filed tax returns and the resulting tax basis are more likely than not to be sustained if they are audited by taxing authorities. Assessing tax rates that we expect to apply and determining the years when the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income requires judgment about the future apportionment of our income among the states in which we operate. Any changes in our practices or judgments involved in the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nUpon being completed, this transaction will result in the Purchaser acquiring 57 data centers. This business generated revenues of $622 million, $626 million and $643 million (excluding revenue with affiliates) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively (a small portion of which will be retained by us). Based on certain estimates and assumptions regarding the closing date and various tax matters, we currently project that the net cash proceeds from the divestiture will be approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. We plan to use a portion of these net cash proceeds to partly fund our acquisition of Level 3.\nWe have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support and we do not engage in leasing, hedging or other similar activities that expose us to any significant liabilities that are not (i) reflected on the face of the consolidated financial statements, (ii) disclosed in Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, or in the Future Contractual Obligations table included in this Item 7 of Part II above, or (iii) discussed under the heading \"Market Risk\" above.\nIn 2014, approximately 16% of the qualified pension plans' January 1, 2014 net actuarial loss balance of $1.048 billion was subject to amortization as a component of net periodic expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits, which ranges from 8 to 9 years for the plans. The other 84% of the pension plans' beginning net actuarial loss balance was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2014. The entire beginning net actuarial loss of $37 million for the post-retirement benefit plans was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2014.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIncome tax expense decreased by $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Our income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $100 million from the amounts for the comparable prior year. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our effective income tax rate was 38.6%, 33.3% and 30.5%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflects a tax impact of $18 million from an intercompany dividend payment from one of our foreign subsidiaries to its domestic parent company that was made as part of our corporate restructuring in preparation for the sale of our colocation business. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects a tax benefit of approximately $34 million related to affiliate debt rationalization, research and development tax credits of $28 million for 2011 through 2015, and a $16 million tax decrease due to changes in state taxes caused by apportionment changes, state tax rate changes and the changes in the expected utilization of net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\"). The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects a $60 million tax benefit associated with a worthless stock deduction for the tax basis in a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary as a result of developments in bankruptcy proceedings involving its sole asset, an indirect investment in KPNQwest, N.V. The subsidiary was acquired as part of the acquisition of Qwest and we assigned it no fair value in the acquisition due to the bankruptcy proceedings, which were then ongoing. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 also reflects a $13 million tax decrease due to changes in state taxes caused by apportionment changes, state tax rate changes and the changes in the expected utilization of NOLs. The rate also reflects the absence of tax benefits from the impairment and disposition of our 700 MHz A-Block wireless spectrum licenses in 2014, because we are not likely to generate income of a character required to realize a tax benefit from the loss on disposition during the period permitted by law for utilization of that loss. See Note 13-Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report and \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Income Taxes\" below for additional information.\nBased on our current capital allocation objectives, during 2017 we anticipate expending approximately $2.6 billion of cash for capital investment in property, plant and equipment and up to $1.176 billion for dividends on our common stock, based on the current annual common stock dividend rate of $2.16 and the current number of outstanding common shares, assuming solely for these purposes no impact from the Level 3 acquisition. During 2017, we have debt maturities of $1.421 billion, scheduled debt principal payments of $22 million and capital lease and other fixed payments of approximately $100 million (including $41 million of capital lease obligations related to the colocation operations), excluding liabilities that we expect to assume later in 2017 in connection with consummating the Level 3 acquisition. Each of the expenditures are described further below.\nCost of Services and Products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nIn 2016, approximately 53% of the qualified pension plan's January 1, 2016 net actuarial loss balance of $2.843 billion was subject to amortization as a component of net periodic expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits, which ranges from 9 to 10 years for the plan. The other 47% of the qualified pension plan's beginning net actuarial loss balance was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2016. The entire beginning net actuarial loss of $147 million for the post-retirement benefit plans was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2016.\nDividends\nHistorical Information\nFinancing Activities\n \u2022 Operating efficiencies. We continue to evaluate our segment operating structure and focus. This involves balancing our workforce in response to our workload requirements, productivity improvements and changes in industry, competitive, technological and regulatory conditions. We also expect our consumer segment to benefit indirectly from enhanced efficiencies in our company-wide network operations.  The following tables summarize the results of operations from our consumer segment: \n \u2022 Consumer Segment. Consists generally of providing strategic and legacy products and services to residential customers. Our strategic products and services offered to these customers include our broadband, video (including our Prism TV services) and other ancillary services. Our legacy services offered to these customers include local and long-distance voice and other ancillary services. \nThe following table summarizes our estimated future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016: \nNet Operating Loss Carryforwards\nOther income, net reflects certain items not directly related to our core operations, including our share of income from partnerships we do not control, interest income, gains and losses from non-operating asset dispositions and foreign currency gains and losses. Other income, net decreased by $16 million, or 70%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in other income, net was primarily due to losses on early retirement of debt, which was partially offset by the impact of nonrecurring funding from a state economic development program. Other income, net increased by $12 million, or 109%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase in other income, net was primarily due to the impact of a 2014 impairment charge of $14 million recorded in connection with the sale of our 700 MHz A-Block Wireless Spectrum licenses, which was partially offset by a net loss on early retirement of debt in 2015.\nLoss Contingencies and Litigation Reserves\nBenefits paid by our qualified pension plan are paid through a trust that holds all of the plan's assets. Based on current laws and circumstances, we do not expect any contributions to be required for our qualified pension plan during 2017. The amount of required contributions to our qualified pension plan in 2018 and beyond will depend on a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control, including earnings on plan investments, prevailing interest rates, demographic experience, changes in plan benefits and changes in funding laws and regulations. We occasionally make voluntary contributions to the trust in addition to required contributions, including voluntary contributions in the amount of $100 million made in the third quarter of both 2016 and 2015. We currently expect to make a voluntary contribution of $100 million to the trust in 2017.\nCredit Facility\n______________________________________________________________________ \n \u2022 Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are expenses incurred in providing products and services to our customers. These expenses include: employee-related expenses directly attributable to operating and maintaining our network (such as salaries, wages, benefits and professional fees); facilities expenses (which include third-party telecommunications expenses we incur for using other carriers' networks to provide services to our customers); rents and utilities expenses; equipment sales expenses (such as data integration and modem expenses); payments to universal service funds (which are federal and state funds that are established to promote the availability of telecommunications services to all consumers at reasonable and affordable rates, among other things, and to which we are often required to contribute); certain litigation expenses associated with our operations; and other expenses directly related to our operations; and \nConsumer Segment\nDuring the last decade, we have experienced revenue declines primarily due to declines in access lines, private line customers, switched access rates and minutes of use. To mitigate these revenue declines, we remain focused on efforts to, among other things:\nPension and Post-retirement Benefit Obligations\n\nIncome Taxes\n \u2022 Legacy services. Our voice revenues have been, and we expect they will continue to be, adversely affected by access line losses and lower long-distance voice service volumes. Intense competition and product substitution continue to drive our access line losses. For example, many consumers are substituting cable and wireless voice services and electronic mail, texting and social networking non-voice services for traditional voice telecommunications services. We expect that these factors will continue to negatively impact our business. As a result of the expected loss of higher margin services associated with access lines, we continue to offer our customers service bundling and other product promotions to help mitigate this trend, as described below. Customer migration and price compression from competitive pressures have not only negatively impacted our legacy revenues, but they have also negatively impacted the operating margins of our legacy services and we expect this trend to continue. Operating costs, such as installation costs and facility costs, have also negatively impacted the operating margins of our legacy services, but to a lesser extent than customer migration and price compression. Operating costs also tend to impact our legacy services margins to a lesser extent than our strategic services as noted above; \nWe are required to reassign goodwill to reporting units each time we reorganize our internal reporting structure which causes a change in the composition of our reporting units. We assign goodwill to the reporting units using a relative fair value approach. We utilize the trailing twelve months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as our allocation methodology as we believe that it represents a reasonable proxy for the fair value of the operations being reorganized. The use of other fair value assignment methods could result in materially different results. For additional information on our segments, see Note 14-Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.\n (1) We define a data center as any facility where we market, sell and deliver either colocation services, multi-tenant managed services, or both. Our data centers are located in North America, Europe and Asia.  See Note 3-Pending Sale of Colocation Business and Data Centers to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information on the pending sale.\n______________________________________________________________________ \nAt December 31, 2016, CenturyLink, Inc. owed $336 million under a term loan maturing in 2019 and Qwest Corporation owed $100 million under a term loan maturing in 2025. Both of these term loans include covenants substantially similar to those set forth in the Credit Facility.\nIn February 2015, the FCC adopted new regulations that regulate broadband services as a public utility service under Title II of the Communications Act. In light of pending litigation and changes in the composition of the FCC, we believe it is premature for us to determine the ultimate impact of the new regulations on our operations. For additional information, see Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters\u201d in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report.\nLevel 3 Financing Commitment Letter\n \u2022 Strategic services. In order to remain competitive and attract additional residential broadband subscribers, we believe it is important to continually increase our broadband network's scope and connection speeds. As a result, we continue to invest in our broadband network, which allows for the delivery of higher-speed broadband services to a greater number of customers. We compete in a maturing broadband market in which most consumers already have broadband services and growth rates in new subscribers have slowed. Moreover, as described further in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report, certain of our competitors continue to provide broadband services at higher average transmission speeds than ours or through advanced wireless data service offerings, both of which we believe have impacted the competitiveness of certain of our broadband offerings. The offering of our facilities-based video services in our markets requires us to incur substantial start-up expenses in advance of marketing and selling the service. Also, our associated content costs continue to increase and the video business has become more competitive as more options become available to customers to access video services through new technologies. The demand for new technology has increased the number of competitors offering strategic services similar to ours. Price compression and new technology from our competitors have negatively impacted the operating margins of our strategic services and we expect this trend to continue. Operating costs also impact the operating margins of our strategic services. These operating costs include employee costs, marketing and advertising expenses, sales commissions, Prism TV content costs and installation costs. We believe increases in operating costs have generally had a greater impact on our operating margins of our strategic services as compared to our legacy services, principally because our strategic services rely more heavily upon the above-listed costs; \nIn connection with entering into our merger agreement with Level 3, we obtained a debt commitment letter from a group of lenders. See Note 5-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, for additional information on the financing commitment letter.\nFuture Contractual Obligations\nPending Sale of Colocation Business and Data Centers\nSegment Expenses\nSee Note 5-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, for additional information on our outstanding debt securities.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nWe currently categorize our products, services and revenues among the following four categories:\nPotential Impact of the Pending Acquisition of Level 3\nThe operations of our consumer segment have been impacted by several significant trends, including those described below:\n (2) Actual principal and interest paid in all years may differ due to future refinancing of outstanding debt or issuance of new debt. Interest on our floating rate debt was calculated for all years using the rates effective at December 31, 2016. Also, includes interest and executory costs of $93 million associated with our capital lease obligations related to our colocation operations. See Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information regarding the future commitments for capital leases related to our colocation operations. \n\nFor matters related to income taxes, if we determine in our judgment that the impact of an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority, then we recognize in our financial statements a benefit for the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if we determine in our judgment that the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Though the validity of any tax position is a matter of tax law, the body of statutory, regulatory and interpretive guidance on the application of the law is complex and often ambiguous. Because of this, whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $141 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 substantially due to an increase in payments for property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $224 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a decrease in payments of property, plant and equipment and amounts paid for acquisitions in 2015.\n \u2022 Legacy services. We continue to experience customers migrating away from our higher margin legacy services into lower margin strategic services. Our legacy services revenues have been, and we expect they will continue to be, adversely affected by access line losses and price compression. In particular, our access, local services and long-distance revenues have been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by customer migration to more technologically advanced services, an increase in the use of non-voice communications and a related decrease in the demand for traditional voice services, industry consolidation and price compression caused by regulation and rate reductions. For example, many of our business segment customers are substituting cable, wireless and VoIP services for traditional voice telecommunications services, resulting in continued access revenue loss. Demand for our private line services (including special access) continues to decline due to our customers' optimization of their networks, industry consolidation and technological migration to higher-speed services. Although our legacy services generally face fewer direct competitors than certain of our strategic services, customer migration and, to a lesser degree, price compression from competitive pressures have negatively impacted our legacy revenues and the operating margins of our legacy services. We expect this trend to continue. Operating costs, such as installation costs and third-party facility costs, have also negatively impacted the operating margins of our legacy services, but to a lesser extent than customer loss, customer migration and price compression. Operating costs also tend to impact our legacy services to a lesser extent than our strategic services as noted above; \nCompletion of the transaction is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, as well as approvals from the Federal Communications Commission (the \"FCC\") and certain state regulatory authorities. The transaction is also subject to the approval of CenturyLink and Level 3 shareholders at meetings scheduled to be held on March 16, 2017, as well as other customary closing conditions. Subject to these conditions, we anticipate closing this transaction by the end of the third quarter 2017. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay Level 3 a termination fee of $472 million, or Level 3 may be obligated to pay CenturyLink a termination fee of $738 million.\nWe have a $160 million uncommitted revolving letter of credit facility which enables us to provide letters of credit under terms that may be more favorable than those under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2016, our outstanding letters of credit totaled $105 million under this facility.\nManagement periodically reviews our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and periodically implements strategies to manage the exposure. From time to time, we have used derivative instruments to (i) lock-in or swap our exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2016, we had no such instruments outstanding. We have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n \u2022 increase the capacity, speed and usage of our networks; and \nAs of October 31, 2016, we assessed goodwill for impairment for our three reporting units, which we determined to be business (excluding wholesale), consumer and wholesale and determined that the estimated fair value of our wholesale reporting unit was substantially in excess of our carrying value of equity and the estimated fair value of our business and consumer reporting units exceeded our carrying value of equity by 28% and 18%, respectively.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn computing our pension and post-retirement health care and life insurance benefit obligations, our most significant assumptions are the discount rate and mortality rates. In computing our periodic pension and post-retirement benefit expense, our most significant assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets.\n \u2022 Data integration. We expect both data integration revenue and the related costs will fluctuate from year to year as this offering tends to be more sensitive than others to changes in the economy and in spending trends of our federal, state and local governmental customers, many of whom have experienced substantial budget cuts over the past several years, with the possibility of additional future budget cuts. Our data integration operating margins are typically smaller than most of our other offerings; and \nTerm Loans and Revolving Letter of Credit\n \u2022 promote long-term relationships with our customers through bundling of integrated services; \nOther Income, Net\nAllocation of Revenues and Expenses\n \u2022 certain post-retirement benefits payable to certain eligible current and future retirees. Not all of our post-retirement benefit obligation amount is a contractual obligation and only the portion that we believe is a contractual obligation is reported in the table. See additional information on our benefits plans in Note 9-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report; \nOperating Activities\nBusiness segment revenues decreased by $294 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in business segment revenues was primarily due to declines in our legacy services revenues. The decline in legacy services revenues was attributable to a reduction in local service access lines and lower volumes of long-distance and access services for the reasons noted above and to reductions in the volume of private line (including special access) services. The increase in our strategic services revenues was primarily due to increases in MPLS unit growth and higher Ethernet and VOIP volumes, which were partially offset by declines in our hosting services. The decrease in our data integration revenues was primarily due to lower sales of customer premises equipment to governmental and business customers and to declines in maintenance services. Business segment revenues decreased by $384 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in business segment revenues was primarily due to declines in legacy services revenues and data integration revenues, which were partially offset by the growth in our strategic services revenues. The decline in legacy services revenues was attributable to a reduction in local service access lines and lower volumes of long-distance, access and traditional WAN services for the reasons noted above and a reduction in private line (including special access) volumes, as well as a pricing reduction on private line services for a large wholesale customer in exchange for a longer term commitment. The growth in our strategic services revenues was primarily due to MPLS unit growth and higher Ethernet volumes, which were partially offset by a reduction in hosting services. The decrease in data integration revenues was primarily due to lower sales of customer premises equipment to governmental and business customers during the period.\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate long-term debt obligations and fluctuations in certain foreign currencies. We seek to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nConnect America Fund\n \u2022 Business Segment. Consists generally of providing strategic, legacy and data integration products and services to small, medium and enterprise business, wholesale and governmental customers, including other communication providers. Our strategic products and services offered to these customers include our MPLS, Ethernet, colocation, hosting (including cloud hosting and managed hosting), broadband, VoIP, information technology and other ancillary services. Our legacy services offered to these customers primarily include local and long-distance voice, including the sale of unbundled network elements (\"UNEs\"), private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services. Our data integration offerings include the sale of telecommunications equipment located on customers' premises and related products and professional services, all of which are described further below under the heading \"Operating Revenues\"; and \n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Access lines are lines reaching from the customers' premises to a connection with the public network and broadband subscribers are customers that purchase broadband connection service through their existing telephone lines, stand-alone telephone lines, or fiber-optic cables. Our methodology for counting our access lines and broadband subscribers includes only those lines that we use to provide services to external customers and excludes lines used solely by us and our affiliates. It also excludes unbundled loops and includes stand-alone broadband subscribers. We count lines when we install the service. \nOur goodwill was derived from numerous acquisitions where the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired.\nOn September 19, 2016, a subsidiary of Embarq Corporation redeemed all of its 8.77% Notes due 2017, which was less than $4 million and resulted in an immaterial loss.\nSubject to market conditions, we expect to continue to issue debt securities from time to time in the future to refinance a substantial portion of our maturing debt, including issuing Qwest Corporation debt securities to refinance its maturing debt to the extent feasible. The availability, interest rate and other terms of any new borrowings will depend on the ratings assigned to us and Qwest Corporation by credit rating agencies, among other factors. For further information on our debt maturities, see \"Future Contractual Obligations\" below.\nInvesting Activities\nWe sponsor a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (referred to as our qualified pension plan) for a substantial portion of our employees. In addition to this tax-qualified pension plan, we also maintain several non-qualified pension plans for certain eligible highly compensated employees. We also maintain post-retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retirees.\n______________________________________________________________________\nIn computing the amount of revenue to recognize, we assume that we will not be able to economically enable 100% of the required living units in every state with voice and broadband capabilities under the CAF Phase 2 program. We defer recognition of the funds related to potential living units that we estimate we will not enable until we can with reasonable assurance determine that we can fully meet the enablement targets. As disclosed elsewhere herein, in some limited instances, a portion of the funds must be returned if enablement targets are not attained. Based on estimated enablement, the effect of a hypothetical 1% decrease in our estimate of living units we will not enable with voice and broadband capabilities under the CAF Phase 2 program would have increased our revenue by $3 million in 2016 and a 1% increase would have decreased our revenue by $9 million in 2016.\nOverview\nAt December 31, 2016, we held cash and cash equivalents of $222 million and we had $1.630 billion of borrowing capacity available under our $2 billion amended and restated revolving credit facility (referred to as our \"Credit Facility\", which is described further below). At December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents of $44 million were held in foreign bank accounts for the purpose of funding our foreign operations. Due to various factors, our access to foreign cash is generally much more restricted than our access to domestic cash.\nAs a result of accepting CAF Phase 2 support payments for 33 states, we will be obligated to make substantial capital expenditures to build broadband infrastructure over the next several years. See \"Capital Expenditures\" above.\nBusiness segment expenses decreased by $37 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in our business segment expenses was primarily due to decreases in salaries and wages, professional fees and payment processing fees, which were partially offset by increases in facility costs, network expense and real estate and power costs. Business segment expenses decreased by $52 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower customer premises equipment costs resulting from the lower sales noted above in segment revenues. Excluding the lower customer premises equipment costs, business expenses increased by $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due to increases in salaries and wages, benefits expense, external commissions, network expense and facility costs, which were partially offset by decreases in professional fees, materials and supplies and fleet expenses.\nResults of Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn recent years, we have been using Net Operating Loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards to offset a large portion of our federal taxable income. As of December 31, 2016, we have substantially utilized our federal NOL carryforwards. A portion of these remaining NOL carryforwards are subject to the limitations imposed by section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\"Code\"). As a result of the substantial utilization of the NOL carryforwards in prior years and the limitations imposed on portions of the remaining NOL carryforward balance, the amounts of our cash flows dedicated to or required for the payment of federal taxes has increased and is expected to continue to increase substantially during 2017 prior to our anticipated acquisition of additional NOLs later this year, as described further below. The amounts of our near-term tax payments will depend upon many factors, including our future earnings and tax circumstances. Based on current laws (including the extension of bonus depreciation) and our current estimates of 2017 earnings, we estimate our cash income tax liability related to 2017 will be between $500 million to $600 million, exclusive of (i) tax payments relating to the sale of our data centers and colocation business of approximately $100 million to $200 million, which we anticipate will be triggered by certain corporate restructuring actions we are taking in the first quarter of 2017 regarding certain subsidiaries involved in the colocation business and (ii) the impact of acquiring Level 3.\nWe are aggressively marketing our strategic services in an effort to partially offset the continuing declines in our legacy services.\n \u2022 Other operating revenues, which consists primarily of Connect America Fund (\"CAF\") support payments, Universal Service Fund (\"USF\") support payments and USF surcharges. We receive federal support payments from both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the CAF program, and support payments from both federal and state USF programs. These support payments are government subsidies designed to reimburse us for various costs related to certain telecommunications services, including the costs of deploying, maintaining and operating voice and broadband infrastructure in high-cost rural areas where we are not able to fully recover our costs from our customers. We also collect USF surcharges based on specific items we list on our customers' invoices to fund the FCC's universal service programs. We also generate other operating revenues from the leasing and subleasing of space in our office buildings, warehouses and other properties. Because we centrally manage the activities that generate these other operating revenues, these revenues are not included in our segment revenues. \nThe operations of our business segment have been impacted by several significant trends, including those described below:\n (2) During 2016, we recognized $189 million of severance expenses and other one-time termination benefits associated with our workforce reductions and $52 million of expenses related to our pending acquisition of Level 3. \nUpon completion of the acquisition, Level 3's assets and liabilities will be revalued and recorded at fair value. The assignment of fair value will require a significant amount of judgment. The use of fair value measures will affect the comparability of our post-acquisition financial information and may make it more difficult to predict earnings in future periods. For example, Level 3 has certain deferred costs and deferred revenues on its balance sheet associated with capacity leases. Based on the accounting guidance for business combinations, these existing deferred costs and deferred revenues are expected to be assigned little or no value in the purchase price allocation process and will thus be eliminated.\nChanges in any of the above factors could significantly impact operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive (loss) income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as well as the value of the liability and accumulated other comprehensive loss of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheets. The expected return on plan assets is reflected as a reduction to our pension and post-retirement benefit expense. If our assumed expected rates of return for 2016 were 100 basis points lower, our qualified pension and post-retirement benefit expenses for 2016 would have increased by $92 million. If our assumed discount rates for 2016 were 100 basis points lower, our qualified pension and post-retirement benefit expenses for 2016 would have increased by $46 million and our projected benefit obligation for 2016 would have increased by approximately $1.753 billion.\n \u2022 contract termination fees. These fees are non-recurring payments, the timing and payment of which, if any, is uncertain. In the ordinary course of business and to optimize our cost structure, we enter into contracts with terms greater than one year to use the network facilities of other carriers and to purchase other goods and services. Our contracts to use other carriers' network facilities generally have no minimum volume requirements and pricing is based upon volumes and usage. Assuming we terminate these contracts in 2017, the contract termination fees would be $359 million. Under the same assumption, we estimate that our termination fees for these contracts to purchase goods and services would be $165 million. In the normal course of business, we do not believe payment of these fees is likely; \nOur current definitions of operating expenses are as follows:\n \u2022 service level commitments to our customers, the violation of which typically results in service credits rather than cash payments; and \nUnder the Credit Facility, we, and our indirect subsidiary, Qwest Corporation, must maintain a debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined in our Credit Facility) ratio of not more than 4.0:1.0 and 2.85:1.0, respectively, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter for the four quarters then ended. The Credit Facility also contains a negative pledge covenant, which generally requires us to secure equally and ratably any advances under the Credit Facility if we pledge assets or permit liens on our property for the benefit of other debtholders. The Credit Facility also has a cross payment default provision, and the Credit Facility and certain of our debt securities also have cross acceleration provisions. When present, these provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. Our debt to EBITDA ratios could be adversely affected by a wide variety of events, including unforeseen expenses or contingencies. This could reduce our financing flexibility due to potential restrictions on incurring additional debt under certain provisions of our debt agreements or, in certain circumstances, could result in a default under certain provisions of such agreements.\nOur $2 billion Credit Facility matures on December 3, 2019 and has 16 lenders, each with commitments ranging from $3.5 million to $198.5 million. The Credit Facility allows us to obtain revolving loans and to issue up to $400 million of letters of credit, which upon issuance reduces the amount available for other extensions of credit. Interest is assessed on borrowings using either the LIBOR or the base rate (each as defined in the Credit Facility) plus an applicable margin between 1.00% and 2.25% per annum for LIBOR loans and 0.00% and 1.25% per annum for base rate loans depending on our then current senior unsecured long-term debt rating. Our obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by nine of our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2016, we had $370 million in borrowings and no amounts of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility.\nOperating Expenses\nOn October 31, 2016, we entered into a definitive merger agreement under which we propose to acquire Level 3 Communications, Inc. ( Level 3\u201d) in a cash and stock transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, Level 3 shareholders will receive $26.50 per share in cash and 1.4286 of CenturyLink shares for each share of Level 3 common stock they own at closing. CenturyLink shareholders are expected to own approximately 51% and Level 3 shareholders are expected to own approximately 49% of the combined company at closing. On December 31, 2016, Level 3 had outstanding $10.9 billion of long-term debt.\n \u2022 Service bundling and product promotions. We offer our customers the ability to bundle multiple products and services. These customers can bundle broadband services with other services such as local voice, video, long-distance and wireless. While we believe our bundled service offerings can help retain customers, they also tend to lower our profit margins in the consumer segment due to the related discounts; and \n \u2022 Operating efficiencies. We continue to evaluate our segment operating structure and focus. This involves balancing our workforce in response to our workload requirements, productivity improvements and changes in industry, competitive, technological and regulatory conditions, while achieving operational efficiencies and improving our processes through automation. However, our ongoing efforts to increase revenue will continue to require that we incur higher costs in some areas. We also expect our business segment to benefit indirectly from enhanced efficiencies in our company-wide network operations. \nAnnual depreciation expense is impacted by several factors, including changes in our depreciable cost basis, changes in our estimates of the remaining economic life of certain network assets, the addition of new plant and our entry into an agreement to sell our data centers and colocation business. Depreciation expense decreased by $145 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased by $122 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The depreciation expense related to our plant was lower for both periods due to full depreciation and retirement of certain plant placed in service prior to 2016 and 2015. Additionally, we ceased depreciating property, plant and equipment assets of our colocation business when we entered into the agreement to sell that business. We estimate that we would have recorded additional depreciation expense during 2016 of $30 million if we had not agreed to sell the colocation business. The decrease in both periods was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense attributable to new plant placed in service during the respective years.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately $19.6 billion (excluding capital lease and other obligations with a carrying amount of $440 million) of long-term debt outstanding, approximately 96% of which bears interest at fixed rates and is therefore not exposed to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2016, we had $806 million floating rate debt exposed to changes in either the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the Prime Rate. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in LIBOR relative to this debt would decrease our annual pre-tax earnings by $8 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased by $783 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a reduction of common stock repurchases. Net cash used in financing activities increased by $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to additional common stock repurchases. Net debt repayments have been about the same for all three years.\nFor additional information about the CAF Phase 2 support program, see the discussion below in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Connect America Fund.\"\nFor 2017, our estimated annual long-term rates of return are 6.5% and 5.0% for the pension plan trust assets and post-retirement plans' trust assets, respectively, based on the assets currently held. However, actual returns could be substantially different.\n \u2022 Legacy services, which include primarily local and long-distance voice services, including the sale of UNEs, private line (including special access), Integrated Services Digital Network (\"ISDN\") (which use regular telephone lines to support voice, video and data applications), switched access and other ancillary services; \n (1) On March 15, 2016, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. downgraded CenturyLink, Inc.'s rating from Ba2 to Ba3 and downgraded Qwest Corporation's rating from Baa3 to Ba1.  Our credit ratings are reviewed and adjusted from time to time by the rating agencies, and downgrades of CenturyLink, Inc.'s senior unsecured debt ratings could, under certain circumstances, incrementally increase the cost of our borrowing under the Credit Facility. Moreover, any additional downgrades of CenturyLink, Inc.'s or Qwest Corporation's senior unsecured debt ratings could impact our access to debt capital or further raise our borrowing costs. See \"Risk Factors-Risks Affecting our Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had recognized $52 million of expenses associated with our activities related to the pending Level 3 acquisition. We have not recognized certain other expenses that are contingent on completion of the acquisition. These expenses include financial advisory fees and compensation expense comprised of retention bonuses, severance and stock-based compensation for stock-based awards that will vest in connection with the acquisition. Most of these contingent expenses will be recognized in our consolidated financial statements in the period in which the acquisition occurs, with the remainder recognized thereafter. The final amount of compensation expense to be recognized is partially dependent upon personnel decisions that will be made as part of integration planning. These amounts may be material.\nFor additional information on the FCC's CAF order and the USF program, see \"Business-Regulation\" in Item 1 of Part I of this annual report and see \"Risk Factors-Risks Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report.\n \u2022 Strategic services. Our mix of total business segment revenues continues to migrate from legacy services to strategic services as our small, medium and enterprise business, wholesale and governmental customers increasingly demand integrated data, broadband, hosting and voice services. Our Ethernet-based services in the wholesale market face competition from cable companies and competitive fiber-based telecommunications providers. We anticipate continued pricing pressure for our colocation services as vendors continue to expand their enterprise colocation operations. In recent years, our competitors, as well as several large, diversified technology companies, have made substantial investments in cloud computing. This expansion in competitive cloud computing offerings has led to increased pricing pressure, a migration towards lower-priced cloud-based services and enhanced competition for contracts, and we expect these trends to continue. Customers' demand for new technology has also increased the number of competitors offering strategic services similar to ours. Price compression from each of these above-mentioned competitive pressures has negatively impacted the operating margins of our strategic services, and we expect this trend to continue. Operating costs also impact the operating margins of our strategic services, but to a lesser extent than price compression and customer disconnects. These operating costs include employee costs, sales commissions, software costs on selected services, installation costs and third-party facility costs. We believe increases in operating costs have generally had a greater impact on the operating margins of our strategic services as compared to our legacy services, principally because our strategic services rely more heavily upon the above-listed support functions; \nWe may be required to assess our goodwill for impairment before our next required assessment date of October 31, 2017 under certain circumstances, including any failure to meet our forecasted future operating results or any significant increases in our weighted average cost of capital. In addition, we cannot assure that adverse conditions will not trigger future goodwill impairment assessments or impairment charges. A number of factors, many of which we cannot control, could affect our financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause our actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed in our goodwill impairment assessment. These factors include, but are not limited to, (i) further weakening in the overall economy; (ii) a significant decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization as a result of an adverse change to our overall business operations; (iii) changes in the discount rate we use in our testing; (iv) successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets; (v) adverse changes as a result of regulatory or legislative actions; (vi) a significant adverse change in our legal affairs or in the overall business climate; and (vii) recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of one or more of our subsidiaries that are a component of our segments. For additional information, see \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report. We will continue to monitor certain events that impact our operations to determine if an interim assessment of goodwill impairment should be performed prior to the next required assessment date of October 31, 2017.\nConnect America Fund\nBusiness Segment\nWe have cash management arrangements with certain of our principal subsidiaries, in which substantial portions of the subsidiaries' cash is regularly advanced to us. Although we periodically repay these advances to fund the subsidiaries' cash requirements throughout the year, at any given point in time we may owe a substantial sum to our subsidiaries under these advances, which, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, are eliminated in consolidation and therefore not recognized on our consolidated balance sheets.\n \u2022 provide a wide array of diverse services, including enhanced or additional services that may become available in the future due to, among other things, advances in technology or improvements in our infrastructure; \nIf, as anticipated, we complete the acquisition of Level 3 by the end of third quarter of 2017 in the manner discussed in Note 2-Pending Acquisition of Level 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, we expect our operations, financial position and cash flows to be significantly impacted following the closing of the transaction. We expect to issue a significant amount of new debt to finance the Level 3 acquisition, and we would assume approximately $10.9 billion of Level 3's outstanding debt upon consummating the acquisition. With this additional debt, we would expect our cash paid for interest payments to be significantly higher following the closing of the transaction. We project that our capital expenditures would increase significantly; we anticipate, based on information included in Level 3's annual guidance regarding its estimated 2017 capital expenditures, that Level 3 will spend approximately $100 million to $125 million per month on average, in the period prior to closing, but that amount could be significantly different than amounts that we expect to spend in the months following the closing of the transaction. In connection with consummating the acquisition, we would expect to issue approximately 538 million shares of our common stock to Level 3 stockholders (including shares of CenturyLink common stock expected to be issued in exchange for outstanding Level 3 equity awards), based on the number of Level 3 shares held of record on January 27, 2017. Based on our current quarterly common stock dividend rate of $0.54 per share, this issuance of additional shares would result in an additional incremental dividend payment of approximately $290 million per quarter. Also, we expect our upcoming cash payments for transaction costs, integration costs and debt financing costs to be material primarily following the closing of the transaction. These above factors are expected to result in a net cash outflow for the period of 2017 following the closing. However, we expect we will have sufficient liquidity to more than offset the impact of the net cash outflows.\n\nOur executive officers and our Board of Directors periodically review our sources and potential uses of cash in connection with our annual budgeting process. Generally speaking, our principal funding source is cash from operating activities, and our principal cash requirements include operating expenses, capital expenditures, income taxes, debt repayments, dividends, periodic stock repurchases, periodic pension contributions and other benefits payments. As discussed below, the amount we pay for income taxes is expected to increase for most of 2017, and the amount we pay for retiree healthcare benefits is expected to increase substantially in 2017. The potential impact of the pending sale of our colocation business and data centers and the potential impact of the pending acquisition of Level 3 are further described below.\nFor 2016, the growth in our strategic services revenues was primarily due to increased demand for our Ethernet, MPLS, facilities-based video and VoIP services and from rate increases on various services, which were partially offset by declines in our hosting services and losses of broadband customers. For 2015, the growth in our strategic services revenues was primarily due to increased demand for our Ethernet, MPLS, facilities-based video and IT Services and from rate increases on various services, which were partially offset by declines in our colocation and hosting services.\nSegment Income\nWe also are involved in various legal proceedings that could substantially impact our financial position. See Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for the current status of such legal proceedings.\nOn April 6, 2016, CenturyLink, Inc. issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 7.5% Notes due 2024, in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and other expenses, of $988 million.\nWe incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis in order to enhance and modernize our networks, compete effectively in our markets and expand our service offerings. We evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted impact on revenue growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention) and our expected return on investment. The amount of capital investment is influenced by, among other things, demand for our services and products, cash flow generated by operating activities, cash required for other purposes and regulatory considerations (such as our CAF Phase 2 infrastructure buildout requirements). Based on current circumstances, we estimate that our total capital expenditures for 2017 will be approximately $2.6 billion, inclusive of CAF Phase 2 related capital expenditures, but exclusive of additional capital expenditures with respect to the Level 3 operations that we expect to acquire later this year.\nSegment Results\n\n (5) Reflects only the portion of total obligation that is contractual in nature. See Note 7 below. \nOur segment revenues include all revenues from our strategic services, legacy services and data integration as described in more detail above. Segment revenues are based upon each customer's classification to an individual segment. We report our segment revenues based upon all services provided to that segment's customers. For information on how we allocate expenses to our segments, as well as other additional information about our segments, see Note 14-Segment Information.\n \u2022 provide our broadband and premium services to a higher percentage of our customers; \nOn May 2, 2016, Qwest Corporation paid at maturity the $235 million principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest due under its 8.375% Notes.\n (1) Includes current maturities and capital lease obligations, but excludes unamortized discounts, net and unamortized debt issuance costs. Also, includes $305 million of capital lease obligations related to our colocation operations. See Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information regarding the future commitments for capital leases related to our colocation operations. \nOn August 29, 2016, Qwest Corporation redeemed all $661 million of its 7.375% Notes due 2051, which resulted in a loss of $18 million.\nOn November 3, 2016, we entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement to sell our data centers and colocation business to a consortium led by BC Partners, Inc. and Medina Capital (\"the Purchaser\") in exchange for cash and a minority stake in the consortium's newly-formed global secure infrastructure company. During 2016, as a result of the pending sale, the assets to be sold to the Purchaser have been reclassified as assets held for sale in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the liabilities to be assumed by the Purchaser have been reclassified and presented as current liabilities associated with assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet. As part of the transaction, the Purchaser will assume our capital lease obligations, which amounted to $305 million as of December 31, 2016, related to the properties that we will sell. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals, including a review by the Committee of Foreign Investments in the United States, as well as other customary closing conditions.\nWe perform annual internal reviews to evaluate the reasonableness of the depreciable lives for our property, plant and equipment. Our reviews utilize models that take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history, assumptions about technology evolution and, in certain instances, actuarially determined probabilities to estimate the remaining life of our asset base.\nWe are an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing an array of services to our residential and business customers. Our communications services include local and long-distance voice, broadband, Multi-Protocol Label Switching (\"MPLS\"), private line (including special access), Ethernet, colocation, hosting (including cloud hosting and managed hosting), data integration, video, network, public access, Voice over Internet Protocol (\"VoIP\"), information technology and other ancillary services. We strive to maintain our customer relationships by, among other things, bundling our service offerings to provide our customers with a complete offering of integrated communications services.\nConsumer segment revenues decreased by $119 million, or 2%, for year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in our consumer segment revenues was primarily due to the declines in our legacy services revenues, which were partially offset by increases in our strategic revenues. The decline in our legacy services revenues for both periods was primarily due to lower local and long-distance voice service volumes associated with access line losses resulting from the competitive and technological factors noted above. The increase in our strategic services revenues was primarily due to 2016 rate increases resulting from various pricing initiatives on broadband, Prism TV and other strategic products and services, and increases in the number of our Prism TV customers, which were partially offset by a decline in broadband customers. Consumer segment revenues increased by $24 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in strategic services revenues was primarily due to increases in the number of Prism TV customers, as well as from 2015 price increases on various services. The decline in legacy services revenues was primarily due to declines in local and long-distance services volumes associated with access line losses resulting from the competitive and technological factors as further described above.\nAdditionally, in 2015, the lower depreciation expense was further offset by the impact of changes in the estimated lives of certain property, plant and equipment which resulted in additional depreciation. The changes in the estimated lives of certain property, plant and equipment resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $48 million for 2015, which was more than fully offset by the decrease in depreciation expense noted above. In addition, we developed a plan to migrate customers from one of our networks to another, which began in late 2014 and ended in late 2015. As a result, we implemented changes in estimates that reduced the remaining economic lives of certain network assets. The impact from the above-noted changes in estimates and network migration resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $90 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have identified certain policies and estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our past or present results of operations related to (i) goodwill, customer relationships and other intangible assets; (ii) property, plant and equipment; (iii) pension and post-retirement benefits; (iv) loss contingencies and litigation reserves; (v) Connect America Fund; and (vi) income taxes. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or they have the potential to have a material impact, on our consolidated financial statements and because they require us to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions made when accounting for the items described below were reasonable, based on information available at the time they were made. However, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) During 2016 and 2015, we recognized an incremental $201 million and $215 million, respectively, of revenue associated with the FCC's Connect America Fund Phase 2 support program as compared to the interstate USF program. For additional information, see Note 1-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. \n \u2022 Strategic services, which include primarily broadband, MPLS, Ethernet, colocation, hosting (including cloud hosting and managed hosting), video (including our facilities-based video services, which we offer in 16 markets), VoIP, information technology and other ancillary services; \nOur provision for income taxes includes amounts for tax consequences deferred to future periods. We record deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflecting future tax consequences attributable to tax credit carryforwards, differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and the tax bases of those assets and liabilities and tax net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs. Deferred taxes are computed using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.\n \u2022 increase prices on our products and services if and when practicable; \nWe amortize customer relationships primarily over an estimated life of 10 to 15 years, using either the sum-of-the-years-digits or the straight-line methods, depending on the type of customer. We amortize capitalized software using the straight-line method over estimated lives ranging up to 7 years, except for approximately $237 million of our capitalized software costs, which represents costs to develop an integrated billing and customer care system which is amortized using the straight-line method over a 20 year period. We annually review the estimated lives and methods used to amortize our other intangible assets, primarily capitalized software. The amount of future amortization expense may differ materially from current amounts, depending on the results of our annual reviews.\nThe following tables present additional metrics related to our data centers: \nOn December 23, 2016, a subsidiary of Embarq Corporation redeemed $5 million of its 8.375% Notes due 2025, which resulted in an immaterial loss.\nPending Acquisition of Level 3\nInterest Expense\nOn January 29, 2016, Qwest Corporation issued $235 million aggregate principal amount of 7% Notes due 2056, in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and other expenses, of $227 million.\nWe are organized into operating segments based on customer type, business and consumer. These operating segments are our two reportable segments in our consolidated financial statements:\nIn 2015, approximately 45% of the qualified pension plan's January 1, 2015 net actuarial loss balance of $2.740 billion was subject to amortization as a component of net periodic expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits, which ranges from 8 to 9 years for the plan. The other 55% of the qualified pension plan's beginning net actuarial loss balance was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2015. The entire beginning net actuarial loss of $277 million for the post-retirement benefit plans was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2015.\n \u2022 pursue acquisitions of additional assets if available at attractive prices; \nWe currently expect to continue our current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends in respect of our common stock subject to our Board of Directors' discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Our current quarterly common stock dividend rate is $0.54 per share, as approved by our Board of Directors, which we believe is a dividend rate per share that gives us the flexibility to balance our multiple objectives of managing our business, paying our fixed commitments and returning cash to our shareholders. Assuming continued payment during 2017 at this rate of $0.54 per share, our average total dividends paid each quarter prior to the Level 3 acquisition would be approximately $294 million based on our current number of outstanding shares (which does not reflect shares that we expect to issue in connection with the Level 3 acquisition or any other shares that we might issue or repurchase in future periods). See \"Risk Factors-Risks Affecting Our Business\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report.\nDebt and Other Financing Arrangements\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $121 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in severance expenses associated with our recent workforce reduction, higher payments of employee health care claims, bad debt and other expenses (including fees related to the Level 3 acquisition), which were partially offset by reductions in professional fees and property and other taxes. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $19 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower benefit expenses, insurance costs and asset impairment charges. These decreases were partially offset by increases in bad debt expense, external commissions and regulatory fines of $15 million associated with a 911 system outage.\n \u2022 Selling, general and administrative expenses are corporate overhead and other operating expenses. These expenses include: employee-related expenses (such as salaries, wages, internal commissions, benefits and professional fees) directly attributable to selling products or services and employee-related expenses for administrative functions; marketing and advertising; property and other operating taxes and fees; external commissions; litigation expenses associated with general matters; bad debt expense; and other selling, general and administrative expenses.  These expense classifications may not be comparable to those of other companies.\nWe are subject to material obligations under our existing defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement benefit plans. At December 31, 2016, the accounting unfunded status of our qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans and qualified post-retirement benefit plans was $2.409 billion and $3.360 billion, respectively. See Note 9-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information about our pension and post-retirement benefit arrangements.\nIn response to the continued decline of our legacy services revenues and to better align our workforce with our workload requirements, we periodically implement workforce reduction programs. In the third quarter of 2016, we announced plans to reduce our workforce, initially through voluntary severance packages and the balance through involuntary reductions. We recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016 a charge for severance expenses and other one-time termination benefits of $164 million, $98 million of which remained to be paid as of December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2016, we operated approximately 11.1 million access lines in 37 states and served approximately 5.9 million broadband subscribers and 325 thousand Prism TV subscribers. We also operated 58 data centers throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Our methodology for counting access lines, broadband subscribers and data centers, which is described further in the operational metrics table below under \"Results of Operations\", and our methodology for counting Prism TV subscribers may not be comparable to those of other companies.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe will continue to monitor our future sources and uses of cash, and anticipate that we will make adjustments to our capital allocation strategies when, as and if determined by our Board of Directors. We typically use our revolving credit facility as a source of liquidity for operating activities and our other cash requirements.\nFrom time to time, we change the categorization of our products and services, and we may make similar changes in the future. During the second quarter of 2016, we determined that because of declines due to customer migration to other strategic products and services, certain of our business low-bandwidth data services, specifically our private line (including special access) services in our business segment, are more closely aligned with our legacy services than with our strategic services. As described in greater detail in Note 14-Segment Information in our Notes, these operating revenues are now reflected as legacy services.\nDue to rapid changes in technology and the competitive environment, determining the estimated economic life of telecommunications plant and equipment requires a significant amount of judgment. We regularly review data on utilization of equipment, asset retirements and salvage values to determine adjustments to our depreciation rates. The effect of a hypothetical one year increase or decrease in the estimated remaining useful lives of our property, plant and equipment would have decreased depreciation expense by approximately $390 million annually or increased depreciation expense by approximately $550 million annually, respectively.\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets is the long-term rate of return we expect to earn on the plans' assets in the future, net of administrative expenses paid from plan assets. The rate of return is determined by the strategic allocation of plan assets and the long-term risk and return forecast for each asset class. The forecasts for each asset class are generated primarily from an analysis of the long-term expectations of various third party investment management organizations to which we then add a factor of 50 basis points to reflect the benefit we expect to result from our active management of the assets. The expected rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually and revised, as necessary, to reflect changes in the financial markets and our investment strategy.\nTo compute the expected return on pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets, we apply an expected rate of return to the fair value of the pension plan assets and to the fair value of the post-retirement benefit plan assets adjusted for contribution timing and for projected benefit payments to be made from the plan assets. Annual market volatility for these assets (higher or lower than expected return) is reflected in the net actuarial losses.\nPotential Impact of the Sale of Our Colocation Business and Data Centers\n\n (7) The table is limited solely to contractual payment obligations and does not include: \n\nWe are required to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate an impairment may have occurred. We are required to write-down the value of goodwill in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. Our reporting units are not discrete legal entities with discrete financial statements. Our assets and liabilities are employed in and relate to the operations of our reporting units. Therefore, the equity carrying value and future cash flows must be estimated each time a goodwill impairment analysis is performed on a reporting unit. As a result, our assets, liabilities and cash flows are assigned to reporting units using reasonable and consistent allocation methodologies. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions are required to perform these assignments. We believe these estimates, judgments and assumptions to be reasonable, but changes in many of these can significantly affect each reporting unit's equity carrying value and future cash flows utilized for our goodwill impairment test. Our annual assessment date for testing goodwill impairment is October 31.\n (4) We have various long-term, non-cancelable purchase commitments for advertising and promotion services, including advertising and marketing at sports arenas and other venues and events. We also have purchase commitments with third-party vendors for operating, installation and maintenance services for facilities. In addition, we have service-related commitments with various vendors for data processing, technical and software support services. Future payments under certain service contracts will vary depending on our actual usage. In the table above, we estimated payments for these service contracts based on estimates of the level of services we expect to receive. Includes $80 million of purchase commitments related to our colocation operations. See Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information regarding the purchase commitments related to our colocation operations. \n______________________________________________________________________ \nConsumer segment expenses increased by $68 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in our consumer segment expenses was primarily due to increases in costs related to Prism TV (resulting from higher content volume and rates), professional fees, sales commissions, bad debt expense and network costs, which were partially offset by reductions in salaries and wages from lower headcount and payment processing fees. Consumer segment expenses increased by $11 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily due to increases in Prism TV content costs (resulting from higher volume and rates) and bad debt expense, which were partially offset by reductions in employee-related costs, facility costs, fleet expenses and network expenses.\nBy operating internationally, we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the foreign currencies used by our international subsidiaries, primarily the British Pound, and secondarily the Canadian Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Hong Kong Dollar and the Singapore Dollar. Although the percentages of our consolidated revenues and costs that are denominated in these currencies are immaterial, future volatility in exchange rates and an increase in the number of transactions could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations. We use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to this foreign currency risk, measuring the change in financial position arising from a hypothetical 10% change in the exchange rates of these currencies, relative to the U.S. Dollar, with all other variables held constant. The aggregate potential change in the fair value of financial assets resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in these exchange rates was $18 million at December 31, 2016.\nIn 2015, we accepted CAF funding from the FCC of approximately $500 million per year for six years to fund the deployment of voice and broadband capable infrastructure for approximately 1.2 million rural households and businesses (living units) in 33 states under the CAF Phase 2 high-cost support program. This program provides a monthly high-cost subsidy similar to the support provided by the FCC's previous cost reimbursement programs. Although we believe that there is no specific authoritative U.S. GAAP guidance for the treatment of government assistance, we identified three acceptable methods to account for these funds: (1) recognize revenue when entitled to receive cash, (2) defer cash received until the living units are enabled to receive the service at the FCC specified level, or (3) record the cash received as contra capital. After assessing these alternatives, we have determined that we will recognize CAF Phase 2 funds each month as revenue when we are entitled to receive the cash less a deferred amount. The amount of revenue deferred in 2016 was approximately $12 million. We believe our recognition methodology is consistent with other companies in our industry in the United States, but may not necessarily be consistent with companies outside the United States that receive similar government funding, and we cannot provide assurances to this effect.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nThe following tables summarize the results of operations from our business segment: \nOther Matters\nFor information on our outstanding debt securities, see immediately below \"Future Contractual Obligations\" and Note 5-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.\nSegment Revenues\nFurther analysis of our segment operating revenues and trends impacting our performance are provided below in \"Segment Results.\"\nSegment Expenses\nThe discount rate for each plan is the rate at which we believe we could effectively settle the plan's benefit obligations as of the end of the year. We selected each plan's discount rate based on a cash flow matching analysis using hypothetical yield curves from U.S. corporate bonds rated high quality and projections of the future benefit payments that constitute the projected benefit obligation for the plans. This process establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year's benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. The spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 60th to 90th percentile of U.S. high quality bonds.\nOur pension plan contains provisions that allow us, from time to time, to offer lump sum payment options to certain former employees in settlement of their future retirement benefits. These lump sum payments are paid from the trust that holds the plan's assets. Under pension settlement accounting, we record an accounting settlement charge associated with these lump sum payments only if, in the aggregate, they exceed the sum of the annual service and interest costs for the plan's net periodic pension benefit cost. There were no pension lump sum offerings in 2016, other than those to eligible employees who terminated during 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we made cash settlement payments to former employees for lump sum offers of approximately $356 million, but pension settlement accounting was not triggered in 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we made cash settlement payments to former employees for lump sum offers of approximately $460 million, which triggered pension settlement accounting and resulted in us recording additional pension expense of $63 million. Pension expense is allocated to cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), selling, general and administrative and to capital projects. See Note 9-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, for additional information on the pension lump sum offers.\n\nSubstantially all of our post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits plans are unfunded. Several trusts hold assets that have been used to help cover the health care costs of certain retirees. Assets in the post-retirement trusts have been substantially depleted as of December 31, 2016; however, we will continue to pay certain benefits through the trusts. The fair value of these trust assets was approximately $53 million at December 31, 2016, with a portion comprised of investments with restricted liquidity. Benefits not paid through the trusts will be paid directly by us. As described further in Note 9-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, aggregate benefits paid by us under these plans (net of participant contributions and direct subsidy receipts) were $129 million, $116 million and $88 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, while the amounts paid from the trust were $145 million, $163 million and $219 million, respectively. For additional information on our expected future benefits payments for our post-retirement benefit plans, please see Note 9-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II in this annual report.\nOther Consolidated Results\nMarket Risk\nBased on information provided to us by Level 3, as of December 31, 2016, Level 3 had approximately $9.0 billion of NOL carryforwards that we expect to acquire in connection with the Level 3 transaction. We cannot assure you that we will be able to use these NOL carryforwards fully, or at all. See \"Risk Factors-Risk Relating to Our Pending Acquisition of Level 3-We cannot assure you, whether, when or in what amounts we will be able to use Level 3's net operating loss carryforwards following the Level 3 acquisition\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report.\nAs of the date of this annual report, the credit ratings for the senior unsecured debt of CenturyLink, Inc. and Qwest Corporation were as follows: \nOperating Revenues\n (3) During 2014, we recognized a $60 million tax benefit associated with a deduction for the tax basis for worthless stock in a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary and a $63 million pension settlement charge.  The following table summarizes our access lines, broadband subscribers, Prism TV subscribers, data centers and number of employees: \nNormal retirements of property, plant and equipment are charged against accumulated depreciation, with no gain or loss recognized. We depreciate such property on the straight-line method over estimated service lives ranging from 3 to 45 years.\n______________________________________________________________________ ", "item_7_text": "The results for our business and consumer segments are summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: \n \u2022 other long-term liabilities, such as accruals for legal matters and other taxes that are not contractual obligations by nature. We cannot determine with any degree of reliability the years in which these liabilities might ultimately settle; \nThe following table summarizes the results of our consolidated operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: \nIn 2013, under the CAF Phase 1 Round 2 program, we received $40 million in funding for deployment of broadband services in rural areas. In compliance with program terms, during the second half of 2016 we returned $23 million for failing to meet interim buildout milestones within the FCC specified time frames. As of December 31, 2016, we have included the remaining $17 million of funding in deferred credits and other liabilities - other on our consolidated balance sheet. At the conclusion of the CAF 1 Round 2 program in the first quarter 2017, we will have an opportunity to reclaim a majority of the interim refund if we ultimately meet the CAF 1 Round 2 buildout targets.\n \u2022 contingent liabilities; \nAll references to \"Notes\" in this Item 7 of Part II refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. Certain statements in this annual report constitute forward-looking statements. See \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Related Matters\" in Item 1 of Part I of this annual report for factors relating to these statements and \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects.\nThe following tables summarize our operating expenses: \nDuring the first half of 2016, we implemented several changes with respect to the assignment of certain expenses to our reportable segments, including changes that increased our consumer segment expenses and decreased our business segment expenses in prior periods. We have recast our previously reported segment results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 to conform to the current presentation. See Note 14-Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information on our changes in segment reporting.\nFollowing the announcement of our pending acquisition of Level 3, Standard & Poor's indicated that CenturyLink, Inc.'s current unsecured senior debt rating of BB has been placed on watch with negative implications, Moody's Investor Service, Inc. indicated that CenturyLink, Inc.'s current senior unsecured debt rating of Ba3 has been placed on review for downgrade and Fitch Ratings indicated that CenturyLink, Inc.'s current unsecured senior debt rating of BB+ has been placed on negative watch. Additionally, Qwest Corporation's current unsecured senior debt rating of Ba1 has been placed on review for downgrade by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and its current unsecured senior debt rating of BBB- has been placed on negative watch by Fitch Ratings. It is expected that any downgrades would be made only following the completion of the Level 3 acquisition.\n______________________________________________________________________\n \u2022 Data integration, which includes the sale of telecommunications equipment located on customers' premises and related products and professional services, such as network management, installation and maintenance of data equipment and the building of proprietary fiber-optic broadband networks for our governmental and business customers; and \nWorkforce Reductions\nMortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on historical demographic studies by the Society of Actuaries. In 2016, we adopted the revised mortality table and projection scale released by the Society of Actuaries (\"SOA\"), which decreased the projected benefit obligation of our benefit plans by $268 million. The 2015 revised mortality table and projection scale decreased the 2015 projected benefit obligation of our benefit plans by $379 million. In 2014, the SOA published new mortality rate tables reflecting increases in the projected life expectancies of North Americans since its publications of earlier tables. We adopted the new tables immediately. This resulted in an increase to the projected benefit obligation of approximately $1.3 billion for our pension and post-retirement benefit plans. The change in the projected benefit obligation of our benefit plans was recognized as part of the net actuarial loss and is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a portion of which is subject to amortization over the remaining estimated life of plan participants, which was approximately 9 to 10 years as of December 31, 2016.\nAmortization expense decreased by $128 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased by $117 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in amortization expense for both periods was primarily due to the use of accelerated amortization for a portion of our customer relationship assets and our entry into an agreement to sell our data centers and colocation business. The effect of using an accelerated amortization method results in an incremental decline in expense each period as the intangible assets amortize. We ceased amortizing the intangible assets of our colocation business when we entered into the agreement to sell that business. We estimate that we would have recorded additional amortization expense during 2016 of $6 million if we had not agreed to sell the colocation business. In addition, amortization of capitalized software was lower in both periods due to software becoming fully amortized faster than new software was acquired or developed.\nIn connection with recording deferred income tax assets and liabilities, we establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be realized. We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine whether adjustments to our valuation allowance are appropriate in light of changes in facts or circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. In making this evaluation, we rely on our recent history of pre-tax earnings. We also rely on our forecasts of future earnings and the nature and timing of future deductions and benefits represented by the deferred tax assets, all which involve the exercise of significant judgment. At December 31, 2016, we established a valuation allowance of $375 million primarily related to state NOLs, as it is more likely than not that these NOLs will expire unused. If forecasts of future earnings and the nature and estimated timing of future deductions and benefits change in the future, we may determine that a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets is appropriate, which could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. See Note 13-Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information.\nIn 2015, we accepted CAF funding from the FCC of approximately $500 million per year for six years to fund the deployment of voice and broadband capable infrastructure for approximately 1.2 million rural households and businesses in 33 states under the CAF Phase 2 high-cost support program. The funding from the CAF Phase 2 support program has substantially replaced the funding from the interstate USF program that we previously utilized to support voice services in high-cost rural markets in these 33 states. In late 2015, we began receiving these monthly support payments from the FCC under the new CAF Phase 2 support program, which included (i) monthly support payments at a higher rate than under the interstate USF support program and (ii) a substantial one-time transitional payment, designed to align the prior USF payments with the new CAF Phase 2 payments for the full year 2015. For 2016, we continued to receive monthly support payments at the higher rate than under the interstate USF support program. We received $214 million and $209 million more cash from the CAF Phase 2 program for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, than the projected amounts we would have otherwise received during the same periods under the interstate USF support program.\nPension Lump Sum Offer\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following tables summarize our total other expense, net and income tax expense: \nThe decline in legacy services revenues for both periods reflects the continuing loss of access lines, loss of long-distance revenues primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive products and services, including data and wireless communication services, and reductions in the volume of our private line (including special access) services. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 11.1 million access lines, or approximately 5.6% less than the number of access lines we operated at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 11.7 million access lines, or approximately 5.2% less than the number of access lines we operated at December 31, 2014. We estimate that the rate of our access lines losses will be between 4% and 6% over the full year of 2017.\nOther operating revenues decreased by $17 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in other operating revenues was primarily due to lower high-cost support revenues. These declines were partially offset by higher USF surcharge revenues related to increased universal service fund contribution factors. Other operating revenues increased by $229 million, or 23%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in other operating revenues was primarily due to additional revenue recorded under the CAF Phase 2 support program. For additional information about the CAF Phase 2 support program, see the discussion below in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Connect America Fund.\"\nFor additional information on our goodwill balances by segment, see Note 4-Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.\nOn August 22, 2016, Qwest Corporation issued $978 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% Notes due 2056, including $128 million principal amount that was sold pursuant to an over-allotment option, in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and other expenses, of $946 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $544 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a significant negative variance in net income adjusted for non-cash items (attributable to higher cash taxes paid and lower profitability), which was partially offset by a positive variance in the change in accounts payable. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a slight negative variance in net income adjusted for non-cash items along with negative variances in accounts payable and other noncurrent assets and liabilities, net. The decreases were substantially offset with positive variances in accrued income and other taxes and other current assets and liabilities, net, which was primarily due to a payment of approximately $235 million in 2014 to settle certain litigation. Our net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 and 2015 were positively impacted by the cash received from the CAF Phase 2 support program, which was $214 million and $209 million greater in 2016 and 2015, respectively, than the projected amounts of cash we would have otherwise received during the same periods under the interstate USF support program. For additional information about our operating results, see \"Results of Operations\" above.\n \u2022 market our products and services to new customers. \nCost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) decreased by $4 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was primarily due to reductions in salaries and wages from lower headcount, professional fees, payment processing fees and customer premises equipment costs, which were substantially offset by increases in content costs for Prism TV (resulting from higher content volume and rates), network expense and USF rates. Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) decreased by $68 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding the lower customer premises equipment costs, cost of services and products increased by $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in costs of services and products was primarily due to increases in pension and postretirement costs, USF rate increases, higher network expenses and increases in content costs for Prism TV. These increases were partially offset by decreases in salaries and wages from lower headcount, professional fees and contract labor costs.\n \u2022 potential indemnification obligations to counterparties in certain agreements entered into in the normal course of business. The nature and terms of these arrangements vary.  For information on debt that we expect to assume or incur in connection with consummating the Level 3 acquisition, see \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report and Note 5-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.\nProperty, plant and equipment acquired in connection with our acquisitions was recorded based on its estimated fair value as of its acquisition date, plus the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually required asset retirement obligation. Purchased and constructed property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, plus the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually required asset retirement obligation. Renewals and betterments of plant and equipment are capitalized while repairs, as well as renewals of minor items, are charged to operating expense. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on the straight-line method using class or overall group rates. The group method provides for the recognition of the remaining net investment, less anticipated net salvage value, over the remaining useful life of the assets. This method requires the periodic revision of depreciation rates.\nBusiness segment income decreased by $257 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased by $332 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in business segment income for both periods was due predominantly to the loss of customers and lower service volumes in our legacy services.\n (6) Represents the amount of tax and interest we would pay for our unrecognized tax benefits. The $51 million is composed of unrecognized tax benefits of $16 million and related estimated interest of $35 million, which would result in future cash payments if our tax positions were not upheld. See Note 13-Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information. The timing of any payments for our unrecognized tax benefits cannot be predicted with certainty; therefore, such amount is reflected in the \"2022 and thereafter\" column in the above table. \nThe following tables summarize our consolidated operating revenues recorded under our four revenue categories: \nThe following tables summarize our consolidated cash flow activities: \nOverview\nOur capital expenditures continue to be focused on our strategic services. For more information on our capital spending, see \"Business\" and \"Risk Factors\" in Items 1 and 1A, respectively, of Part I of this annual report.\nSegment Income\nSegment Revenues\nIf, as anticipated, we sell our colocation business and data centers in the manner discussed in Note 3-Pending Sale of Colocation Business and Data Centers to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, we expect to receive net cash proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion from the sale, which is net of tax payments relating to the sale of approximately $100 million to $200 million, which we anticipate will be triggered by certain corporate restructuring actions we are taking in the first quarter of 2017 regarding certain subsidiaries involved in the colocation business. We also expect ongoing cash flows from operating activities will be negatively impacted by approximately $30 million to $45 million per quarter.\nOn June 1, 2016, Embarq Corporation paid at maturity the $1.184 billion principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest due under its 7.082% Notes.\nChanges in Segment Reporting\nPension and Post-retirement Benefits\nThe following tables provide detail of our depreciation and amortization expense: \nThe following table reconciles our total segment revenues and total segment income presented above to consolidated operating revenues and consolidated operating income reported in our consolidated statements of operations. \nOn September 15, 2016, Qwest Corporation redeemed $287 million of its 7.5% Notes due 2051, which resulted in a loss of $9 million.\n\nData integration revenues, which are typically more volatile than our other sources of revenues, decreased by $44 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decline in data integration revenues was primarily due to declines in governmental and business sales and professional and maintenance services. Data integration revenues decreased by $115 million, or 17%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decline in data integration revenues was primarily due to declines in governmental sales and professional services, which were partially offset by an increase in maintenance services.\nGoodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets\n (2) We define a data center as any facility where we market, sell and deliver either colocation services, multi-tenant managed services, or both. Our data centers are located in North America, Europe and Asia. \nFor unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information relating to the acquisition, see the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC by us on February 13, 2017. This pro forma financial information is based upon preliminary purchase price allocations and various assumptions and estimates, all of which we urge you to carefully consider in connection with your review of such information.\nConsumer segment income decreased by $187 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to loss of customers from legacy services and increases in the costs related to the growth in Prism TV. Consumer segment income increased by $13 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily due to price increases on various services.\n \u2022 our open purchase orders as of December 31, 2016. These purchase orders are generally issued at fair value, and are generally cancelable without penalty; \n \u2022 cash funding requirements for qualified pension benefits payable to certain eligible current and future retirees. Benefits paid by our qualified pension plan are paid through a trust. Cash funding requirements for this trust are not included in this table as we are not able to reliably estimate required contributions to this trust. Our funding projections are discussed further below; \nOur total operating revenues decreased by $430 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased by $131 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decline in operating revenues for both periods was primarily due to lower legacy services revenues, which decreased by $666 million, or 8%, and $695 million, or 8%, for the respective periods.\n (3) Includes $750 million of operating lease future rental commitments related to our colocation operations. See Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information regarding the future commitments for operating leases related to our colocation operations. \nWe are involved in several material legal proceedings, as described in more detail in Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. We assess potential losses in relation to these and other pending or threatened tax and legal matters. For matters not related to income taxes, if a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we recognize an expense for the estimated loss. To the extent these estimates are more or less than the actual liability resulting from the resolution of these matters, our earnings will be increased or decreased accordingly. If the differences are material, our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted.\nIn 2016, we changed the method we use to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit expense for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. This change resulted in a decrease in the service and interest components in 2016. Beginning in 2016, we utilized a full yield curve approach in connection with estimating these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows, as opposed to the single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve that we have used in the past. We believe this change more precisely measures service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change did not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations but lowered our annual net periodic benefit cost by approximately $149 million in 2016. This change was treated as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, we did not adjust the amounts recorded in 2015 or 2014.\nInterest expense increased by $6 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest expense was substantially due to a reduction in the amount of net premium amortization recorded at acquisition due to the early retirement of several issuances of debt during the period, which has the effect of increasing interest expense and an increase in interest expense on unsecured notes related to the issuance of $1.0 billion of new debt in April, 2016 in advance of a debt maturity in June, 2016. Interest expense increased by $1 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to a reduction in the amortization of debt premiums, which was substantially offset by higher capitalized interest, lower bond coupon rates and lower interest under our Credit Facility. See Note 5-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report and Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information about our debt.\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of exposures to market risks. Actual values may differ materially from those disclosed by us from time to time if market conditions vary from the assumptions used in the analyses performed. These analyses only incorporate the risk exposures that existed at December 31, 2016.\nThe measurement of deferred taxes often involves the exercise of considerable judgment related to the realization of tax basis. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment that tax positions taken in filed tax returns and the resulting tax basis are more likely than not to be sustained if they are audited by taxing authorities. Assessing tax rates that we expect to apply and determining the years when the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income requires judgment about the future apportionment of our income among the states in which we operate. Any changes in our practices or judgments involved in the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nUpon being completed, this transaction will result in the Purchaser acquiring 57 data centers. This business generated revenues of $622 million, $626 million and $643 million (excluding revenue with affiliates) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively (a small portion of which will be retained by us). Based on certain estimates and assumptions regarding the closing date and various tax matters, we currently project that the net cash proceeds from the divestiture will be approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. We plan to use a portion of these net cash proceeds to partly fund our acquisition of Level 3.\nWe have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support and we do not engage in leasing, hedging or other similar activities that expose us to any significant liabilities that are not (i) reflected on the face of the consolidated financial statements, (ii) disclosed in Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, or in the Future Contractual Obligations table included in this Item 7 of Part II above, or (iii) discussed under the heading \"Market Risk\" above.\nIn 2014, approximately 16% of the qualified pension plans' January 1, 2014 net actuarial loss balance of $1.048 billion was subject to amortization as a component of net periodic expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits, which ranges from 8 to 9 years for the plans. The other 84% of the pension plans' beginning net actuarial loss balance was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2014. The entire beginning net actuarial loss of $37 million for the post-retirement benefit plans was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2014.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIncome tax expense decreased by $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Our income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $100 million from the amounts for the comparable prior year. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our effective income tax rate was 38.6%, 33.3% and 30.5%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflects a tax impact of $18 million from an intercompany dividend payment from one of our foreign subsidiaries to its domestic parent company that was made as part of our corporate restructuring in preparation for the sale of our colocation business. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects a tax benefit of approximately $34 million related to affiliate debt rationalization, research and development tax credits of $28 million for 2011 through 2015, and a $16 million tax decrease due to changes in state taxes caused by apportionment changes, state tax rate changes and the changes in the expected utilization of net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\"). The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects a $60 million tax benefit associated with a worthless stock deduction for the tax basis in a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary as a result of developments in bankruptcy proceedings involving its sole asset, an indirect investment in KPNQwest, N.V. The subsidiary was acquired as part of the acquisition of Qwest and we assigned it no fair value in the acquisition due to the bankruptcy proceedings, which were then ongoing. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 also reflects a $13 million tax decrease due to changes in state taxes caused by apportionment changes, state tax rate changes and the changes in the expected utilization of NOLs. The rate also reflects the absence of tax benefits from the impairment and disposition of our 700 MHz A-Block wireless spectrum licenses in 2014, because we are not likely to generate income of a character required to realize a tax benefit from the loss on disposition during the period permitted by law for utilization of that loss. See Note 13-Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report and \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Income Taxes\" below for additional information.\nBased on our current capital allocation objectives, during 2017 we anticipate expending approximately $2.6 billion of cash for capital investment in property, plant and equipment and up to $1.176 billion for dividends on our common stock, based on the current annual common stock dividend rate of $2.16 and the current number of outstanding common shares, assuming solely for these purposes no impact from the Level 3 acquisition. During 2017, we have debt maturities of $1.421 billion, scheduled debt principal payments of $22 million and capital lease and other fixed payments of approximately $100 million (including $41 million of capital lease obligations related to the colocation operations), excluding liabilities that we expect to assume later in 2017 in connection with consummating the Level 3 acquisition. Each of the expenditures are described further below.\nCost of Services and Products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nIn 2016, approximately 53% of the qualified pension plan's January 1, 2016 net actuarial loss balance of $2.843 billion was subject to amortization as a component of net periodic expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits, which ranges from 9 to 10 years for the plan. The other 47% of the qualified pension plan's beginning net actuarial loss balance was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2016. The entire beginning net actuarial loss of $147 million for the post-retirement benefit plans was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2016.\nDividends\nHistorical Information\nFinancing Activities\n \u2022 Operating efficiencies. We continue to evaluate our segment operating structure and focus. This involves balancing our workforce in response to our workload requirements, productivity improvements and changes in industry, competitive, technological and regulatory conditions. We also expect our consumer segment to benefit indirectly from enhanced efficiencies in our company-wide network operations.  The following tables summarize the results of operations from our consumer segment: \n \u2022 Consumer Segment. Consists generally of providing strategic and legacy products and services to residential customers. Our strategic products and services offered to these customers include our broadband, video (including our Prism TV services) and other ancillary services. Our legacy services offered to these customers include local and long-distance voice and other ancillary services. \nThe following table summarizes our estimated future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016: \nNet Operating Loss Carryforwards\nOther income, net reflects certain items not directly related to our core operations, including our share of income from partnerships we do not control, interest income, gains and losses from non-operating asset dispositions and foreign currency gains and losses. Other income, net decreased by $16 million, or 70%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in other income, net was primarily due to losses on early retirement of debt, which was partially offset by the impact of nonrecurring funding from a state economic development program. Other income, net increased by $12 million, or 109%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase in other income, net was primarily due to the impact of a 2014 impairment charge of $14 million recorded in connection with the sale of our 700 MHz A-Block Wireless Spectrum licenses, which was partially offset by a net loss on early retirement of debt in 2015.\nLoss Contingencies and Litigation Reserves\nBenefits paid by our qualified pension plan are paid through a trust that holds all of the plan's assets. Based on current laws and circumstances, we do not expect any contributions to be required for our qualified pension plan during 2017. The amount of required contributions to our qualified pension plan in 2018 and beyond will depend on a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control, including earnings on plan investments, prevailing interest rates, demographic experience, changes in plan benefits and changes in funding laws and regulations. We occasionally make voluntary contributions to the trust in addition to required contributions, including voluntary contributions in the amount of $100 million made in the third quarter of both 2016 and 2015. We currently expect to make a voluntary contribution of $100 million to the trust in 2017.\nCredit Facility\n______________________________________________________________________ \n \u2022 Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are expenses incurred in providing products and services to our customers. These expenses include: employee-related expenses directly attributable to operating and maintaining our network (such as salaries, wages, benefits and professional fees); facilities expenses (which include third-party telecommunications expenses we incur for using other carriers' networks to provide services to our customers); rents and utilities expenses; equipment sales expenses (such as data integration and modem expenses); payments to universal service funds (which are federal and state funds that are established to promote the availability of telecommunications services to all consumers at reasonable and affordable rates, among other things, and to which we are often required to contribute); certain litigation expenses associated with our operations; and other expenses directly related to our operations; and \nConsumer Segment\nDuring the last decade, we have experienced revenue declines primarily due to declines in access lines, private line customers, switched access rates and minutes of use. To mitigate these revenue declines, we remain focused on efforts to, among other things:\nPension and Post-retirement Benefit Obligations\n\nIncome Taxes\n \u2022 Legacy services. Our voice revenues have been, and we expect they will continue to be, adversely affected by access line losses and lower long-distance voice service volumes. Intense competition and product substitution continue to drive our access line losses. For example, many consumers are substituting cable and wireless voice services and electronic mail, texting and social networking non-voice services for traditional voice telecommunications services. We expect that these factors will continue to negatively impact our business. As a result of the expected loss of higher margin services associated with access lines, we continue to offer our customers service bundling and other product promotions to help mitigate this trend, as described below. Customer migration and price compression from competitive pressures have not only negatively impacted our legacy revenues, but they have also negatively impacted the operating margins of our legacy services and we expect this trend to continue. Operating costs, such as installation costs and facility costs, have also negatively impacted the operating margins of our legacy services, but to a lesser extent than customer migration and price compression. Operating costs also tend to impact our legacy services margins to a lesser extent than our strategic services as noted above; \nWe are required to reassign goodwill to reporting units each time we reorganize our internal reporting structure which causes a change in the composition of our reporting units. We assign goodwill to the reporting units using a relative fair value approach. We utilize the trailing twelve months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as our allocation methodology as we believe that it represents a reasonable proxy for the fair value of the operations being reorganized. The use of other fair value assignment methods could result in materially different results. For additional information on our segments, see Note 14-Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.\n (1) We define a data center as any facility where we market, sell and deliver either colocation services, multi-tenant managed services, or both. Our data centers are located in North America, Europe and Asia.  See Note 3-Pending Sale of Colocation Business and Data Centers to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information on the pending sale.\n______________________________________________________________________ \nAt December 31, 2016, CenturyLink, Inc. owed $336 million under a term loan maturing in 2019 and Qwest Corporation owed $100 million under a term loan maturing in 2025. Both of these term loans include covenants substantially similar to those set forth in the Credit Facility.\nIn February 2015, the FCC adopted new regulations that regulate broadband services as a public utility service under Title II of the Communications Act. In light of pending litigation and changes in the composition of the FCC, we believe it is premature for us to determine the ultimate impact of the new regulations on our operations. For additional information, see Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters\u201d in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report.\nLevel 3 Financing Commitment Letter\n \u2022 Strategic services. In order to remain competitive and attract additional residential broadband subscribers, we believe it is important to continually increase our broadband network's scope and connection speeds. As a result, we continue to invest in our broadband network, which allows for the delivery of higher-speed broadband services to a greater number of customers. We compete in a maturing broadband market in which most consumers already have broadband services and growth rates in new subscribers have slowed. Moreover, as described further in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report, certain of our competitors continue to provide broadband services at higher average transmission speeds than ours or through advanced wireless data service offerings, both of which we believe have impacted the competitiveness of certain of our broadband offerings. The offering of our facilities-based video services in our markets requires us to incur substantial start-up expenses in advance of marketing and selling the service. Also, our associated content costs continue to increase and the video business has become more competitive as more options become available to customers to access video services through new technologies. The demand for new technology has increased the number of competitors offering strategic services similar to ours. Price compression and new technology from our competitors have negatively impacted the operating margins of our strategic services and we expect this trend to continue. Operating costs also impact the operating margins of our strategic services. These operating costs include employee costs, marketing and advertising expenses, sales commissions, Prism TV content costs and installation costs. We believe increases in operating costs have generally had a greater impact on our operating margins of our strategic services as compared to our legacy services, principally because our strategic services rely more heavily upon the above-listed costs; \nIn connection with entering into our merger agreement with Level 3, we obtained a debt commitment letter from a group of lenders. See Note 5-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, for additional information on the financing commitment letter.\nFuture Contractual Obligations\nPending Sale of Colocation Business and Data Centers\nSegment Expenses\nSee Note 5-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, for additional information on our outstanding debt securities.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nWe currently categorize our products, services and revenues among the following four categories:\nPotential Impact of the Pending Acquisition of Level 3\nThe operations of our consumer segment have been impacted by several significant trends, including those described below:\n (2) Actual principal and interest paid in all years may differ due to future refinancing of outstanding debt or issuance of new debt. Interest on our floating rate debt was calculated for all years using the rates effective at December 31, 2016. Also, includes interest and executory costs of $93 million associated with our capital lease obligations related to our colocation operations. See Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information regarding the future commitments for capital leases related to our colocation operations. \n\nFor matters related to income taxes, if we determine in our judgment that the impact of an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority, then we recognize in our financial statements a benefit for the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if we determine in our judgment that the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Though the validity of any tax position is a matter of tax law, the body of statutory, regulatory and interpretive guidance on the application of the law is complex and often ambiguous. Because of this, whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $141 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 substantially due to an increase in payments for property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $224 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a decrease in payments of property, plant and equipment and amounts paid for acquisitions in 2015.\n \u2022 Legacy services. We continue to experience customers migrating away from our higher margin legacy services into lower margin strategic services. Our legacy services revenues have been, and we expect they will continue to be, adversely affected by access line losses and price compression. In particular, our access, local services and long-distance revenues have been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by customer migration to more technologically advanced services, an increase in the use of non-voice communications and a related decrease in the demand for traditional voice services, industry consolidation and price compression caused by regulation and rate reductions. For example, many of our business segment customers are substituting cable, wireless and VoIP services for traditional voice telecommunications services, resulting in continued access revenue loss. Demand for our private line services (including special access) continues to decline due to our customers' optimization of their networks, industry consolidation and technological migration to higher-speed services. Although our legacy services generally face fewer direct competitors than certain of our strategic services, customer migration and, to a lesser degree, price compression from competitive pressures have negatively impacted our legacy revenues and the operating margins of our legacy services. We expect this trend to continue. Operating costs, such as installation costs and third-party facility costs, have also negatively impacted the operating margins of our legacy services, but to a lesser extent than customer loss, customer migration and price compression. Operating costs also tend to impact our legacy services to a lesser extent than our strategic services as noted above; \nCompletion of the transaction is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, as well as approvals from the Federal Communications Commission (the \"FCC\") and certain state regulatory authorities. The transaction is also subject to the approval of CenturyLink and Level 3 shareholders at meetings scheduled to be held on March 16, 2017, as well as other customary closing conditions. Subject to these conditions, we anticipate closing this transaction by the end of the third quarter 2017. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay Level 3 a termination fee of $472 million, or Level 3 may be obligated to pay CenturyLink a termination fee of $738 million.\nWe have a $160 million uncommitted revolving letter of credit facility which enables us to provide letters of credit under terms that may be more favorable than those under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2016, our outstanding letters of credit totaled $105 million under this facility.\nManagement periodically reviews our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and periodically implements strategies to manage the exposure. From time to time, we have used derivative instruments to (i) lock-in or swap our exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2016, we had no such instruments outstanding. We have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n \u2022 increase the capacity, speed and usage of our networks; and \nAs of October 31, 2016, we assessed goodwill for impairment for our three reporting units, which we determined to be business (excluding wholesale), consumer and wholesale and determined that the estimated fair value of our wholesale reporting unit was substantially in excess of our carrying value of equity and the estimated fair value of our business and consumer reporting units exceeded our carrying value of equity by 28% and 18%, respectively.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn computing our pension and post-retirement health care and life insurance benefit obligations, our most significant assumptions are the discount rate and mortality rates. In computing our periodic pension and post-retirement benefit expense, our most significant assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets.\n \u2022 Data integration. We expect both data integration revenue and the related costs will fluctuate from year to year as this offering tends to be more sensitive than others to changes in the economy and in spending trends of our federal, state and local governmental customers, many of whom have experienced substantial budget cuts over the past several years, with the possibility of additional future budget cuts. Our data integration operating margins are typically smaller than most of our other offerings; and \nTerm Loans and Revolving Letter of Credit\n \u2022 promote long-term relationships with our customers through bundling of integrated services; \nOther Income, Net\nAllocation of Revenues and Expenses\n \u2022 certain post-retirement benefits payable to certain eligible current and future retirees. Not all of our post-retirement benefit obligation amount is a contractual obligation and only the portion that we believe is a contractual obligation is reported in the table. See additional information on our benefits plans in Note 9-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report; \nOperating Activities\nBusiness segment revenues decreased by $294 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in business segment revenues was primarily due to declines in our legacy services revenues. The decline in legacy services revenues was attributable to a reduction in local service access lines and lower volumes of long-distance and access services for the reasons noted above and to reductions in the volume of private line (including special access) services. The increase in our strategic services revenues was primarily due to increases in MPLS unit growth and higher Ethernet and VOIP volumes, which were partially offset by declines in our hosting services. The decrease in our data integration revenues was primarily due to lower sales of customer premises equipment to governmental and business customers and to declines in maintenance services. Business segment revenues decreased by $384 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in business segment revenues was primarily due to declines in legacy services revenues and data integration revenues, which were partially offset by the growth in our strategic services revenues. The decline in legacy services revenues was attributable to a reduction in local service access lines and lower volumes of long-distance, access and traditional WAN services for the reasons noted above and a reduction in private line (including special access) volumes, as well as a pricing reduction on private line services for a large wholesale customer in exchange for a longer term commitment. The growth in our strategic services revenues was primarily due to MPLS unit growth and higher Ethernet volumes, which were partially offset by a reduction in hosting services. The decrease in data integration revenues was primarily due to lower sales of customer premises equipment to governmental and business customers during the period.\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate long-term debt obligations and fluctuations in certain foreign currencies. We seek to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nConnect America Fund\n \u2022 Business Segment. Consists generally of providing strategic, legacy and data integration products and services to small, medium and enterprise business, wholesale and governmental customers, including other communication providers. Our strategic products and services offered to these customers include our MPLS, Ethernet, colocation, hosting (including cloud hosting and managed hosting), broadband, VoIP, information technology and other ancillary services. Our legacy services offered to these customers primarily include local and long-distance voice, including the sale of unbundled network elements (\"UNEs\"), private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services. Our data integration offerings include the sale of telecommunications equipment located on customers' premises and related products and professional services, all of which are described further below under the heading \"Operating Revenues\"; and \n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Access lines are lines reaching from the customers' premises to a connection with the public network and broadband subscribers are customers that purchase broadband connection service through their existing telephone lines, stand-alone telephone lines, or fiber-optic cables. Our methodology for counting our access lines and broadband subscribers includes only those lines that we use to provide services to external customers and excludes lines used solely by us and our affiliates. It also excludes unbundled loops and includes stand-alone broadband subscribers. We count lines when we install the service. \nOur goodwill was derived from numerous acquisitions where the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired.\nOn September 19, 2016, a subsidiary of Embarq Corporation redeemed all of its 8.77% Notes due 2017, which was less than $4 million and resulted in an immaterial loss.\nSubject to market conditions, we expect to continue to issue debt securities from time to time in the future to refinance a substantial portion of our maturing debt, including issuing Qwest Corporation debt securities to refinance its maturing debt to the extent feasible. The availability, interest rate and other terms of any new borrowings will depend on the ratings assigned to us and Qwest Corporation by credit rating agencies, among other factors. For further information on our debt maturities, see \"Future Contractual Obligations\" below.\nInvesting Activities\nWe sponsor a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (referred to as our qualified pension plan) for a substantial portion of our employees. In addition to this tax-qualified pension plan, we also maintain several non-qualified pension plans for certain eligible highly compensated employees. We also maintain post-retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retirees.\n______________________________________________________________________\nIn computing the amount of revenue to recognize, we assume that we will not be able to economically enable 100% of the required living units in every state with voice and broadband capabilities under the CAF Phase 2 program. We defer recognition of the funds related to potential living units that we estimate we will not enable until we can with reasonable assurance determine that we can fully meet the enablement targets. As disclosed elsewhere herein, in some limited instances, a portion of the funds must be returned if enablement targets are not attained. Based on estimated enablement, the effect of a hypothetical 1% decrease in our estimate of living units we will not enable with voice and broadband capabilities under the CAF Phase 2 program would have increased our revenue by $3 million in 2016 and a 1% increase would have decreased our revenue by $9 million in 2016.\nOverview\nAt December 31, 2016, we held cash and cash equivalents of $222 million and we had $1.630 billion of borrowing capacity available under our $2 billion amended and restated revolving credit facility (referred to as our \"Credit Facility\", which is described further below). At December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents of $44 million were held in foreign bank accounts for the purpose of funding our foreign operations. Due to various factors, our access to foreign cash is generally much more restricted than our access to domestic cash.\nAs a result of accepting CAF Phase 2 support payments for 33 states, we will be obligated to make substantial capital expenditures to build broadband infrastructure over the next several years. See \"Capital Expenditures\" above.\nBusiness segment expenses decreased by $37 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in our business segment expenses was primarily due to decreases in salaries and wages, professional fees and payment processing fees, which were partially offset by increases in facility costs, network expense and real estate and power costs. Business segment expenses decreased by $52 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower customer premises equipment costs resulting from the lower sales noted above in segment revenues. Excluding the lower customer premises equipment costs, business expenses increased by $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due to increases in salaries and wages, benefits expense, external commissions, network expense and facility costs, which were partially offset by decreases in professional fees, materials and supplies and fleet expenses.\nResults of Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn recent years, we have been using Net Operating Loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards to offset a large portion of our federal taxable income. As of December 31, 2016, we have substantially utilized our federal NOL carryforwards. A portion of these remaining NOL carryforwards are subject to the limitations imposed by section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\"Code\"). As a result of the substantial utilization of the NOL carryforwards in prior years and the limitations imposed on portions of the remaining NOL carryforward balance, the amounts of our cash flows dedicated to or required for the payment of federal taxes has increased and is expected to continue to increase substantially during 2017 prior to our anticipated acquisition of additional NOLs later this year, as described further below. The amounts of our near-term tax payments will depend upon many factors, including our future earnings and tax circumstances. Based on current laws (including the extension of bonus depreciation) and our current estimates of 2017 earnings, we estimate our cash income tax liability related to 2017 will be between $500 million to $600 million, exclusive of (i) tax payments relating to the sale of our data centers and colocation business of approximately $100 million to $200 million, which we anticipate will be triggered by certain corporate restructuring actions we are taking in the first quarter of 2017 regarding certain subsidiaries involved in the colocation business and (ii) the impact of acquiring Level 3.\nWe are aggressively marketing our strategic services in an effort to partially offset the continuing declines in our legacy services.\n \u2022 Other operating revenues, which consists primarily of Connect America Fund (\"CAF\") support payments, Universal Service Fund (\"USF\") support payments and USF surcharges. We receive federal support payments from both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the CAF program, and support payments from both federal and state USF programs. These support payments are government subsidies designed to reimburse us for various costs related to certain telecommunications services, including the costs of deploying, maintaining and operating voice and broadband infrastructure in high-cost rural areas where we are not able to fully recover our costs from our customers. We also collect USF surcharges based on specific items we list on our customers' invoices to fund the FCC's universal service programs. We also generate other operating revenues from the leasing and subleasing of space in our office buildings, warehouses and other properties. Because we centrally manage the activities that generate these other operating revenues, these revenues are not included in our segment revenues. \nThe operations of our business segment have been impacted by several significant trends, including those described below:\n (2) During 2016, we recognized $189 million of severance expenses and other one-time termination benefits associated with our workforce reductions and $52 million of expenses related to our pending acquisition of Level 3. \nUpon completion of the acquisition, Level 3's assets and liabilities will be revalued and recorded at fair value. The assignment of fair value will require a significant amount of judgment. The use of fair value measures will affect the comparability of our post-acquisition financial information and may make it more difficult to predict earnings in future periods. For example, Level 3 has certain deferred costs and deferred revenues on its balance sheet associated with capacity leases. Based on the accounting guidance for business combinations, these existing deferred costs and deferred revenues are expected to be assigned little or no value in the purchase price allocation process and will thus be eliminated.\nChanges in any of the above factors could significantly impact operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive (loss) income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as well as the value of the liability and accumulated other comprehensive loss of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheets. The expected return on plan assets is reflected as a reduction to our pension and post-retirement benefit expense. If our assumed expected rates of return for 2016 were 100 basis points lower, our qualified pension and post-retirement benefit expenses for 2016 would have increased by $92 million. If our assumed discount rates for 2016 were 100 basis points lower, our qualified pension and post-retirement benefit expenses for 2016 would have increased by $46 million and our projected benefit obligation for 2016 would have increased by approximately $1.753 billion.\n \u2022 contract termination fees. These fees are non-recurring payments, the timing and payment of which, if any, is uncertain. In the ordinary course of business and to optimize our cost structure, we enter into contracts with terms greater than one year to use the network facilities of other carriers and to purchase other goods and services. Our contracts to use other carriers' network facilities generally have no minimum volume requirements and pricing is based upon volumes and usage. Assuming we terminate these contracts in 2017, the contract termination fees would be $359 million. Under the same assumption, we estimate that our termination fees for these contracts to purchase goods and services would be $165 million. In the normal course of business, we do not believe payment of these fees is likely; \nOur current definitions of operating expenses are as follows:\n \u2022 service level commitments to our customers, the violation of which typically results in service credits rather than cash payments; and \nUnder the Credit Facility, we, and our indirect subsidiary, Qwest Corporation, must maintain a debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined in our Credit Facility) ratio of not more than 4.0:1.0 and 2.85:1.0, respectively, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter for the four quarters then ended. The Credit Facility also contains a negative pledge covenant, which generally requires us to secure equally and ratably any advances under the Credit Facility if we pledge assets or permit liens on our property for the benefit of other debtholders. The Credit Facility also has a cross payment default provision, and the Credit Facility and certain of our debt securities also have cross acceleration provisions. When present, these provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. Our debt to EBITDA ratios could be adversely affected by a wide variety of events, including unforeseen expenses or contingencies. This could reduce our financing flexibility due to potential restrictions on incurring additional debt under certain provisions of our debt agreements or, in certain circumstances, could result in a default under certain provisions of such agreements.\nOur $2 billion Credit Facility matures on December 3, 2019 and has 16 lenders, each with commitments ranging from $3.5 million to $198.5 million. The Credit Facility allows us to obtain revolving loans and to issue up to $400 million of letters of credit, which upon issuance reduces the amount available for other extensions of credit. Interest is assessed on borrowings using either the LIBOR or the base rate (each as defined in the Credit Facility) plus an applicable margin between 1.00% and 2.25% per annum for LIBOR loans and 0.00% and 1.25% per annum for base rate loans depending on our then current senior unsecured long-term debt rating. Our obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by nine of our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2016, we had $370 million in borrowings and no amounts of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility.\nOperating Expenses\nOn October 31, 2016, we entered into a definitive merger agreement under which we propose to acquire Level 3 Communications, Inc. ( Level 3\u201d) in a cash and stock transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, Level 3 shareholders will receive $26.50 per share in cash and 1.4286 of CenturyLink shares for each share of Level 3 common stock they own at closing. CenturyLink shareholders are expected to own approximately 51% and Level 3 shareholders are expected to own approximately 49% of the combined company at closing. On December 31, 2016, Level 3 had outstanding $10.9 billion of long-term debt.\n \u2022 Service bundling and product promotions. We offer our customers the ability to bundle multiple products and services. These customers can bundle broadband services with other services such as local voice, video, long-distance and wireless. While we believe our bundled service offerings can help retain customers, they also tend to lower our profit margins in the consumer segment due to the related discounts; and \n \u2022 Operating efficiencies. We continue to evaluate our segment operating structure and focus. This involves balancing our workforce in response to our workload requirements, productivity improvements and changes in industry, competitive, technological and regulatory conditions, while achieving operational efficiencies and improving our processes through automation. However, our ongoing efforts to increase revenue will continue to require that we incur higher costs in some areas. We also expect our business segment to benefit indirectly from enhanced efficiencies in our company-wide network operations. \nAnnual depreciation expense is impacted by several factors, including changes in our depreciable cost basis, changes in our estimates of the remaining economic life of certain network assets, the addition of new plant and our entry into an agreement to sell our data centers and colocation business. Depreciation expense decreased by $145 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and decreased by $122 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The depreciation expense related to our plant was lower for both periods due to full depreciation and retirement of certain plant placed in service prior to 2016 and 2015. Additionally, we ceased depreciating property, plant and equipment assets of our colocation business when we entered into the agreement to sell that business. We estimate that we would have recorded additional depreciation expense during 2016 of $30 million if we had not agreed to sell the colocation business. The decrease in both periods was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense attributable to new plant placed in service during the respective years.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately $19.6 billion (excluding capital lease and other obligations with a carrying amount of $440 million) of long-term debt outstanding, approximately 96% of which bears interest at fixed rates and is therefore not exposed to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2016, we had $806 million floating rate debt exposed to changes in either the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the Prime Rate. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in LIBOR relative to this debt would decrease our annual pre-tax earnings by $8 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased by $783 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to a reduction of common stock repurchases. Net cash used in financing activities increased by $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to additional common stock repurchases. Net debt repayments have been about the same for all three years.\nFor additional information about the CAF Phase 2 support program, see the discussion below in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Connect America Fund.\"\nFor 2017, our estimated annual long-term rates of return are 6.5% and 5.0% for the pension plan trust assets and post-retirement plans' trust assets, respectively, based on the assets currently held. However, actual returns could be substantially different.\n \u2022 Legacy services, which include primarily local and long-distance voice services, including the sale of UNEs, private line (including special access), Integrated Services Digital Network (\"ISDN\") (which use regular telephone lines to support voice, video and data applications), switched access and other ancillary services; \n (1) On March 15, 2016, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. downgraded CenturyLink, Inc.'s rating from Ba2 to Ba3 and downgraded Qwest Corporation's rating from Baa3 to Ba1.  Our credit ratings are reviewed and adjusted from time to time by the rating agencies, and downgrades of CenturyLink, Inc.'s senior unsecured debt ratings could, under certain circumstances, incrementally increase the cost of our borrowing under the Credit Facility. Moreover, any additional downgrades of CenturyLink, Inc.'s or Qwest Corporation's senior unsecured debt ratings could impact our access to debt capital or further raise our borrowing costs. See \"Risk Factors-Risks Affecting our Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had recognized $52 million of expenses associated with our activities related to the pending Level 3 acquisition. We have not recognized certain other expenses that are contingent on completion of the acquisition. These expenses include financial advisory fees and compensation expense comprised of retention bonuses, severance and stock-based compensation for stock-based awards that will vest in connection with the acquisition. Most of these contingent expenses will be recognized in our consolidated financial statements in the period in which the acquisition occurs, with the remainder recognized thereafter. The final amount of compensation expense to be recognized is partially dependent upon personnel decisions that will be made as part of integration planning. These amounts may be material.\nFor additional information on the FCC's CAF order and the USF program, see \"Business-Regulation\" in Item 1 of Part I of this annual report and see \"Risk Factors-Risks Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report.\n \u2022 Strategic services. Our mix of total business segment revenues continues to migrate from legacy services to strategic services as our small, medium and enterprise business, wholesale and governmental customers increasingly demand integrated data, broadband, hosting and voice services. Our Ethernet-based services in the wholesale market face competition from cable companies and competitive fiber-based telecommunications providers. We anticipate continued pricing pressure for our colocation services as vendors continue to expand their enterprise colocation operations. In recent years, our competitors, as well as several large, diversified technology companies, have made substantial investments in cloud computing. This expansion in competitive cloud computing offerings has led to increased pricing pressure, a migration towards lower-priced cloud-based services and enhanced competition for contracts, and we expect these trends to continue. Customers' demand for new technology has also increased the number of competitors offering strategic services similar to ours. Price compression from each of these above-mentioned competitive pressures has negatively impacted the operating margins of our strategic services, and we expect this trend to continue. Operating costs also impact the operating margins of our strategic services, but to a lesser extent than price compression and customer disconnects. These operating costs include employee costs, sales commissions, software costs on selected services, installation costs and third-party facility costs. We believe increases in operating costs have generally had a greater impact on the operating margins of our strategic services as compared to our legacy services, principally because our strategic services rely more heavily upon the above-listed support functions; \nWe may be required to assess our goodwill for impairment before our next required assessment date of October 31, 2017 under certain circumstances, including any failure to meet our forecasted future operating results or any significant increases in our weighted average cost of capital. In addition, we cannot assure that adverse conditions will not trigger future goodwill impairment assessments or impairment charges. A number of factors, many of which we cannot control, could affect our financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause our actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed in our goodwill impairment assessment. These factors include, but are not limited to, (i) further weakening in the overall economy; (ii) a significant decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization as a result of an adverse change to our overall business operations; (iii) changes in the discount rate we use in our testing; (iv) successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets; (v) adverse changes as a result of regulatory or legislative actions; (vi) a significant adverse change in our legal affairs or in the overall business climate; and (vii) recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of one or more of our subsidiaries that are a component of our segments. For additional information, see \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report. We will continue to monitor certain events that impact our operations to determine if an interim assessment of goodwill impairment should be performed prior to the next required assessment date of October 31, 2017.\nConnect America Fund\nBusiness Segment\nWe have cash management arrangements with certain of our principal subsidiaries, in which substantial portions of the subsidiaries' cash is regularly advanced to us. Although we periodically repay these advances to fund the subsidiaries' cash requirements throughout the year, at any given point in time we may owe a substantial sum to our subsidiaries under these advances, which, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, are eliminated in consolidation and therefore not recognized on our consolidated balance sheets.\n \u2022 provide a wide array of diverse services, including enhanced or additional services that may become available in the future due to, among other things, advances in technology or improvements in our infrastructure; \nIf, as anticipated, we complete the acquisition of Level 3 by the end of third quarter of 2017 in the manner discussed in Note 2-Pending Acquisition of Level 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, we expect our operations, financial position and cash flows to be significantly impacted following the closing of the transaction. We expect to issue a significant amount of new debt to finance the Level 3 acquisition, and we would assume approximately $10.9 billion of Level 3's outstanding debt upon consummating the acquisition. With this additional debt, we would expect our cash paid for interest payments to be significantly higher following the closing of the transaction. We project that our capital expenditures would increase significantly; we anticipate, based on information included in Level 3's annual guidance regarding its estimated 2017 capital expenditures, that Level 3 will spend approximately $100 million to $125 million per month on average, in the period prior to closing, but that amount could be significantly different than amounts that we expect to spend in the months following the closing of the transaction. In connection with consummating the acquisition, we would expect to issue approximately 538 million shares of our common stock to Level 3 stockholders (including shares of CenturyLink common stock expected to be issued in exchange for outstanding Level 3 equity awards), based on the number of Level 3 shares held of record on January 27, 2017. Based on our current quarterly common stock dividend rate of $0.54 per share, this issuance of additional shares would result in an additional incremental dividend payment of approximately $290 million per quarter. Also, we expect our upcoming cash payments for transaction costs, integration costs and debt financing costs to be material primarily following the closing of the transaction. These above factors are expected to result in a net cash outflow for the period of 2017 following the closing. However, we expect we will have sufficient liquidity to more than offset the impact of the net cash outflows.\n\nOur executive officers and our Board of Directors periodically review our sources and potential uses of cash in connection with our annual budgeting process. Generally speaking, our principal funding source is cash from operating activities, and our principal cash requirements include operating expenses, capital expenditures, income taxes, debt repayments, dividends, periodic stock repurchases, periodic pension contributions and other benefits payments. As discussed below, the amount we pay for income taxes is expected to increase for most of 2017, and the amount we pay for retiree healthcare benefits is expected to increase substantially in 2017. The potential impact of the pending sale of our colocation business and data centers and the potential impact of the pending acquisition of Level 3 are further described below.\nFor 2016, the growth in our strategic services revenues was primarily due to increased demand for our Ethernet, MPLS, facilities-based video and VoIP services and from rate increases on various services, which were partially offset by declines in our hosting services and losses of broadband customers. For 2015, the growth in our strategic services revenues was primarily due to increased demand for our Ethernet, MPLS, facilities-based video and IT Services and from rate increases on various services, which were partially offset by declines in our colocation and hosting services.\nSegment Income\nWe also are involved in various legal proceedings that could substantially impact our financial position. See Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for the current status of such legal proceedings.\nOn April 6, 2016, CenturyLink, Inc. issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 7.5% Notes due 2024, in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and other expenses, of $988 million.\nWe incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis in order to enhance and modernize our networks, compete effectively in our markets and expand our service offerings. We evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted impact on revenue growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention) and our expected return on investment. The amount of capital investment is influenced by, among other things, demand for our services and products, cash flow generated by operating activities, cash required for other purposes and regulatory considerations (such as our CAF Phase 2 infrastructure buildout requirements). Based on current circumstances, we estimate that our total capital expenditures for 2017 will be approximately $2.6 billion, inclusive of CAF Phase 2 related capital expenditures, but exclusive of additional capital expenditures with respect to the Level 3 operations that we expect to acquire later this year.\nSegment Results\n\n (5) Reflects only the portion of total obligation that is contractual in nature. See Note 7 below. \nOur segment revenues include all revenues from our strategic services, legacy services and data integration as described in more detail above. Segment revenues are based upon each customer's classification to an individual segment. We report our segment revenues based upon all services provided to that segment's customers. For information on how we allocate expenses to our segments, as well as other additional information about our segments, see Note 14-Segment Information.\n \u2022 provide our broadband and premium services to a higher percentage of our customers; \nOn May 2, 2016, Qwest Corporation paid at maturity the $235 million principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest due under its 8.375% Notes.\n (1) Includes current maturities and capital lease obligations, but excludes unamortized discounts, net and unamortized debt issuance costs. Also, includes $305 million of capital lease obligations related to our colocation operations. See Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information regarding the future commitments for capital leases related to our colocation operations. \nOn August 29, 2016, Qwest Corporation redeemed all $661 million of its 7.375% Notes due 2051, which resulted in a loss of $18 million.\nOn November 3, 2016, we entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement to sell our data centers and colocation business to a consortium led by BC Partners, Inc. and Medina Capital (\"the Purchaser\") in exchange for cash and a minority stake in the consortium's newly-formed global secure infrastructure company. During 2016, as a result of the pending sale, the assets to be sold to the Purchaser have been reclassified as assets held for sale in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the liabilities to be assumed by the Purchaser have been reclassified and presented as current liabilities associated with assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet. As part of the transaction, the Purchaser will assume our capital lease obligations, which amounted to $305 million as of December 31, 2016, related to the properties that we will sell. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals, including a review by the Committee of Foreign Investments in the United States, as well as other customary closing conditions.\nWe perform annual internal reviews to evaluate the reasonableness of the depreciable lives for our property, plant and equipment. Our reviews utilize models that take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history, assumptions about technology evolution and, in certain instances, actuarially determined probabilities to estimate the remaining life of our asset base.\nWe are an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing an array of services to our residential and business customers. Our communications services include local and long-distance voice, broadband, Multi-Protocol Label Switching (\"MPLS\"), private line (including special access), Ethernet, colocation, hosting (including cloud hosting and managed hosting), data integration, video, network, public access, Voice over Internet Protocol (\"VoIP\"), information technology and other ancillary services. We strive to maintain our customer relationships by, among other things, bundling our service offerings to provide our customers with a complete offering of integrated communications services.\nConsumer segment revenues decreased by $119 million, or 2%, for year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in our consumer segment revenues was primarily due to the declines in our legacy services revenues, which were partially offset by increases in our strategic revenues. The decline in our legacy services revenues for both periods was primarily due to lower local and long-distance voice service volumes associated with access line losses resulting from the competitive and technological factors noted above. The increase in our strategic services revenues was primarily due to 2016 rate increases resulting from various pricing initiatives on broadband, Prism TV and other strategic products and services, and increases in the number of our Prism TV customers, which were partially offset by a decline in broadband customers. Consumer segment revenues increased by $24 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in strategic services revenues was primarily due to increases in the number of Prism TV customers, as well as from 2015 price increases on various services. The decline in legacy services revenues was primarily due to declines in local and long-distance services volumes associated with access line losses resulting from the competitive and technological factors as further described above.\nAdditionally, in 2015, the lower depreciation expense was further offset by the impact of changes in the estimated lives of certain property, plant and equipment which resulted in additional depreciation. The changes in the estimated lives of certain property, plant and equipment resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $48 million for 2015, which was more than fully offset by the decrease in depreciation expense noted above. In addition, we developed a plan to migrate customers from one of our networks to another, which began in late 2014 and ended in late 2015. As a result, we implemented changes in estimates that reduced the remaining economic lives of certain network assets. The impact from the above-noted changes in estimates and network migration resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $90 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have identified certain policies and estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our past or present results of operations related to (i) goodwill, customer relationships and other intangible assets; (ii) property, plant and equipment; (iii) pension and post-retirement benefits; (iv) loss contingencies and litigation reserves; (v) Connect America Fund; and (vi) income taxes. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or they have the potential to have a material impact, on our consolidated financial statements and because they require us to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions made when accounting for the items described below were reasonable, based on information available at the time they were made. However, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) During 2016 and 2015, we recognized an incremental $201 million and $215 million, respectively, of revenue associated with the FCC's Connect America Fund Phase 2 support program as compared to the interstate USF program. For additional information, see Note 1-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report. \n \u2022 Strategic services, which include primarily broadband, MPLS, Ethernet, colocation, hosting (including cloud hosting and managed hosting), video (including our facilities-based video services, which we offer in 16 markets), VoIP, information technology and other ancillary services; \nOur provision for income taxes includes amounts for tax consequences deferred to future periods. We record deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflecting future tax consequences attributable to tax credit carryforwards, differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and the tax bases of those assets and liabilities and tax net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs. Deferred taxes are computed using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.\n \u2022 increase prices on our products and services if and when practicable; \nWe amortize customer relationships primarily over an estimated life of 10 to 15 years, using either the sum-of-the-years-digits or the straight-line methods, depending on the type of customer. We amortize capitalized software using the straight-line method over estimated lives ranging up to 7 years, except for approximately $237 million of our capitalized software costs, which represents costs to develop an integrated billing and customer care system which is amortized using the straight-line method over a 20 year period. We annually review the estimated lives and methods used to amortize our other intangible assets, primarily capitalized software. The amount of future amortization expense may differ materially from current amounts, depending on the results of our annual reviews.\nThe following tables present additional metrics related to our data centers: \nOn December 23, 2016, a subsidiary of Embarq Corporation redeemed $5 million of its 8.375% Notes due 2025, which resulted in an immaterial loss.\nPending Acquisition of Level 3\nInterest Expense\nOn January 29, 2016, Qwest Corporation issued $235 million aggregate principal amount of 7% Notes due 2056, in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and other expenses, of $227 million.\nWe are organized into operating segments based on customer type, business and consumer. These operating segments are our two reportable segments in our consolidated financial statements:\nIn 2015, approximately 45% of the qualified pension plan's January 1, 2015 net actuarial loss balance of $2.740 billion was subject to amortization as a component of net periodic expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits, which ranges from 8 to 9 years for the plan. The other 55% of the qualified pension plan's beginning net actuarial loss balance was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2015. The entire beginning net actuarial loss of $277 million for the post-retirement benefit plans was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2015.\n \u2022 pursue acquisitions of additional assets if available at attractive prices; \nWe currently expect to continue our current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends in respect of our common stock subject to our Board of Directors' discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Our current quarterly common stock dividend rate is $0.54 per share, as approved by our Board of Directors, which we believe is a dividend rate per share that gives us the flexibility to balance our multiple objectives of managing our business, paying our fixed commitments and returning cash to our shareholders. Assuming continued payment during 2017 at this rate of $0.54 per share, our average total dividends paid each quarter prior to the Level 3 acquisition would be approximately $294 million based on our current number of outstanding shares (which does not reflect shares that we expect to issue in connection with the Level 3 acquisition or any other shares that we might issue or repurchase in future periods). See \"Risk Factors-Risks Affecting Our Business\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report.\nDebt and Other Financing Arrangements\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $121 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in severance expenses associated with our recent workforce reduction, higher payments of employee health care claims, bad debt and other expenses (including fees related to the Level 3 acquisition), which were partially offset by reductions in professional fees and property and other taxes. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $19 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower benefit expenses, insurance costs and asset impairment charges. These decreases were partially offset by increases in bad debt expense, external commissions and regulatory fines of $15 million associated with a 911 system outage.\n \u2022 Selling, general and administrative expenses are corporate overhead and other operating expenses. These expenses include: employee-related expenses (such as salaries, wages, internal commissions, benefits and professional fees) directly attributable to selling products or services and employee-related expenses for administrative functions; marketing and advertising; property and other operating taxes and fees; external commissions; litigation expenses associated with general matters; bad debt expense; and other selling, general and administrative expenses.  These expense classifications may not be comparable to those of other companies.\nWe are subject to material obligations under our existing defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement benefit plans. At December 31, 2016, the accounting unfunded status of our qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans and qualified post-retirement benefit plans was $2.409 billion and $3.360 billion, respectively. See Note 9-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information about our pension and post-retirement benefit arrangements.\nIn response to the continued decline of our legacy services revenues and to better align our workforce with our workload requirements, we periodically implement workforce reduction programs. In the third quarter of 2016, we announced plans to reduce our workforce, initially through voluntary severance packages and the balance through involuntary reductions. We recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016 a charge for severance expenses and other one-time termination benefits of $164 million, $98 million of which remained to be paid as of December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2016, we operated approximately 11.1 million access lines in 37 states and served approximately 5.9 million broadband subscribers and 325 thousand Prism TV subscribers. We also operated 58 data centers throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Our methodology for counting access lines, broadband subscribers and data centers, which is described further in the operational metrics table below under \"Results of Operations\", and our methodology for counting Prism TV subscribers may not be comparable to those of other companies.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe will continue to monitor our future sources and uses of cash, and anticipate that we will make adjustments to our capital allocation strategies when, as and if determined by our Board of Directors. We typically use our revolving credit facility as a source of liquidity for operating activities and our other cash requirements.\nFrom time to time, we change the categorization of our products and services, and we may make similar changes in the future. During the second quarter of 2016, we determined that because of declines due to customer migration to other strategic products and services, certain of our business low-bandwidth data services, specifically our private line (including special access) services in our business segment, are more closely aligned with our legacy services than with our strategic services. As described in greater detail in Note 14-Segment Information in our Notes, these operating revenues are now reflected as legacy services.\nDue to rapid changes in technology and the competitive environment, determining the estimated economic life of telecommunications plant and equipment requires a significant amount of judgment. We regularly review data on utilization of equipment, asset retirements and salvage values to determine adjustments to our depreciation rates. The effect of a hypothetical one year increase or decrease in the estimated remaining useful lives of our property, plant and equipment would have decreased depreciation expense by approximately $390 million annually or increased depreciation expense by approximately $550 million annually, respectively.\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets is the long-term rate of return we expect to earn on the plans' assets in the future, net of administrative expenses paid from plan assets. The rate of return is determined by the strategic allocation of plan assets and the long-term risk and return forecast for each asset class. The forecasts for each asset class are generated primarily from an analysis of the long-term expectations of various third party investment management organizations to which we then add a factor of 50 basis points to reflect the benefit we expect to result from our active management of the assets. The expected rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually and revised, as necessary, to reflect changes in the financial markets and our investment strategy.\nTo compute the expected return on pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets, we apply an expected rate of return to the fair value of the pension plan assets and to the fair value of the post-retirement benefit plan assets adjusted for contribution timing and for projected benefit payments to be made from the plan assets. Annual market volatility for these assets (higher or lower than expected return) is reflected in the net actuarial losses.\nPotential Impact of the Sale of Our Colocation Business and Data Centers\n\n (7) The table is limited solely to contractual payment obligations and does not include: \n\nWe are required to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate an impairment may have occurred. We are required to write-down the value of goodwill in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. Our reporting units are not discrete legal entities with discrete financial statements. Our assets and liabilities are employed in and relate to the operations of our reporting units. Therefore, the equity carrying value and future cash flows must be estimated each time a goodwill impairment analysis is performed on a reporting unit. As a result, our assets, liabilities and cash flows are assigned to reporting units using reasonable and consistent allocation methodologies. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions are required to perform these assignments. We believe these estimates, judgments and assumptions to be reasonable, but changes in many of these can significantly affect each reporting unit's equity carrying value and future cash flows utilized for our goodwill impairment test. Our annual assessment date for testing goodwill impairment is October 31.\n (4) We have various long-term, non-cancelable purchase commitments for advertising and promotion services, including advertising and marketing at sports arenas and other venues and events. We also have purchase commitments with third-party vendors for operating, installation and maintenance services for facilities. In addition, we have service-related commitments with various vendors for data processing, technical and software support services. Future payments under certain service contracts will vary depending on our actual usage. In the table above, we estimated payments for these service contracts based on estimates of the level of services we expect to receive. Includes $80 million of purchase commitments related to our colocation operations. See Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for additional information regarding the purchase commitments related to our colocation operations. \n______________________________________________________________________ \nConsumer segment expenses increased by $68 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in our consumer segment expenses was primarily due to increases in costs related to Prism TV (resulting from higher content volume and rates), professional fees, sales commissions, bad debt expense and network costs, which were partially offset by reductions in salaries and wages from lower headcount and payment processing fees. Consumer segment expenses increased by $11 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily due to increases in Prism TV content costs (resulting from higher volume and rates) and bad debt expense, which were partially offset by reductions in employee-related costs, facility costs, fleet expenses and network expenses.\nBy operating internationally, we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the foreign currencies used by our international subsidiaries, primarily the British Pound, and secondarily the Canadian Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Hong Kong Dollar and the Singapore Dollar. Although the percentages of our consolidated revenues and costs that are denominated in these currencies are immaterial, future volatility in exchange rates and an increase in the number of transactions could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations. We use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to this foreign currency risk, measuring the change in financial position arising from a hypothetical 10% change in the exchange rates of these currencies, relative to the U.S. Dollar, with all other variables held constant. The aggregate potential change in the fair value of financial assets resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in these exchange rates was $18 million at December 31, 2016.\nIn 2015, we accepted CAF funding from the FCC of approximately $500 million per year for six years to fund the deployment of voice and broadband capable infrastructure for approximately 1.2 million rural households and businesses (living units) in 33 states under the CAF Phase 2 high-cost support program. This program provides a monthly high-cost subsidy similar to the support provided by the FCC's previous cost reimbursement programs. Although we believe that there is no specific authoritative U.S. GAAP guidance for the treatment of government assistance, we identified three acceptable methods to account for these funds: (1) recognize revenue when entitled to receive cash, (2) defer cash received until the living units are enabled to receive the service at the FCC specified level, or (3) record the cash received as contra capital. After assessing these alternatives, we have determined that we will recognize CAF Phase 2 funds each month as revenue when we are entitled to receive the cash less a deferred amount. The amount of revenue deferred in 2016 was approximately $12 million. We believe our recognition methodology is consistent with other companies in our industry in the United States, but may not necessarily be consistent with companies outside the United States that receive similar government funding, and we cannot provide assurances to this effect.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nThe following tables summarize the results of operations from our business segment: \nOther Matters\nFor information on our outstanding debt securities, see immediately below \"Future Contractual Obligations\" and Note 5-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.\nSegment Revenues\nFurther analysis of our segment operating revenues and trends impacting our performance are provided below in \"Segment Results.\"\nSegment Expenses\nThe discount rate for each plan is the rate at which we believe we could effectively settle the plan's benefit obligations as of the end of the year. We selected each plan's discount rate based on a cash flow matching analysis using hypothetical yield curves from U.S. corporate bonds rated high quality and projections of the future benefit payments that constitute the projected benefit obligation for the plans. This process establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year's benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. The spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 60th to 90th percentile of U.S. high quality bonds.\nOur pension plan contains provisions that allow us, from time to time, to offer lump sum payment options to certain former employees in settlement of their future retirement benefits. These lump sum payments are paid from the trust that holds the plan's assets. Under pension settlement accounting, we record an accounting settlement charge associated with these lump sum payments only if, in the aggregate, they exceed the sum of the annual service and interest costs for the plan's net periodic pension benefit cost. There were no pension lump sum offerings in 2016, other than those to eligible employees who terminated during 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we made cash settlement payments to former employees for lump sum offers of approximately $356 million, but pension settlement accounting was not triggered in 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we made cash settlement payments to former employees for lump sum offers of approximately $460 million, which triggered pension settlement accounting and resulted in us recording additional pension expense of $63 million. Pension expense is allocated to cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), selling, general and administrative and to capital projects. See Note 9-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, for additional information on the pension lump sum offers.\n\nSubstantially all of our post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits plans are unfunded. Several trusts hold assets that have been used to help cover the health care costs of certain retirees. Assets in the post-retirement trusts have been substantially depleted as of December 31, 2016; however, we will continue to pay certain benefits through the trusts. The fair value of these trust assets was approximately $53 million at December 31, 2016, with a portion comprised of investments with restricted liquidity. Benefits not paid through the trusts will be paid directly by us. As described further in Note 9-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report, aggregate benefits paid by us under these plans (net of participant contributions and direct subsidy receipts) were $129 million, $116 million and $88 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, while the amounts paid from the trust were $145 million, $163 million and $219 million, respectively. For additional information on our expected future benefits payments for our post-retirement benefit plans, please see Note 9-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II in this annual report.\nOther Consolidated Results\nMarket Risk\nBased on information provided to us by Level 3, as of December 31, 2016, Level 3 had approximately $9.0 billion of NOL carryforwards that we expect to acquire in connection with the Level 3 transaction. We cannot assure you that we will be able to use these NOL carryforwards fully, or at all. See \"Risk Factors-Risk Relating to Our Pending Acquisition of Level 3-We cannot assure you, whether, when or in what amounts we will be able to use Level 3's net operating loss carryforwards following the Level 3 acquisition\" in Item 1A of Part I of this annual report.\nAs of the date of this annual report, the credit ratings for the senior unsecured debt of CenturyLink, Inc. and Qwest Corporation were as follows: \nOperating Revenues\n (3) During 2014, we recognized a $60 million tax benefit associated with a deduction for the tax basis for worthless stock in a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary and a $63 million pension settlement charge.  The following table summarizes our access lines, broadband subscribers, Prism TV subscribers, data centers and number of employees: \nNormal retirements of property, plant and equipment are charged against accumulated depreciation, with no gain or loss recognized. We depreciate such property on the straight-line method over estimated service lives ranging from 3 to 45 years.\n______________________________________________________________________ ",

long-distance voice, broadband, MPLS, Ethernet, colocation, hosting, video, and IT services. \n\n- They operate two main business segments - business and consumer. The business segment provides strategic, legacy, and data integration products and services to business, wholesale, and government customers. The consumer segment provides strategic and legacy services to residential customers.\n\n- Total revenues for 2016 were $17.5 billion, down 2% from 2015, mainly due to declines in legacy services revenue. Net income was $626 million in 2016, down 29% from 2015. \n\n- The company expects continued revenue pressure on legacy services like voice and private line due to competition, technology shifts, and access line losses. Strategic revenues from broadband, Ethernet, MPLS, colocation, and video grew in 2016 but face price compression.\n\n- Operating expenses decreased 1% in 2016 versus 2015. Depreciation and amortization fell due to assets being fully depreciated. \n\n- Capital expenditures were $2.9 billion in 2016, focused on enhancing networks and strategic services. Estimated 2017 capital spending is $2.6 billion.\n\n- The company has agreed to acquire Level 3 Communications. This is expected to significantly impact operations, cash flows, capital spending and debt levels. \n\n- CenturyLink also agreed to sell its colocation business and data centers for estimated net proceeds of $1.5-$1.7 billion. This will reduce future cash flows.\n\n- The company pays a common stock dividend of $0.54 per share per quarter. Total 2017 dividends are estimated at $1.2 billion.\n\nIn summary, CenturyLink faces revenue pressures but is transforming its business mix towards strategic services. The Level 3 acquisition and data center sale will significantly impact the company's financials and operations."}
