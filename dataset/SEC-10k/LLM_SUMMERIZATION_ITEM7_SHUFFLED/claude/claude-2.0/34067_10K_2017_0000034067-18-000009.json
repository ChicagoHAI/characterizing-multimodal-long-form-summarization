Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical Consolidated Financial Statements and notes, as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this annual report.\nUnless stated otherwise, all dollar figures in this report are presented in thousands (000s). N/M indicates that the change in dollars or percentage was not meaningful.\nOverview\nGeneral\nDMC operates a diversified family of technical product and process businesses serving the energy, industrial and infrastructure markets. Our businesses operate through a global network of manufacturing, distribution and sales facilities. Our business is organized into two segments: NobelClad and DynaEnergetics.\nOur diversified segments each provide a suite of unique technical products to niche sectors of the global energy, industrial and infrastructure markets, and each has established a strong or leading position in the markets in which it participates. With an underlying focus on generating free cash flow, our objective is to sustain and grow the market share of our businesses through increased market penetration, development of new applications, and research and development of new and adjacent products that can be sold across our global network of sales and distribution facilities. We routinely explore acquisitions of related businesses that could strengthen or add to our existing product portfolios, or expand our geographic footprint and market presence. We also seek acquisition opportunities outside our current markets that would complement our existing businesses and enable us to build a stronger and more diverse company.\nNobelClad\nNobelClad is a global leader in the production of explosion-welded clad metal plates for use in the construction of corrosion resistant industrial processing equipment and specialized transition joints. While a significant portion of the demand for our clad metal products is driven by maintenance and retrofit projects at existing chemical processing, petrochemical processing, oil refining, and aluminum smelting facilities, new plant construction and large plant expansion projects also account for a significant portion of total demand. These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and timing of new order inflow remains difficult to predict. We use backlog as a primary means to measure the immediate outlook for our NobelClad business. We define backlog\u201d at any given point in time as all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time. Most firm purchase orders and commitments are realized, and we expect to fill most backlog orders within the following 12 months. NobelClad's backlog increased to $37,529 at December 31, 2017 from $31,634 at December 31, 2016.\nDynaEnergetics\nDynaEnergetics designs, manufactures and distributes products utilized by the global oil and gas industry principally for the perforation of oil and gas wells. These products are sold to oilfield service companies in the U.S., Europe, Canada, South America, Africa, the Middle East, Russia, and Asia. DynaEnergetics also sells directly to end-users. The market for perforating products, which are used during the well completion process, generally corresponds with oil and gas exploration and production activity. Exploration activity over the last several years has led to increasingly complex well completion operations, which in turn, has increased the demand for high quality and technically advanced perforating products.\nCost of products sold for DynaEnergetics includes the cost of metals, explosives and other raw materials used to manufacture shaped charges, detonating products and perforating guns as well as employee compensation and benefits, depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment, manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses.\nFactors Affecting Results\nThe following items impacted the comparability of the company's results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>DynaEnergetics' sales of $121,253 in 2017 increased 80% compared with 2016 driven by a recovery in the North American unconventional well-completions sector and reflected increased well-stage counts; higher completion intensity and longer laterals; and increased market penetration of DynaEnergetics' perforating products and systems, including the DynaSelect detonator and the DynaStage system.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NobelClad's sales of $71,550 in 2017 decreased 22% compared with 2016 as weak capital spending in NobelClad's industrial infrastructure and energy markets resulted in a decline in core repair and maintenance work and the absence of large projects.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Consolidated gross profit of 31% in 2017 increased from 25% in 2016.

Restructuring expenses of $1,202 in 2016 primarily related to severance for headcount reductions and lease termination costs at DynaEnergetics.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A goodwill impairment charge of $17,584 related to the NobelClad reporting unit was recorded in the third quarter of 2017 to reflect the decline in activity levels in NobelClad's primary end markets during the second half of the year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Consolidated selling, general, and administrative expenses were $45,724 in 2017 compared with $38,741 in 2016. The increase primarily was due to higher patent litigation expenses at DynaEnergetics and increased salaries and wages from headcount additions and higher variable incentive compensation expense.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net debt of $9,001 (comprised of $17,984 indebtedness net of $8,983 in cash) decreased 3% from December 31, 2016.

The facility, which is scheduled to open during the third quarter of 2018, will substantially increase DynaEnergetics' component manufacturing and DynaStage assembly capacity. During the first half of 2018, DynaEnergetics plans to add a second automated DynaSelect detonator line at its facility in Troisdorf, Germany. In the second half of 2018, the business plans to add a second automated shaped-charge manufacturing line at Blum, which will more than double its shaped charge production capacity in the U.S.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In January 2018, DynaEnergetics announced the implementation of a global price increase applicable to all products. The increase varies by product line and generally ranges from 5% to 8%. Well completion activity is accelerating across DynaEnergetics' global markets, and as customers work to keep pace with the recovery, the business' advanced products and systems are enabling improved efficiencies, greater reliability and lower operating costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The recent decline in NobelClad's core repair and maintenance orders from the downstream energy industry has continued in the first quarter of 2018. Despite that, fabricator customers expect improved demand for long-delayed repair, maintenance and upgrade work. It appears higher energy prices and renewed enthusiasm for domestic infrastructure spending may pull forward a number of these projects, which we believe will lead to a recovery in bookings activity during 2018. In October 2017, NobelClad received a $7.4 million purchase order related to a petrochemical project in Asia, which is reflected in NobelClad's year-end backlog, and is expected to be shipped in the first half of 2018. The order is the largest booked by NobelClad in more than four years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) measure that we believe provides an important indicator of our ongoing operating performance and that we use in operational and financial decision-making. We define EBITDA as net income or loss plus or minus net interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes from EBITDA stock-based compensation, restructuring and impairment charges and, when appropriate, other items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC's operating performance (as further described in the tables below). As a result, internal management reports used during monthly operating reviews feature Adjusted EBITDA and certain management incentive awards are based, in part, on the amount of Adjusted EBITDA achieved during the year.\nNet Debt is a non-GAAP measure we use to supplement information in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We define net debt as lines of credit less cash and cash equivalents. In addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses this information to evaluate its performance, and we believe that certain investors may do the same.\nThe presence of non-GAAP financial measures in this report is not intended to suggest that such measures be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or as superior to, DMC's GAAP information, and investors are cautioned that the non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are limited in their usefulness. Because not all companies use identical calculations, DMC's presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis annual report and the documents incorporated by reference into it contain certain forward-looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigations Reform Act of 1995. Words such as anticipates,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d plans,\u201d believes,\u201d seeks,\u201d estimates,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d continue,\u201d project,\u201d forecast,\u201d and similar expressions, as well as statements in the future tense, identify forward-looking statements. Such statements include projections, guidance and other statements regarding our future expected financial position and operating results, our growth and business strategy, our expectations regarding the oil and gas industry, the timing and costs of our Blum, Texas and other expansion plans, our plans to consolidate NobelClad's European production facilities, including the timing and costs involved in closing manufacturing operations in France, our expectations regarding NobelClad's sales, bookings, and backlog in 2018, impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our financing plans, our future liquidity position and factors impacting such position, and the outcome of the pending GEODynamics and anti-dumping matters.\nThese forward-looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements.

The increase in DynaEnergetics' net sales partially was offset by a 22% decline in NobelClad's net sales as weak capital spending in NobelClad's industrial infrastructure and energy markets resulted in a decline in core repair and maintenance work and the absence of large projects.\nGross profit percentage increased compared with 2016 primarily due to higher average selling prices and improved product mix in DynaEnergetics and better project mix in NobelClad.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased compared with 2016 primarily due to higher outside legal expenses related to patent infringement defense costs in DynaEnergetics, higher salaries and wages from headcount additions and increased variable incentive compensation, and higher stock-based compensation expense.\nSelling and distribution expenses increased compared with 2016 principally due to higher salaries and benefits and increased outside professional services partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense.\nRestructuring expenses in 2017 related to the announced closures of NobelClad's manufacturing facility in France and DynaEnergetics' sales and distribution operations in Kazakhstan. In 2016, restructuring expenses related to severance for headcount reductions at DynaEnergetics' Troisdorf, Germany and Austin, Texas locations, lease termination costs to exit administrative offices in Austin, Texas, costs related to the relocation of perforating gun manufacturing operations in Germany, and the accelerated vesting of stock awards in connection with the elimination of certain positions.\nGoodwill impairment charge was recorded in 2017 to fully impair NobelClad's goodwill balance. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" for further discussion.\nOperating loss increased compared with 2016 due to the goodwill impairment charge and restructuring expenses combined with higher corporate unallocated and stock-based compensation expenses. The one-time impairment and restructuring charges and increased operating expenses partially were offset by increased sales volume, higher average selling\nprices, and favorable product mix in DynaEnergetics. Corporate unallocated and stock-based compensation expenses are not allocated to our business segments.\nOther income (expense), net in 2017 primarily was made up of realized and unrealized foreign currency losses. In 2016, other income (expense), net principally consisted of realized and unrealized foreign currency gains. Our subsidiaries frequently enter into inter-company and third party transactions that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. Changes in exchange rates with respect to these transactions will result in unrealized gains or losses if unsettled at the end of the reporting period or realized gains or losses at settlement of the transaction. During the third quarter of 2017, we began using foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities of one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated asset and liability positions. None of these contracts are designated as accounting hedges, and all changes in the fair value of the forward contracts are recognized immediately in \"Other income (expense), net\" within our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInterest income (expense), net increased compared with last year primarily due to expensing $261 of deferred debt issuance costs in conjunction with amending our credit facility in March 2017 combined with higher interest rates on a higher average outstanding line of credit balance.\nIncome tax provision of $3,569 for 2017 compared with an income tax provision of $797 for 2016. The current-year income tax provision included $946 of which was a transition tax related to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"). The transition tax is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. To determine the amount of the transition tax, we must determine, among other things, the amount of post-1986 E&P of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. We made a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and recorded a provisional transition tax obligation of $946, of which $871 is recorded in other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, we continue to gather additional information to compute more precisely the post-1986 E&P and related non-U.S. income taxes paid. The TCJA's transition tax is payable over eight years beginning in 2018. Upon completion of the analysis of post-1986 E&P and related non-U.S. income taxes paid, revisions to our transition tax obligation, if necessary, will be recorded in the 2018 tax provision. Additionally, we currently are unable to recognize tax benefits associated with losses incurred in certain jurisdictions due to valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions.\nNet loss in 2017 primarily was a result of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge and restructuring expenses and the other factors discussed above. Net loss in 2017 was $18,853, or $1.31 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $6,505, or $0.46 per diluted share in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased compared with 2016 primarily due to the factors discussed above. See \"Overview\" above for the explanation of the use of Adjusted EBITDA. The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA.\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

to a 13% decrease in DynaEnergetics, which partially was offset by a 1% increase in NobelClad. The decline in DynaEnergetics was due to declining activity levels in the oil and gas well-completions sector and lower average selling prices. The increase in NobelClad primarily related to a large project for the semiconductor capital equipment industry that shipped in the second quarter of 2016.\nGross profit increased compared with 2015 primarily due to the impact of a $6,205 accrual recorded in 2015 for anti-dumping and countervailing duties resulting from an unfavorable scope ruling from the Department of Commerce on prior imports of metals primarily used by DynaEnergetics for gun carrier tubing. Gross profit and gross profit percentage in 2016 were adversely affected by lower average selling prices in DynaEnergetics, a lower proportion of sales in DynaEnergetics relative to NobelClad, and the impact of higher research and development expenses in DynaEnergetics.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased compared with 2015 primarily due to higher outside legal expenses in DynaEnergetics due to patent infringement and anti-dumping litigation.\nSelling and distribution expenses decreased compared with 2015 principally due to lower salaries and benefits, a reduction in bad debt expense, and lower outside sales agent commissions in DynaEnergetics driven by sales volume in territories in which we do not have an internal sales team.\nRestructuring expenses in 2016 related to severance for headcount reductions at DynaEnergetics' locations in Troisdorf, Germany and Austin, Texas, lease termination costs to exit administrative offices in Austin, Texas, costs related to relocation of perforating gun manufacturing operations in Germany, and the accelerated vesting of stock awards in connection with the elimination of certain positions. In 2015, restructuring expenses at NobelClad related to shifting of the majority of clad metal plate production from facilities in both Rivesaltes, France and W\u00fcrgendorf, Germany to the new manufacturing facility in Liebenscheid, Germany. DynaEnergetics restructuring expenses related to the consolidation of perforating gun manufacturing centers, the closure of distribution centers, and the reduction of the administrative workforce at the corporate offices in Troisdorf, Germany. Corporate restructuring expenses relate to the elimination of certain positions in our corporate office and the severance and expense related to the acceleration of unvested stock awards.\nGoodwill impairment charge in 2015 was to fully write off goodwill related to the DynaEnergetics segment. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" for further discussion.\nOperating loss decreased compared with 2015 due to the goodwill impairment at DynaEnergetics combined with the accrual for anti-dumping and countervailing duties in 2015.\nOther income (expense), net in 2016 principally consisted of realized and unrealized foreign currency gains. In 2015, other income (expense), net principally consisted of realized and unrealized foreign currency losses. Our subsidiaries frequently enter into inter-company and third party transactions that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. Changes in exchange rates with respect to these transactions will result in unrealized gains or losses if unsettled at the end of the reporting period or realized gains or losses at settlement of the transaction.\nInterest income (expense), net decreased compared with 2015 primarily due to writing off $508 of deferred debt issuance costs in December 2015 after entering into a credit facility amendment. Interest expense on our lines of credit was lower in 2016 from lower interest on a smaller average outstanding balance, partially offset by higher interest on the accrued anti-dumping and countervailing duties in DynaEnergetics.\nIncome tax provision of $797 for 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of $2,118 for 2015. We were unable to recognize tax benefits associated with losses incurred in certain jurisdictions due to valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions.\nNet loss in 2016 was $6,505, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $23,971, or $1.72 per diluted share, in 2015.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased compared with 2015 primarily due to the factors discussed above.

Segment operating income (loss) is defined as revenues less expenses identifiable to the segment. DMC operating income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA include unallocated corporate expenses and stock-based compensation expense, which are not allocated to our business segments. Segment operating income will reconcile to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes by deducting unallocated corporate expenses, including stock-based compensation, net other expense, net interest expense, and income tax provision (benefit).\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the net sales, segment operating income or loss, and Adjusted EBITDA for each segment was

We believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our current credit facilities and any future replacement thereof will be sufficient to fund the working capital, debt service, dividends, announced expansion plans for DynaEnergetics as well as other capital expenditure requirements of our current business operations for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations will depend upon our success in executing our strategies. If we are unable to (i) realize sales from our backlog; (ii) secure new customer orders; (iii) continue selling products at attractive margins; and (iv) continue to implement cost-effective internal processes, our ability to meet cash requirements through operating activities could be impacted. Also, continued heightened litigation costs or unfavorable court decisions in ongoing patent infringement litigation or anti-dumping and countervailing duties (\"AD/CVD\") matters could negatively impact our ability to meet future cash requirements. Furthermore, any restriction on the availability of borrowings under our credit facilities could negatively affect our ability to meet future cash requirements. In March 2017, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been declared effective, and on which we registered for sale up to $150 million of certain of our securities from time to time and on terms that we may determine in the future. Our ability to access this capital may be limited by market conditions at the time of any future potential offering. There can be no assurance that any such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe declared and paid quarterly dividends aggregating $0.08 per share in 2017 and $0.08 per share in 2016. We may pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Future dividends may be affected by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements, future business prospects, debt covenant compliance considerations, changes in income tax laws, and any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Any determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors.\nDebt facilities\nOn March 8, 2018, we entered into a five-year $75,000 syndicated credit agreement ( credit facility\u201d) which replaced in its entirety our prior syndicated credit facility entered into on February 23, 2015. The new credit facility allows for revolving loans of up to $50,000 with a $20,000 US dollar equivalent sublimit for alternative currency loans. In addition, the new agreement provides for a $25,000 Capital Expenditure Facility ( Capex Facility)\u201d which is to be used to finance our DynaEnergetics manufacturing expansion project in Blum, Texas. The Capex facility allows for advances to fund capital expenditures of the Blum expansion project during year one of the credit facility. At the end of year one, the Capex Facility will convert to a term loan which will be amortizable at 12.5% of principal per year with a balloon payment for the outstanding balance upon the credit facility maturity date in year five. The new facility has a $100,000 accordion feature to increase the commitments under the revolving loan class and/or by adding a term loan subject to approval by applicable lenders. We entered into the credit facility with a syndicate of three banks, with KeyBank, N.A. acting as administrative agent. The syndicated credit facility is secured by the assets of DMC including accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets, as well as guarantees and share pledges by DMC and its subsidiaries.\nBorrowings under the $50,000 revolving loan and $25,000 Capex term loan can be in the form of one, two, three, or six month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) loans. Additionally, US dollar borrowings on the revolving loan can be in the form of Base Rate loans (Base Rate borrowings are based on the greater of the administrative agent's Prime rates, an adjusted Federal Funds rates or an adjusted LIBOR rate). LIBOR loans bear interest at the applicable LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin (varying from 1.50% to 3.00%). Base Rate loans bear interest at the defined Base rate plus an applicable margin (varying from 0.50% to 2.00%).\nBorrowings under the $20,000 Alternate Currency sublimit can be in Euros, Canadian dollars, Pounds sterling, and in any other currency acceptable to the administrative agent. Alternative currency borrowings denominated in Euros, Pounds sterling, and any other currency that is dealt with on the London Interbank Deposit Market shall be comprised of LIBOR loans and bear interest at the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin (varying from 1.50% to 3.00%).\nThe credit facility includes various covenants and restrictions, certain of which relate to the payment of dividends or other distributions to stockholders; redemption of capital stock; incurrence of additional indebtedness; mortgaging, pledging or disposition of major assets; and maintenance of specified ratios.\nAs of December 31, 2017, U.S. dollar revolving loans of $18,250 were outstanding under our 2015 syndicated credit facility and our available borrowing capacity was approximately $16,750.\nThe leverage ratio is defined in the 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, for any trailing four quarter period, as the ratio of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness (as defined in the agreement) on the last day of such period to Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA for such period. The maximum leverage ratio permitted by our 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, is 3.0 to 1.0. The actual leverage ratio as of December 31, 2017, calculated in accordance with the 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, was 0.82 to 1.0.\nThe debt service coverage ratio is defined in the 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, for any trailing four quarter period, as the ratio of (x) Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA for such period minus the sum of cash dividends, certain cash income taxes, and capital expenditures for such period to (y) the sum of cash interest expense for such period and scheduled principal payments of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness actually made during such period. The 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, required a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.35 to 1.0. The actual debt service coverage ratio for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2017, calculated in accordance with the 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, was 12.74 to 1.0.\nOur 2015 syndicated credit facility also includes various other covenants and restrictions, certain of which relate to the payment of dividends or other distributions to stockholders, redemption of capital stock, incurrence of additional indebtedness, mortgaging, and pledging or disposition of major assets. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of our credit facilities.\nWe also maintain a line of credit with a German bank for certain European operations. This line of credit provides a borrowing capacity of 4,000 Euros.\nOther contractual obligations and commitments\nThe table below presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates for our debt obligations and other contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due by Period\nAs of December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multicurrency revolver (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License agreements obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>796\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents outstanding borrowings under our U.S. dollar revolving line of credit.

These amounts are not reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCash flows from operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $6,747 in 2017 compared with $18,198 for 2016. The decline primarily was due to increased net working capital requirements from higher sales and tendering $3,049 in AD/CVD amounts to U.S. Customs in March 2017 pending ultimate resolution of the AD/CVD case.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $18,198 in 2016 compared to $1,618 in 2015. The year-over-year increase of $16,580 was driven by an improvement in net working capital. We experienced favorable net working capital changes of $10,081 in 2016 compared to unfavorable changes in net working capital of $3,068 in 2015. Favorable changes in our 2016 net working capital included decreases of $6,829, $2,679 and $1,002 in inventory, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses, respectively, and decreases of $510 and $223 in accrued expenses and other liabilities and in customer advances. The favorable working capital changes partially were offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $1,338.\nCash flows from investing activities\nNet cash flows used in investing activities in 2017 totaled $6,184 and primarily consisted of acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $4,025 for DynaEnergetics and $1,584 for NobelClad.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities in 2016 totaled $5,702 and primarily consisted of acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $4,448 for DynaEnergetics and $1,217 for NobelClad.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities in 2015 totaled $5,326 and consisted of acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $3,668 for DynaEnergetics and $1,376 for NobelClad.\nCash flows from financing activities\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities for 2017 totaled $647, which included net borrowings on bank lines of credit of $2,000, offset by payment of quarterly dividends of $1,174.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities for 2016 totaled $12,107, which included net repayments on bank lines of credit of $11,250 and payment of quarterly dividends of $1,150.\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities for 2015 totaled $1,788, which included net borrowings on bank lines of credit of $5,003, payment of quarterly dividends of $2,260, and payment of deferred debt issuance costs of $1,222.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur historical Consolidated Financial Statements and notes to our historical Consolidated Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that our management make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. However, the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity. Existing rules must be interpreted and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us.\nIn management's opinion, the more significant reporting areas impacted by management's judgments and estimates are revenue recognition, asset impairments, goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes. Management's judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources, and actual results could differ from the estimates, as additional information becomes known. We believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies.\nRevenue recognition\nSales of clad metal products are generally based upon customer specifications set forth in customer purchase orders and require us to provide certifications relative to metals used, services performed and the results of any non-destructive testing that the customer has requested be performed. Issues of conformity of the product to specifications are resolved before the product is shipped and billed. Products related to the DynaEnergetics segment, which include detonating cords, detonators, bi-directional boosters and shaped charges, as well as seismic-related explosives and accessories, are standard in nature. In all cases, revenue is recognized only when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the price is fixed or determinable; delivery has occurred; and collection is reasonably assured.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.\nThe standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The standard can be adopted using either of two methods: (1) retrospective application to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients, as defined within the standard (\"full retrospective\") or (2) retrospective application with the cumulative effect of adoption recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures, as defined within the standard (\"modified retrospective\"). The Company will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach.\nIn preparation for adoption of the standard, the Company analyzed contracts from the NobelClad and DynaEnergetics segments to determine the technical accounting conclusions and the impact of the new revenue standard. In our NobelClad business, contracts are often for unique projects, but the vast majority of contracts contain standard terms and conditions. In our DynaEnergetics business, we sell a range of products to a wide variety of customers, but the contracts also often contain similar terms and conditions. We have reviewed NobelClad and DynaEnergetics revenue contracts and have concluded that applying the new standard will not have a material impact on our financial statements. The impact to our financial statements is not material because the analysis of our contracts under the new revenue recognition supports the recognition of revenue consistent with our current approach. Going forward, revenue on our contracts will continue to be recognized at the invoice price upon delivery to a customer because that is when our performance obligation is satisfied.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower-of-cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. Significant cost elements included in inventory are material, labor, freight, subcontract costs, and manufacturing overhead. As necessary, we record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory. To determine reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and values, and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements and technological developments.\nAsset impairments\nFinite-lived assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We compare the expected undiscounted future operating cash flows associated with these finite-lived assets to their respective carrying values to determine if they are fully recoverable when indicators of impairment are present. If the expected future operating cash flows of an asset are not sufficient to recover the carrying value, we estimate the fair value of the asset. Impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and when carrying value exceeds fair value. Long-lived assets to be disposed of, if any, are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nIn association with the 2015 and 2017 goodwill impairments, we tested finite-lived assets for impairment, and found that the carrying amounts of assets at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, in this case our reporting units, are fully recoverable.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. We allocate the total cost of the acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. As part of this allocation process, we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired. These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions regarding multiple, highly subjective variables, including those with respect to future cash flows, discount rates, asset lives, and the use of different valuation models, and therefore require considerable judgment. Our estimates and assumptions are based, in part, on the availability of listed market prices or other transparent market data. These determinations affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The carrying value of goodwill is periodically reviewed for impairment (at a minimum annually) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes in circumstances, many of which are subjective in nature, include significant negative industry or economic trends, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our strategy, a significant decrease in the market value of the asset, and a significant change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset.\nOur reporting units for goodwill impairment testing are currently the same as our reportable business segments: NobelClad and DynaEnergetics. Each business segment represents separately managed strategic business units, and our chief operating decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial results and evaluates operating performance at this level.\nGoodwill impairment testing is performed annually as of December 31. We utilize an income approach (discounted cash flow analysis) to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. We believe the discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of fair value for our reporting units. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flows for both reporting units include, among other measures, expected future sales, operating income, working capital and capital expenditures. Discount rates are determined using a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. Our approach also includes reviewing for reasonableness the total market capitalization of the Company as of December 31 to the sum of the discounted cash flows for the combined reporting units.\nAs required under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d, we routinely review the carrying value of our net assets, including goodwill, to determine if any impairment has occurred. At June 30, 2017, we conducted a quantitative assessment, at which time, based on existing conditions and management's outlook, we determined there was no impairment of NobelClad's goodwill. In the third quarter of 2017, activity in NobelClad's primary end markets slowed considerably. NobelClad experienced a significant decline in its small size core maintenance bookings within the oil and gas industry. Additionally, certain large petrochemical projects previously forecasted to ship in the next twelve months were delayed, and uncertainty existed as to the ultimate timing of booking and shipping these potential orders. As a result, we determined that a potential indicator of goodwill impairment existed during the third quarter of 2017. We utilized an income approach (discounted cash flow analysis) to determine the fair value of the NobelClad reporting unit and concluded that our long-term forecasts were not materializing and needed to be revised downward.\nWe determined that the estimated fair value of the NobelClad reporting unit was less than its carrying value primarily due to the factors described above and their related impact on expected future cash flows. During the third quarter, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2017-04 which amends and simplifies how an entity measures a goodwill impairment loss by eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. As the carrying value of the NobelClad reporting unit exceeded the fair value by more than the book value of goodwill, we recorded an impairment charge of $17,584 to fully impair the goodwill related to this reporting unit as of September 30, 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we observed a decrease in the market capitalization of the Company, thereby providing a potential indicator of impairment, which coincided with our 2015 annual goodwill impairment tests. As a result of our impairment testing, we found that the fair value of the DynaEnergetics reporting unit was less than its carrying value due primarily to the sustained decline in global oil prices, expected reduction in exploration and production activities of certain of our customers, and the impact these factors had on our expected future cash flows. We valued the assets of DynaEnergetics and, based on the results of that valuation, recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $11,464, representing the entire goodwill balance as of December 31, 2015. The NobelClad reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded carrying value by approximately 19%. No impairment of goodwill was identified in connection with our 2016 annual goodwill impairment tests.\nIncome taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Any effects of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment. The deferred income tax impact of tax credits are recognized as an immediate adjustment to income tax expense. We recognize deferred tax assets for the expected future effects of all deductible temporary differences to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. We record a valuation allowance when, based on current circumstances, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, recent financial operations and their associated valuation allowances, if any.\nWe recognize the tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate resolution. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in operating expense.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by SEC rules, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease refer to Note 2 \"Significant Accounting Policies\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their anticipated effect on our business.", "item_7_truncated": "Adjusted EBITDA declined due to the factors discussed above.

Our approach also includes reviewing for reasonableness the total market capitalization of the Company as of December 31 to the sum of the discounted cash flows for the combined reporting units.\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NobelClad\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>DynaEnergetics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>DMC Global Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Income (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,245\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,679\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 The size and timing of customer orders and shipments; \n \u2022 Our ability to manage periods of growth and contraction effectively; \nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COSTS AND EXPENSES:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and distribution expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of purchased intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(670\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,381\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>387\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>807\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur 2015 syndicated credit facility also includes various other covenants and restrictions, certain of which relate to the payment of dividends or other distributions to stockholders, redemption of capital stock, incurrence of additional indebtedness, mortgaging, and pledging or disposition of major assets.

Despite that, fabricator customers expect improved demand for long-delayed repair, maintenance and upgrade work. It appears higher energy prices and renewed enthusiasm for domestic infrastructure spending may pull forward a number of these projects, which we believe will lead to a recovery in bookings activity during 2018. In October 2017, NobelClad received a $7.4 million purchase order related to a petrochemical project in Asia, which is reflected in NobelClad's year-end backlog, and is expected to be shipped in the first half of 2018.

Our businesses operate through a global network of manufacturing, distribution and sales facilities. Our business is organized into two segments: NobelClad and DynaEnergetics.\nNet sales decreased compared with 2015 due to a 13% decrease in DynaEnergetics, which partially was offset by a 1% increase in NobelClad. The decline in DynaEnergetics was due to declining activity levels in the oil and gas well-completions sector and lower average selling prices. The increase in NobelClad primarily related to a large project for the semiconductor capital equipment industry that shipped in the second quarter of 2016.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,360\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of purchased intangibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn preparation for adoption of the standard, the Company analyzed contracts from the NobelClad and DynaEnergetics segments to determine the technical accounting conclusions and the impact of the new revenue standard. In our NobelClad business, contracts are often for unique projects, but the vast majority of contracts contain standard terms and conditions. In our DynaEnergetics business, we sell a range of products to a wide variety of customers, but the contracts also often contain similar terms and conditions. We have reviewed NobelClad and DynaEnergetics revenue contracts and have concluded that applying the new standard will not have a material impact on our financial statements. The impact to our financial statements is not material because the analysis of our contracts under the new revenue recognition supports the recognition of revenue consistent with our current approach. Going forward, revenue on our contracts will continue to be recognized at the invoice price upon delivery to a customer because that is when our performance obligation is satisfied.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COSTS AND EXPENSES:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and distribution expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of purchased intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,260\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,274\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,986\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(132\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,376\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,009\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(317\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,648\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,067\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(581\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>348\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,853\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,505\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,348\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(190\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe credit facility includes various covenants and restrictions, certain of which relate to the payment of dividends or other distributions to stockholders;

During the second quarter of 2016, NobelClad shipped a large project related to specialized explosion clad plates to be used in the fabrication of equipment for a semiconductor material production facility in East Asia.\n \u2022 The adequacy of local labor supplies at our facilities; \nSelling and distribution expenses increased compared with 2016 principally due to higher salaries and benefits and increased outside professional services partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense.\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities for 2017 totaled $647, which included net borrowings on bank lines of credit of $2,000, offset by payment of quarterly dividends of $1,174.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased compared with 2015 due to ongoing patent infringement and anti-dumping litigation costs and higher incentive compensation costs.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOperating loss decreased compared with 2015 due to the goodwill impairment at DynaEnergetics combined with the accrual for anti-dumping and countervailing duties in 2015.\nInterest income (expense), net increased compared with last year primarily due to expensing $261 of deferred debt issuance costs in conjunction with amending our credit facility in March 2017 combined with higher interest rates on a higher average outstanding line of credit balance.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\n \u2022 Fluctuations in customer demand; \nprices, and favorable product mix in DynaEnergetics. Corporate unallocated and stock-based compensation expenses are not allocated to our business segments.\nGeneral\nWe also maintain a line of credit with a German bank for certain European operations. This line of credit provides a borrowing capacity of 4,000 Euros.\nNobelClad\nGross profit increased compared with 2015 primarily due to the impact of a $6,205 accrual recorded in 2015 for anti-dumping and countervailing duties resulting from an unfavorable scope ruling from the Department of Commerce on prior imports of metals primarily used by DynaEnergetics for gun carrier tubing. Gross profit and gross profit percentage in 2016 were adversely affected by lower average selling prices in DynaEnergetics, a lower proportion of sales in DynaEnergetics relative to NobelClad, and the impact of higher research and development expenses in DynaEnergetics.\nSelling and distribution expenses decreased compared with 2015 principally due to lower outside sales agents commission expense driven by sales volume in territories in which we do not have an internal sales force, lower bad debt expense, and lower salaries and wages including the impact of closing distribution centers in 2015.\nOther income (expense), net in 2017 primarily was made up of realized and unrealized foreign currency losses. In 2016, other income (expense), net principally consisted of realized and unrealized foreign currency gains. Our subsidiaries frequently enter into inter-company and third party transactions that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. Changes in exchange rates with respect to these transactions will result in unrealized gains or losses if unsettled at the end of the reporting period or realized gains or losses at settlement of the transaction. During the third quarter of 2017, we began using foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities of one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated asset and liability positions. None of these contracts are designated as accounting hedges, and all changes in the fair value of the forward contracts are recognized immediately in \"Other income (expense), net\" within our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \u2022 Current or future limits on manufacturing capacity at our various operations; \nIncome taxes\n \u2022 The ability to remain an innovative leader in our fields of business; \nInventories are stated at the lower-of-cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. Significant cost elements included in inventory are material, labor, freight, subcontract costs, and manufacturing overhead. As necessary, we record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory. To determine reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and values, and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements and technological developments.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we observed a decrease in the market capitalization of the Company, thereby providing a potential indicator of impairment, which coincided with our 2015 annual goodwill impairment tests. As a result of our impairment testing, we found that the fair value of the DynaEnergetics reporting unit was less than its carrying value due primarily to the sustained decline in global oil prices, expected reduction in exploration and production activities of certain of our customers, and the impact these factors had on our expected future cash flows. We valued the assets of DynaEnergetics and, based on the results of that valuation, recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $11,464, representing the entire goodwill balance as of December 31, 2015. The NobelClad reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded carrying value by approximately 19%. No impairment of goodwill was identified in connection with our 2016 annual goodwill impairment tests.\nGross profit percentage increased compared with 2015 primarily due to improved margins on NobelClad's mix of projects during 2016. Gross profit also benefited from lower manufacturing overhead expenses from the consolidation of European manufacturing facilities.\nRestructuring expenses in 2016 related to severance for headcount reductions at DynaEnergetics' locations in Troisdorf, Germany and Austin, Texas, lease termination costs to exit administrative offices in Austin, Texas, costs related to relocation of perforating gun manufacturing operations in Germany, and the accelerated vesting of stock awards in connection with the elimination of certain positions. In 2015, restructuring expenses at NobelClad related to shifting of the majority of clad metal plate production from facilities in both Rivesaltes, France and W\u00fcrgendorf, Germany to the new manufacturing facility in Liebenscheid, Germany. DynaEnergetics restructuring expenses related to the consolidation of perforating gun manufacturing centers, the closure of distribution centers, and the reduction of the administrative workforce at the corporate offices in Troisdorf, Germany. Corporate restructuring expenses relate to the elimination of certain positions in our corporate office and the severance and expense related to the acceleration of unvested stock awards.\n\nfinancial measures are limited in their usefulness. Because not all companies use identical calculations, DMC's presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n \u2022 DynaEnergetics' sales of $121,253 in 2017 increased 80% compared with 2016 driven by a recovery in the North American unconventional well-completions sector and reflected increased well-stage counts; higher completion intensity and longer laterals; and increased market penetration of DynaEnergetics' perforating products and systems, including the DynaSelect detonator and the DynaStage system. \nThe debt service coverage ratio is defined in the 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, for any trailing four quarter period, as the ratio of (x) Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA for such period minus the sum of cash dividends, certain cash income taxes, and capital expenditures for such period to (y) the sum of cash interest expense for such period and scheduled principal payments of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness actually made during such period. The 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, required a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.35 to 1.0. The actual debt service coverage ratio for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2017, calculated in accordance with the 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, was 12.74 to 1.0.\nRevenue recognition\n\nITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn association with the 2015 and 2017 goodwill impairments, we tested finite-lived assets for impairment, and found that the carrying amounts of assets at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, in this case our reporting units, are fully recoverable.\nThe leverage ratio is defined in the 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, for any trailing four quarter period, as the ratio of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness (as defined in the agreement) on the last day of such period to Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA for such period. The maximum leverage ratio permitted by our 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, is 3.0 to 1.0. The actual leverage ratio as of December 31, 2017, calculated in accordance with the 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, was 0.82 to 1.0.\nRestructuring expenses in 2017 related to the announced closures of NobelClad's manufacturing facility in France and DynaEnergetics' sales and distribution operations in Kazakhstan. In 2016, restructuring expenses related to severance for headcount reductions at DynaEnergetics' Troisdorf, Germany and Austin, Texas locations, lease termination costs to exit administrative offices in Austin, Texas, costs related to the relocation of perforating gun manufacturing operations in Germany, and the accelerated vesting of stock awards in connection with the elimination of certain positions.\n\nOur diversified segments each provide a suite of unique technical products to niche sectors of the global energy, industrial and infrastructure markets, and each has established a strong or leading position in the markets in which it participates. With an underlying focus on generating free cash flow, our objective is to sustain and grow the market share of our businesses through increased market penetration, development of new applications, and research and development of new and adjacent products that can be sold across our global network of sales and distribution facilities. We routinely explore acquisitions of related businesses that could strengthen or add to our existing product portfolios, or expand our geographic footprint and market presence. We also seek acquisition opportunities outside our current markets that would complement our existing businesses and enable us to build a stronger and more diverse company.\nSales of clad metal products are generally based upon customer specifications set forth in customer purchase orders and require us to provide certifications relative to metals used, services performed and the results of any non-destructive testing that the customer has requested be performed. Issues of conformity of the product to specifications are resolved before the product is shipped and billed. Products related to the DynaEnergetics segment, which include detonating cords, detonators, bi-directional boosters and shaped charges, as well as seismic-related explosives and accessories, are standard in nature. In all cases, revenue is recognized only when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the price is fixed or determinable; delivery has occurred; and collection is reasonably assured.\nNet sales decreased compared with 2016 due to a decline in core repair and maintenance orders from the downstream energy industry and absence of large-project bookings in 2017. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2016, NobelClad shipped a large project related to specialized explosion clad plates used in the fabrication of equipment for a semiconductor material production facility in East Asia.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by SEC rules, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nOther contractual obligations and commitments\nOperating loss increased compared with 2016 due to the goodwill impairment charge and restructuring expenses combined with higher corporate unallocated and stock-based compensation expenses. The one-time impairment and restructuring charges and increased operating expenses partially were offset by increased sales volume, higher average selling\nInventories\nDynaEnergetics designs, manufactures and distributes products utilized by the global oil and gas industry principally for the perforation of oil and gas wells. These products are sold to oilfield service companies in the U.S., Europe, Canada, South America, Africa, the Middle East, Russia, and Asia. DynaEnergetics also sells directly to end-users. The market for perforating products, which are used during the well completion process, generally corresponds with oil and gas exploration and production activity. Exploration activity over the last several years has led to increasingly complex well completion operations, which in turn, has increased the demand for high quality and technically advanced perforating products.\nGoodwill impairment charge was recorded in 2017 to fully impair NobelClad's goodwill balance. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" for further discussion.\n(2) The operating lease obligations presented reflect future minimum lease payments due under non-cancelable portions of our leases as of December 31, 2017. Our operating lease obligations are described in Note 8 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities in 2017 totaled $6,184 and primarily consisted of acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $4,025 for DynaEnergetics and $1,584 for NobelClad.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased compared with 2015 primarily due to the factors discussed above. See \"Overview\" above for the explanation of the use of Adjusted EBITDA. The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe primarily evaluate performance and allocate resources based on segment revenues, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA as well as projected future performance. Segment operating income (loss) is defined as revenues less expenses identifiable to the segment. DMC operating income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA include unallocated corporate expenses and stock-based compensation expense, which are not allocated to our business segments. Segment operating income will reconcile to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes by deducting unallocated corporate expenses, including stock-based compensation, net other expense, net interest expense, and income tax provision (benefit).\nOperating loss was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge and the restructuring expenses combined with lower project volume and higher selling and distribution expenses.\n\n\nThe following items impacted the comparability of the company's results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nGross profit percentage increased compared with 2016 primarily due to higher average selling prices, improved product mix and the favorable impact of higher volume on fixed overhead expenses.\nOperating income increased compared with 2015 primarily due to higher gross profit from favorable project mix, lower general and administrative expenses and no restructuring charges in 2016.\n \u2022 In January 2018, DynaEnergetics announced the implementation of a global price increase applicable to all products. The increase varies by product line and generally ranges from 5% to 8%. Well completion activity is accelerating across DynaEnergetics' global markets, and as customers work to keep pace with the recovery, the business' advanced products and systems are enabling improved efficiencies, greater reliability and lower operating costs. \n \u2022 The ability to obtain new contracts at attractive prices; \nNet sales increased compared with 2016 primarily due to a recovery in North America's onshore unconventional drilling and completion market and increased market penetration of DynaEnergetics' initiating systems and DynaStage perforating system.\nThe table below presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates for our debt obligations and other contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017:\nRestructuring expense in 2016 related to severance for headcount reductions in Troisdorf, Germany and Austin, Texas and lease termination costs in Austin. Restructuring expense in 2015 related to the closure of a number of distribution centers in North America and Colombia and the closure of a perforating gun manufacturing facility and distribution center in Edmonton, Alberta.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) measure that we believe provides an important indicator of our ongoing operating performance and that we use in operational and financial decision-making. We define EBITDA as net income or loss plus or minus net interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes from EBITDA stock-based compensation, restructuring and impairment charges and, when appropriate, other items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC's operating performance (as further described in the tables below). As a result, internal management reports used during monthly operating reviews feature Adjusted EBITDA and certain management incentive awards are based, in part, on the amount of Adjusted EBITDA achieved during the year.\nSelling and distribution expenses increased compared with 2015 principally due to higher salaries and wages partially offset by a reduction of bad debt expense.\nDebt facilities\n \u2022 Fluctuations in foreign currencies. \nFinite-lived assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We compare the expected undiscounted future operating cash flows associated with these finite-lived assets to their respective carrying values to determine if they are fully recoverable when indicators of impairment are present. If the expected future operating cash flows of an asset are not sufficient to recover the carrying value, we estimate the fair value of the asset. Impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and when carrying value exceeds fair value. Long-lived assets to be disposed of, if any, are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities in 2015 totaled $5,326 and consisted of acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $3,668 for DynaEnergetics and $1,376 for NobelClad.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities in 2016 totaled $5,702 and primarily consisted of acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $4,448 for DynaEnergetics and $1,217 for NobelClad.\nSelling and distribution expenses increased compared with 2016 primarily from higher salaries and benefits due to increased investment in business growth resources and higher outside services expenses.\n\n \u2022 The price and availability of metal and other raw material; \nOperating loss declined compared to 2015 primarily due to the non-cash goodwill impairment charge and the accrual for anti-dumping and countervailing duties.\nGoodwill impairment charge in 2015 related to fully impairing DynaEnergetics' goodwill balance.\n \u2022 A goodwill impairment charge of $17,584 related to the NobelClad reporting unit was recorded in the third quarter of 2017 to reflect the decline in activity levels in NobelClad's primary end markets during the second half of the year. \nGeneral and administrative expenses increased compared with 2015 primarily due to higher outside legal expenses in DynaEnergetics due to patent infringement and anti-dumping litigation.\nWe account for our business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. We allocate the total cost of the acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. As part of this allocation process, we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired. These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions regarding multiple, highly subjective variables, including those with respect to future cash flows, discount rates, asset lives, and the use of different valuation models, and therefore require considerable judgment. Our estimates and assumptions are based, in part, on the availability of listed market prices or other transparent market data. These determinations affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain.\nNet loss in 2017 primarily was a result of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge and restructuring expenses and the other factors discussed above. Net loss in 2017 was $18,853, or $1.31 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $6,505, or $0.46 per diluted share in 2016.\n\nThe standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The standard can be adopted using either of two methods: (1) retrospective application to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients, as defined within the standard (\"full retrospective\") or (2) retrospective application with the cumulative effect of adoption recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures, as defined within the standard (\"modified retrospective\"). The Company will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach.\n\nAs required under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d, we routinely review the carrying value of our net assets, including goodwill, to determine if any impairment has occurred. At June 30, 2017, we conducted a quantitative assessment, at which time, based on existing conditions and management's outlook, we determined there was no impairment of NobelClad's goodwill. In the third quarter of 2017, activity in NobelClad's primary end markets slowed considerably. NobelClad experienced a significant decline in its small size core maintenance bookings within the oil and gas industry. Additionally, certain large petrochemical projects previously forecasted to ship in the next twelve months were delayed, and uncertainty existed as to the ultimate timing of booking and shipping these potential orders. As a result, we determined that a potential indicator of goodwill impairment existed during the third quarter of 2017. We utilized an income approach (discounted cash flow analysis) to determine the fair value of the NobelClad reporting unit and concluded that our long-term forecasts were not materializing and needed to be revised downward.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The carrying value of goodwill is periodically reviewed for impairment (at a minimum annually) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes in circumstances, many of which are subjective in nature, include significant negative industry or economic trends, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our strategy, a significant decrease in the market value of the asset, and a significant change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $6,747 in 2017 compared with $18,198 for 2016. The decline primarily was due to increased net working capital requirements from higher sales and tendering $3,049 in AD/CVD amounts to U.S. Customs in March 2017 pending ultimate resolution of the AD/CVD case.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 The timing and size of expenditures; \nNet sales increased compared with 2016 due to an 80% increase in DynaEnergetics' net sales driven by a recovery in the North American unconventional well-completions sector and reflected increased well-stage counts; higher completion intensity and longer laterals; and increased market penetration of DynaEnergetics' perforating products and systems. The increase in DynaEnergetics' net sales partially was offset by a 22% decline in NobelClad's net sales as weak capital spending in NobelClad's industrial infrastructure and energy markets resulted in a decline in core repair and maintenance work and the absence of large projects.\n \u2022 General economic conditions, both domestic and foreign, impacting our business and the business of the end-market users we serve; \n \u2022 Consolidated gross profit of 31% in 2017 increased from 25% in 2016. The improvement primarily related to a higher proportion of DynaEnergetics sales relative to NobelClad sales, combined with higher average selling prices as well as improved product mix in DynaEnergetics. \n(4) Amounts represent commitments to purchase goods or services to be utilized in the normal course of business. These amounts are not reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nGeneral and administrative expenses declined compared with 2015 primarily due to lower salaries and wages and outside service costs.\nAs of December 31, 2017, U.S. dollar revolving loans of $18,250 were outstanding under our 2015 syndicated credit facility and our available borrowing capacity was approximately $16,750.\n\nPlease refer to Note 2 \"Significant Accounting Policies\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their anticipated effect on our business.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet sales decreased compared with 2015 due to lower volume and average selling prices resulting from the lower demand for well completions in the oil and gas sector.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nSelling and distribution expenses decreased compared with 2015 principally due to lower salaries and benefits, a reduction in bad debt expense, and lower outside sales agent commissions in DynaEnergetics driven by sales volume in territories in which we do not have an internal sales team.\n \u2022 The impacts of pending or future litigation or regulatory matters; \nIncome tax provision of $3,569 for 2017 compared with an income tax provision of $797 for 2016. The current-year income tax provision included $946 of which was a transition tax related to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"). The transition tax is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. To determine the amount of the transition tax, we must determine, among other things, the amount of post-1986 E&P of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. We made a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and recorded a provisional transition tax obligation of $946, of which $871 is recorded in other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, we continue to gather additional information to compute more precisely the post-1986 E&P and related non-U.S. income taxes paid. The TCJA's transition tax is payable over eight years beginning in 2018. Upon completion of the analysis of post-1986 E&P and related non-U.S. income taxes paid, revisions to our transition tax obligation, if necessary, will be recorded in the 2018 tax provision. Additionally, we currently are unable to recognize tax benefits associated with losses incurred in certain jurisdictions due to valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions.\n \u2022 Product pricing and margins; \nWe have historically financed our operations from a combination of internally generated cash flow, revolving credit borrowings, and various long-term debt arrangements. We believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our current credit facilities and any future replacement thereof will be sufficient to fund the working capital, debt service, dividends, announced expansion plans for DynaEnergetics as well as other capital expenditure requirements of our current business operations for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations will depend upon our success in executing our strategies. If we are unable to (i) realize sales from our backlog; (ii) secure new customer orders; (iii) continue selling products at attractive margins; and (iv) continue to implement cost-effective internal processes, our ability to meet cash requirements through operating activities could be impacted. Also, continued heightened litigation costs or unfavorable court decisions in ongoing patent infringement litigation or anti-dumping and countervailing duties (\"AD/CVD\") matters could negatively impact our ability to meet future cash requirements. Furthermore, any restriction on the availability of borrowings under our credit facilities could negatively affect our ability to meet future cash requirements. In March 2017, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been declared effective, and on which we registered for sale up to $150 million of certain of our securities from time to time and on terms that we may determine in the future. Our ability to access this capital may be limited by market conditions at the time of any future potential offering. There can be no assurance that any such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nGross profit percentage increased compared with 2016 primarily due to better margins on the mix of projects in the current year.\nBusiness Combinations\nAdjusted EBITDA declined due to the factors discussed above. See \"Overview\" above for the explanation of the use of Adjusted EBITDA. The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA.\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities for 2015 totaled $1,788, which included net borrowings on bank lines of credit of $5,003, payment of quarterly dividends of $2,260, and payment of deferred debt issuance costs of $1,222.\n \u2022 The timely completion of contracts; \n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nForward-Looking Statements\nGoodwill impairment charge in 2015 was to fully write off goodwill related to the DynaEnergetics segment. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" for further discussion.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities for 2016 totaled $12,107, which included net repayments on bank lines of credit of $11,250 and payment of quarterly dividends of $1,150.\nThese forward-looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include those relating to:\n(1) Represents outstanding borrowings under our U.S. dollar revolving line of credit. For more information about our debt obligations, see Note 3 \"Debt\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBusiness Segment Financial Information\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Any effects of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment. The deferred income tax impact of tax credits are recognized as an immediate adjustment to income tax expense. We recognize deferred tax assets for the expected future effects of all deductible temporary differences to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. We record a valuation allowance when, based on current circumstances, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, recent financial operations and their associated valuation allowances, if any.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n\nAsset impairments\nGoodwill impairment charge related to fully impairing NobelClad's goodwill balance.\n(3) The license agreements obligations presented reflect future minimum payments due under non-cancelable portions of our agreements as of December 31, 2017. Our license agreements obligations are described in Note 8 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThis annual report and the documents incorporated by reference into it contain certain forward-looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigations Reform Act of 1995. Words such as anticipates,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d plans,\u201d believes,\u201d seeks,\u201d estimates,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d continue,\u201d project,\u201d forecast,\u201d and similar expressions, as well as statements in the future tense, identify forward-looking statements. Such statements include projections, guidance and other statements regarding our future expected financial position and operating results, our growth and business strategy, our expectations regarding the oil and gas industry, the timing and costs of our Blum, Texas and other expansion plans, our plans to consolidate NobelClad's European production facilities, including the timing and costs involved in closing manufacturing operations in France, our expectations regarding NobelClad's sales, bookings, and backlog in 2018, impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our financing plans, our future liquidity position and factors impacting such position, and the outcome of the pending GEODynamics and anti-dumping matters.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical Consolidated Financial Statements and notes, as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this annual report.\nNet Debt is a non-GAAP measure we use to supplement information in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We define net debt as lines of credit less cash and cash equivalents. In addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses this information to evaluate its performance, and we believe that certain investors may do the same.\nGross profit percentage increased compared with 2015 primarily due to the impact of a $6,205 accrual recorded in 2015 for anti-dumping and countervailing duties and favorable product mix in 2016 partially offset by lower average selling prices and higher research and development expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased due to the factors discussed above. See \"Overview\" above for the explanation of the use of Adjusted EBITDA. The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA.\nCash flows from investing activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the net sales, segment operating income or loss, and Adjusted EBITDA for each segment was as follows:\nIn management's opinion, the more significant reporting areas impacted by management's judgments and estimates are revenue recognition, asset impairments, goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes. Management's judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources, and actual results could differ from the estimates, as additional information becomes known. We believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies.\n\nOverview\nWe determined that the estimated fair value of the NobelClad reporting unit was less than its carrying value primarily due to the factors described above and their related impact on expected future cash flows. During the third quarter, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2017-04 which amends and simplifies how an entity measures a goodwill impairment loss by eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. As the carrying value of the NobelClad reporting unit exceeded the fair value by more than the book value of goodwill, we recorded an impairment charge of $17,584 to fully impair the goodwill related to this reporting unit as of September 30, 2017.\nCash flows from financing activities\nOn March 8, 2018, we entered into a five-year $75,000 syndicated credit agreement ( credit facility\u201d) which replaced in its entirety our prior syndicated credit facility entered into on February 23, 2015. The new credit facility allows for revolving loans of up to $50,000 with a $20,000 US dollar equivalent sublimit for alternative currency loans. In addition, the new agreement provides for a $25,000 Capital Expenditure Facility ( Capex Facility)\u201d which is to be used to finance our DynaEnergetics manufacturing expansion project in Blum, Texas. The Capex facility allows for advances to fund capital expenditures of the Blum expansion project during year one of the credit facility. At the end of year one, the Capex Facility will convert to a term loan which will be amortizable at 12.5% of principal per year with a balloon payment for the outstanding balance upon the credit facility maturity date in year five. The new facility has a $100,000 accordion feature to increase the commitments under the revolving loan class and/or by adding a term loan subject to approval by applicable lenders. We entered into the credit facility with a syndicate of three banks, with KeyBank, N.A. acting as administrative agent. The syndicated credit facility is secured by the assets of DMC including accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets, as well as guarantees and share pledges by DMC and its subsidiaries.\n\nSelling and distribution expenses increased compared with 2016 primarily due to higher salaries and wages and higher outside service costs, partially offset by lower bad debt expense.\nBorrowings under the $20,000 Alternate Currency sublimit can be in Euros, Canadian dollars, Pounds sterling, and in any other currency acceptable to the administrative agent. Alternative currency borrowings denominated in Euros, Pounds sterling, and any other currency that is dealt with on the London Interbank Deposit Market shall be comprised of LIBOR loans and bear interest at the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin (varying from 1.50% to 3.00%).\n \u2022 Our ability to realize sales from our backlog and our ability to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain; \n \u2022 Consolidated selling, general, and administrative expenses were $45,724 in 2017 compared with $38,741 in 2016. The increase primarily was due to higher patent litigation expenses at DynaEnergetics and increased salaries and wages from headcount additions and higher variable incentive compensation expense. \n \u2022 NobelClad's sales of $71,550 in 2017 decreased 22% compared with 2016 as weak capital spending in NobelClad's industrial infrastructure and energy markets resulted in a decline in core repair and maintenance work and the absence of large projects. \nGeneral and administrative expenses increased compared with 2016 primarily due to higher outside legal expenses related to patent infringement defense costs in DynaEnergetics, higher salaries and wages from headcount additions and increased variable incentive compensation, and higher stock-based compensation expense.\nGoodwill\n \u2022 The application of governmental regulation and oversight of our operations and products and the industries in which our customers operate; \nCash flows from operating activities\n \u2022 The timely receipt of government approvals and permits; \n \u2022 Restructuring expenses of $4,283 in 2017 were related to the planned closure of NobelClad's manufacturing operations in France and the closure of DynaEnergetics' sales and distribution facility in Kazakhstan. Restructuring expenses of $1,202 in 2016 primarily related to severance for headcount reductions and lease termination costs at DynaEnergetics. \nUnless stated otherwise, all dollar figures in this report are presented in thousands (000s). N/M indicates that the change in dollars or percentage was not meaningful.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNobelClad is a global leader in the production of explosion-welded clad metal plates for use in the construction of corrosion resistant industrial processing equipment and specialized transition joints. While a significant portion of the demand for our clad metal products is driven by maintenance and retrofit projects at existing chemical processing, petrochemical processing, oil refining, and aluminum smelting facilities, new plant construction and large plant expansion projects also account for a significant portion of total demand. These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and timing of new order inflow remains difficult to predict. We use backlog as a primary means to measure the immediate outlook for our NobelClad business. We define backlog\u201d at any given point in time as all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time. Most firm purchase orders and commitments are realized, and we expect to fill most backlog orders within the following 12 months. NobelClad's backlog increased to $37,529 at December 31, 2017 from $31,634 at December 31, 2016.\n\nBorrowings under the $50,000 revolving loan and $25,000 Capex term loan can be in the form of one, two, three, or six month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) loans. Additionally, US dollar borrowings on the revolving loan can be in the form of Base Rate loans (Base Rate borrowings are based on the greater of the administrative agent's Prime rates, an adjusted Federal Funds rates or an adjusted LIBOR rate). LIBOR loans bear interest at the applicable LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin (varying from 1.50% to 3.00%). Base Rate loans bear interest at the defined Base rate plus an applicable margin (varying from 0.50% to 2.00%).\nAdjusted EBITDA increased compared with 2016 primarily due to the factors discussed above. See \"Overview\" above for the explanation of the use of Adjusted EBITDA. The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA.\nNobelClad\nRestructuring expenses in 2015 related to shifting the majority of clad metal plate production from facilities in both Rivesaltes, France and W\u00fcrgendorf, Germany to the new manufacturing facility in Liebenscheid, Germany.\nOur historical Consolidated Financial Statements and notes to our historical Consolidated Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that our management make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. However, the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity. Existing rules must be interpreted and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us.\nCost of products sold for DynaEnergetics includes the cost of metals, explosives and other raw materials used to manufacture shaped charges, detonating products and perforating guns as well as employee compensation and benefits, depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment, manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses.\nThe presence of non-GAAP financial measures in this report is not intended to suggest that such measures be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or as superior to, DMC's GAAP information, and investors are cautioned that the non-GAAP\n \u2022 Competitive factors; \nThe effects of these factors are difficult to predict. New factors emerge from time to time and we cannot assess the potential impact of any such factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this annual report, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In addition, see Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of these and other factors that could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased compared with 2016 primarily due to higher outside legal expenses related to patent infringement defense costs and higher salaries and wages from headcount additions and variable incentive compensation expense.\nOperating income was $15,470 in 2017 compared to an operating loss of $5,380 in 2016 due to higher unit volume, favorable product mix and higher average selling prices, partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses.\n \u2022 Our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses; \n \u2022 To address the accelerating demand for its perforating systems, in December 2017, DynaEnergetics commenced construction of a new 74,000 square foot manufacturing, assembly and administrative space on its manufacturing campus in Blum, Texas. The facility, which is scheduled to open during the third quarter of 2018, will substantially increase DynaEnergetics' component manufacturing and DynaStage assembly capacity. During the first half of 2018, DynaEnergetics plans to add a second automated DynaSelect detonator line at its facility in Troisdorf, Germany. In the second half of 2018, the business plans to add a second automated shaped-charge manufacturing line at Blum, which will more than double its shaped charge production capacity in the U.S. \nWe declared and paid quarterly dividends aggregating $0.08 per share in 2017 and $0.08 per share in 2016. We may pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Future dividends may be affected by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements, future business prospects, debt covenant compliance considerations, changes in income tax laws, and any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Any determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors.\nDynaEnergetics\nNet loss in 2016 was $6,505, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $23,971, or $1.72 per diluted share, in 2015.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIncome tax provision of $797 for 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of $2,118 for 2015. We were unable to recognize tax benefits associated with losses incurred in certain jurisdictions due to valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions.", "item_7_text": "Adjusted EBITDA declined due to the factors discussed above. See \"Overview\" above for the explanation of the use of Adjusted EBITDA. The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased compared with 2016 primarily due to the factors discussed above. See \"Overview\" above for the explanation of the use of Adjusted EBITDA. The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA.\nGoodwill impairment testing is performed annually as of December 31. We utilize an income approach (discounted cash flow analysis) to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. We believe the discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of fair value for our reporting units. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flows for both reporting units include, among other measures, expected future sales, operating income, working capital and capital expenditures. Discount rates are determined using a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. Our approach also includes reviewing for reasonableness the total market capitalization of the Company as of December 31 to the sum of the discounted cash flows for the combined reporting units.\n \u2022 The size and timing of customer orders and shipments; \n \u2022 Our ability to manage periods of growth and contraction effectively; \nOur 2015 syndicated credit facility also includes various other covenants and restrictions, certain of which relate to the payment of dividends or other distributions to stockholders, redemption of capital stock, incurrence of additional indebtedness, mortgaging, and pledging or disposition of major assets. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of our credit facilities.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.\nInterest income (expense), net decreased compared with 2015 primarily due to writing off $508 of deferred debt issuance costs in December 2015 after entering into a credit facility amendment. Interest expense on our lines of credit was lower in 2016 from lower interest on a smaller average outstanding balance, partially offset by higher interest on the accrued anti-dumping and countervailing duties in DynaEnergetics.\nBusiness Outlook\n \u2022 The recent decline in NobelClad's core repair and maintenance orders from the downstream energy industry has continued in the first quarter of 2018. Despite that, fabricator customers expect improved demand for long-delayed repair, maintenance and upgrade work. It appears higher energy prices and renewed enthusiasm for domestic infrastructure spending may pull forward a number of these projects, which we believe will lead to a recovery in bookings activity during 2018. In October 2017, NobelClad received a $7.4 million purchase order related to a petrochemical project in Asia, which is reflected in NobelClad's year-end backlog, and is expected to be shipped in the first half of 2018. The order is the largest booked by NobelClad in more than four years. \nOur reporting units for goodwill impairment testing are currently the same as our reportable business segments: NobelClad and DynaEnergetics. Each business segment represents separately managed strategic business units, and our chief operating decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial results and evaluates operating performance at this level.\nGross profit percentage increased compared with 2016 primarily due to higher average selling prices and improved product mix in DynaEnergetics and better project mix in NobelClad.\nRestructuring expense related to the announced closure of NobelClad's manufacturing facility in France.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nDMC operates a diversified family of technical product and process businesses serving the energy, industrial and infrastructure markets. Our businesses operate through a global network of manufacturing, distribution and sales facilities. Our business is organized into two segments: NobelClad and DynaEnergetics.\nNet sales decreased compared with 2015 due to a 13% decrease in DynaEnergetics, which partially was offset by a 1% increase in NobelClad. The decline in DynaEnergetics was due to declining activity levels in the oil and gas well-completions sector and lower average selling prices. The increase in NobelClad primarily related to a large project for the semiconductor capital equipment industry that shipped in the second quarter of 2016.\nIn preparation for adoption of the standard, the Company analyzed contracts from the NobelClad and DynaEnergetics segments to determine the technical accounting conclusions and the impact of the new revenue standard. In our NobelClad business, contracts are often for unique projects, but the vast majority of contracts contain standard terms and conditions. In our DynaEnergetics business, we sell a range of products to a wide variety of customers, but the contracts also often contain similar terms and conditions. We have reviewed NobelClad and DynaEnergetics revenue contracts and have concluded that applying the new standard will not have a material impact on our financial statements. The impact to our financial statements is not material because the analysis of our contracts under the new revenue recognition supports the recognition of revenue consistent with our current approach. Going forward, revenue on our contracts will continue to be recognized at the invoice price upon delivery to a customer because that is when our performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe credit facility includes various covenants and restrictions, certain of which relate to the payment of dividends or other distributions to stockholders; redemption of capital stock; incurrence of additional indebtedness; mortgaging, pledging or disposition of major assets; and maintenance of specified ratios.\n \u2022 Changes in global economic conditions; \nNet cash provided by operating activities was $18,198 in 2016 compared to $1,618 in 2015. The year-over-year increase of $16,580 was driven by an improvement in net working capital. We experienced favorable net working capital changes of $10,081 in 2016 compared to unfavorable changes in net working capital of $3,068 in 2015. Favorable changes in our 2016 net working capital included decreases of $6,829, $2,679 and $1,002 in inventory, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses, respectively, and decreases of $510 and $223 in accrued expenses and other liabilities and in customer advances. The favorable working capital changes partially were offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $1,338.\n \u2022 Net debt of $9,001 (comprised of $17,984 indebtedness net of $8,983 in cash) decreased 3% from December 31, 2016. Net debt, a non-GAAP measure, is calculated as amounts borrowed under lines of credit less cash and cash equivalents. \nDynaEnergetics\nFactors Affecting Results\nWe recognize the tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate resolution. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in operating expense.\nOther income (expense), net in 2016 principally consisted of realized and unrealized foreign currency gains. In 2015, other income (expense), net principally consisted of realized and unrealized foreign currency losses. Our subsidiaries frequently enter into inter-company and third party transactions that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. Changes in exchange rates with respect to these transactions will result in unrealized gains or losses if unsettled at the end of the reporting period or realized gains or losses at settlement of the transaction.\n \u2022 The availability and cost of funds; and \nRestructuring expense in 2017 related to the closure of operations in Kazakhstan. Restructuring activity in 2016 related to severance for headcount reductions in Troisdorf, Germany and Austin, Texas and the accelerated vesting of stock awards in connection with the elimination of certain positions.\nNet sales increased compared with 2015 primarily due to timing differences with respect to when orders entered our backlog and the subsequent shipment of these orders. During the second quarter of 2016, NobelClad shipped a large project related to specialized explosion clad plates to be used in the fabrication of equipment for a semiconductor material production facility in East Asia.\n \u2022 The adequacy of local labor supplies at our facilities; \nSelling and distribution expenses increased compared with 2016 principally due to higher salaries and benefits and increased outside professional services partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense.\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities for 2017 totaled $647, which included net borrowings on bank lines of credit of $2,000, offset by payment of quarterly dividends of $1,174.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased compared with 2015 due to ongoing patent infringement and anti-dumping litigation costs and higher incentive compensation costs.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nOperating loss decreased compared with 2015 due to the goodwill impairment at DynaEnergetics combined with the accrual for anti-dumping and countervailing duties in 2015.\nInterest income (expense), net increased compared with last year primarily due to expensing $261 of deferred debt issuance costs in conjunction with amending our credit facility in March 2017 combined with higher interest rates on a higher average outstanding line of credit balance.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\n \u2022 Fluctuations in customer demand; \nprices, and favorable product mix in DynaEnergetics. Corporate unallocated and stock-based compensation expenses are not allocated to our business segments.\nGeneral\nWe also maintain a line of credit with a German bank for certain European operations. This line of credit provides a borrowing capacity of 4,000 Euros.\nNobelClad\nGross profit increased compared with 2015 primarily due to the impact of a $6,205 accrual recorded in 2015 for anti-dumping and countervailing duties resulting from an unfavorable scope ruling from the Department of Commerce on prior imports of metals primarily used by DynaEnergetics for gun carrier tubing. Gross profit and gross profit percentage in 2016 were adversely affected by lower average selling prices in DynaEnergetics, a lower proportion of sales in DynaEnergetics relative to NobelClad, and the impact of higher research and development expenses in DynaEnergetics.\nSelling and distribution expenses decreased compared with 2015 principally due to lower outside sales agents commission expense driven by sales volume in territories in which we do not have an internal sales force, lower bad debt expense, and lower salaries and wages including the impact of closing distribution centers in 2015.\nOther income (expense), net in 2017 primarily was made up of realized and unrealized foreign currency losses. In 2016, other income (expense), net principally consisted of realized and unrealized foreign currency gains. Our subsidiaries frequently enter into inter-company and third party transactions that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. Changes in exchange rates with respect to these transactions will result in unrealized gains or losses if unsettled at the end of the reporting period or realized gains or losses at settlement of the transaction. During the third quarter of 2017, we began using foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities of one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated asset and liability positions. None of these contracts are designated as accounting hedges, and all changes in the fair value of the forward contracts are recognized immediately in \"Other income (expense), net\" within our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \u2022 Current or future limits on manufacturing capacity at our various operations; \nIncome taxes\n \u2022 The ability to remain an innovative leader in our fields of business; \nInventories are stated at the lower-of-cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. Significant cost elements included in inventory are material, labor, freight, subcontract costs, and manufacturing overhead. As necessary, we record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory. To determine reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and values, and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements and technological developments.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we observed a decrease in the market capitalization of the Company, thereby providing a potential indicator of impairment, which coincided with our 2015 annual goodwill impairment tests. As a result of our impairment testing, we found that the fair value of the DynaEnergetics reporting unit was less than its carrying value due primarily to the sustained decline in global oil prices, expected reduction in exploration and production activities of certain of our customers, and the impact these factors had on our expected future cash flows. We valued the assets of DynaEnergetics and, based on the results of that valuation, recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $11,464, representing the entire goodwill balance as of December 31, 2015. The NobelClad reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded carrying value by approximately 19%. No impairment of goodwill was identified in connection with our 2016 annual goodwill impairment tests.\nGross profit percentage increased compared with 2015 primarily due to improved margins on NobelClad's mix of projects during 2016. Gross profit also benefited from lower manufacturing overhead expenses from the consolidation of European manufacturing facilities.\nRestructuring expenses in 2016 related to severance for headcount reductions at DynaEnergetics' locations in Troisdorf, Germany and Austin, Texas, lease termination costs to exit administrative offices in Austin, Texas, costs related to relocation of perforating gun manufacturing operations in Germany, and the accelerated vesting of stock awards in connection with the elimination of certain positions. In 2015, restructuring expenses at NobelClad related to shifting of the majority of clad metal plate production from facilities in both Rivesaltes, France and W\u00fcrgendorf, Germany to the new manufacturing facility in Liebenscheid, Germany. DynaEnergetics restructuring expenses related to the consolidation of perforating gun manufacturing centers, the closure of distribution centers, and the reduction of the administrative workforce at the corporate offices in Troisdorf, Germany. Corporate restructuring expenses relate to the elimination of certain positions in our corporate office and the severance and expense related to the acceleration of unvested stock awards.\n\nfinancial measures are limited in their usefulness. Because not all companies use identical calculations, DMC's presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n \u2022 DynaEnergetics' sales of $121,253 in 2017 increased 80% compared with 2016 driven by a recovery in the North American unconventional well-completions sector and reflected increased well-stage counts; higher completion intensity and longer laterals; and increased market penetration of DynaEnergetics' perforating products and systems, including the DynaSelect detonator and the DynaStage system. \nThe debt service coverage ratio is defined in the 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, for any trailing four quarter period, as the ratio of (x) Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA for such period minus the sum of cash dividends, certain cash income taxes, and capital expenditures for such period to (y) the sum of cash interest expense for such period and scheduled principal payments of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness actually made during such period. The 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, required a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.35 to 1.0. The actual debt service coverage ratio for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2017, calculated in accordance with the 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, was 12.74 to 1.0.\nRevenue recognition\n\nITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn association with the 2015 and 2017 goodwill impairments, we tested finite-lived assets for impairment, and found that the carrying amounts of assets at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, in this case our reporting units, are fully recoverable.\nThe leverage ratio is defined in the 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, for any trailing four quarter period, as the ratio of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness (as defined in the agreement) on the last day of such period to Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA for such period. The maximum leverage ratio permitted by our 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, is 3.0 to 1.0. The actual leverage ratio as of December 31, 2017, calculated in accordance with the 2015 syndicated credit facility, as amended, was 0.82 to 1.0.\nRestructuring expenses in 2017 related to the announced closures of NobelClad's manufacturing facility in France and DynaEnergetics' sales and distribution operations in Kazakhstan. In 2016, restructuring expenses related to severance for headcount reductions at DynaEnergetics' Troisdorf, Germany and Austin, Texas locations, lease termination costs to exit administrative offices in Austin, Texas, costs related to the relocation of perforating gun manufacturing operations in Germany, and the accelerated vesting of stock awards in connection with the elimination of certain positions.\n\nOur diversified segments each provide a suite of unique technical products to niche sectors of the global energy, industrial and infrastructure markets, and each has established a strong or leading position in the markets in which it participates. With an underlying focus on generating free cash flow, our objective is to sustain and grow the market share of our businesses through increased market penetration, development of new applications, and research and development of new and adjacent products that can be sold across our global network of sales and distribution facilities. We routinely explore acquisitions of related businesses that could strengthen or add to our existing product portfolios, or expand our geographic footprint and market presence. We also seek acquisition opportunities outside our current markets that would complement our existing businesses and enable us to build a stronger and more diverse company.\nSales of clad metal products are generally based upon customer specifications set forth in customer purchase orders and require us to provide certifications relative to metals used, services performed and the results of any non-destructive testing that the customer has requested be performed. Issues of conformity of the product to specifications are resolved before the product is shipped and billed. Products related to the DynaEnergetics segment, which include detonating cords, detonators, bi-directional boosters and shaped charges, as well as seismic-related explosives and accessories, are standard in nature. In all cases, revenue is recognized only when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the price is fixed or determinable; delivery has occurred; and collection is reasonably assured.\nNet sales decreased compared with 2016 due to a decline in core repair and maintenance orders from the downstream energy industry and absence of large-project bookings in 2017. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2016, NobelClad shipped a large project related to specialized explosion clad plates used in the fabrication of equipment for a semiconductor material production facility in East Asia.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by SEC rules, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nOther contractual obligations and commitments\nOperating loss increased compared with 2016 due to the goodwill impairment charge and restructuring expenses combined with higher corporate unallocated and stock-based compensation expenses. The one-time impairment and restructuring charges and increased operating expenses partially were offset by increased sales volume, higher average selling\nInventories\nDynaEnergetics designs, manufactures and distributes products utilized by the global oil and gas industry principally for the perforation of oil and gas wells. These products are sold to oilfield service companies in the U.S., Europe, Canada, South America, Africa, the Middle East, Russia, and Asia. DynaEnergetics also sells directly to end-users. The market for perforating products, which are used during the well completion process, generally corresponds with oil and gas exploration and production activity. Exploration activity over the last several years has led to increasingly complex well completion operations, which in turn, has increased the demand for high quality and technically advanced perforating products.\nGoodwill impairment charge was recorded in 2017 to fully impair NobelClad's goodwill balance. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" for further discussion.\n(2) The operating lease obligations presented reflect future minimum lease payments due under non-cancelable portions of our leases as of December 31, 2017. Our operating lease obligations are described in Note 8 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities in 2017 totaled $6,184 and primarily consisted of acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $4,025 for DynaEnergetics and $1,584 for NobelClad.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased compared with 2015 primarily due to the factors discussed above. See \"Overview\" above for the explanation of the use of Adjusted EBITDA. The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe primarily evaluate performance and allocate resources based on segment revenues, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA as well as projected future performance. Segment operating income (loss) is defined as revenues less expenses identifiable to the segment. DMC operating income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA include unallocated corporate expenses and stock-based compensation expense, which are not allocated to our business segments. Segment operating income will reconcile to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes by deducting unallocated corporate expenses, including stock-based compensation, net other expense, net interest expense, and income tax provision (benefit).\nOperating loss was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge and the restructuring expenses combined with lower project volume and higher selling and distribution expenses.\n\n\nThe following items impacted the comparability of the company's results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nGross profit percentage increased compared with 2016 primarily due to higher average selling prices, improved product mix and the favorable impact of higher volume on fixed overhead expenses.\nOperating income increased compared with 2015 primarily due to higher gross profit from favorable project mix, lower general and administrative expenses and no restructuring charges in 2016.\n \u2022 In January 2018, DynaEnergetics announced the implementation of a global price increase applicable to all products. The increase varies by product line and generally ranges from 5% to 8%. Well completion activity is accelerating across DynaEnergetics' global markets, and as customers work to keep pace with the recovery, the business' advanced products and systems are enabling improved efficiencies, greater reliability and lower operating costs. \n \u2022 The ability to obtain new contracts at attractive prices; \nNet sales increased compared with 2016 primarily due to a recovery in North America's onshore unconventional drilling and completion market and increased market penetration of DynaEnergetics' initiating systems and DynaStage perforating system.\nThe table below presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates for our debt obligations and other contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017:\nRestructuring expense in 2016 related to severance for headcount reductions in Troisdorf, Germany and Austin, Texas and lease termination costs in Austin. Restructuring expense in 2015 related to the closure of a number of distribution centers in North America and Colombia and the closure of a perforating gun manufacturing facility and distribution center in Edmonton, Alberta.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) measure that we believe provides an important indicator of our ongoing operating performance and that we use in operational and financial decision-making. We define EBITDA as net income or loss plus or minus net interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes from EBITDA stock-based compensation, restructuring and impairment charges and, when appropriate, other items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC's operating performance (as further described in the tables below). As a result, internal management reports used during monthly operating reviews feature Adjusted EBITDA and certain management incentive awards are based, in part, on the amount of Adjusted EBITDA achieved during the year.\nSelling and distribution expenses increased compared with 2015 principally due to higher salaries and wages partially offset by a reduction of bad debt expense.\nDebt facilities\n \u2022 Fluctuations in foreign currencies. \nFinite-lived assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We compare the expected undiscounted future operating cash flows associated with these finite-lived assets to their respective carrying values to determine if they are fully recoverable when indicators of impairment are present. If the expected future operating cash flows of an asset are not sufficient to recover the carrying value, we estimate the fair value of the asset. Impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and when carrying value exceeds fair value. Long-lived assets to be disposed of, if any, are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities in 2015 totaled $5,326 and consisted of acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $3,668 for DynaEnergetics and $1,376 for NobelClad.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities in 2016 totaled $5,702 and primarily consisted of acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $4,448 for DynaEnergetics and $1,217 for NobelClad.\nSelling and distribution expenses increased compared with 2016 primarily from higher salaries and benefits due to increased investment in business growth resources and higher outside services expenses.\n\n \u2022 The price and availability of metal and other raw material; \nOperating loss declined compared to 2015 primarily due to the non-cash goodwill impairment charge and the accrual for anti-dumping and countervailing duties.\nGoodwill impairment charge in 2015 related to fully impairing DynaEnergetics' goodwill balance.\n \u2022 A goodwill impairment charge of $17,584 related to the NobelClad reporting unit was recorded in the third quarter of 2017 to reflect the decline in activity levels in NobelClad's primary end markets during the second half of the year. \nGeneral and administrative expenses increased compared with 2015 primarily due to higher outside legal expenses in DynaEnergetics due to patent infringement and anti-dumping litigation.\nWe account for our business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. We allocate the total cost of the acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. As part of this allocation process, we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired. These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions regarding multiple, highly subjective variables, including those with respect to future cash flows, discount rates, asset lives, and the use of different valuation models, and therefore require considerable judgment. Our estimates and assumptions are based, in part, on the availability of listed market prices or other transparent market data. These determinations affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain.\nNet loss in 2017 primarily was a result of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge and restructuring expenses and the other factors discussed above. Net loss in 2017 was $18,853, or $1.31 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $6,505, or $0.46 per diluted share in 2016.\n\nThe standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The standard can be adopted using either of two methods: (1) retrospective application to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients, as defined within the standard (\"full retrospective\") or (2) retrospective application with the cumulative effect of adoption recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures, as defined within the standard (\"modified retrospective\"). The Company will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach.\n\nAs required under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d, we routinely review the carrying value of our net assets, including goodwill, to determine if any impairment has occurred. At June 30, 2017, we conducted a quantitative assessment, at which time, based on existing conditions and management's outlook, we determined there was no impairment of NobelClad's goodwill. In the third quarter of 2017, activity in NobelClad's primary end markets slowed considerably. NobelClad experienced a significant decline in its small size core maintenance bookings within the oil and gas industry. Additionally, certain large petrochemical projects previously forecasted to ship in the next twelve months were delayed, and uncertainty existed as to the ultimate timing of booking and shipping these potential orders. As a result, we determined that a potential indicator of goodwill impairment existed during the third quarter of 2017. We utilized an income approach (discounted cash flow analysis) to determine the fair value of the NobelClad reporting unit and concluded that our long-term forecasts were not materializing and needed to be revised downward.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The carrying value of goodwill is periodically reviewed for impairment (at a minimum annually) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Examples of such events or changes in circumstances, many of which are subjective in nature, include significant negative industry or economic trends, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our strategy, a significant decrease in the market value of the asset, and a significant change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $6,747 in 2017 compared with $18,198 for 2016. The decline primarily was due to increased net working capital requirements from higher sales and tendering $3,049 in AD/CVD amounts to U.S. Customs in March 2017 pending ultimate resolution of the AD/CVD case.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 The timing and size of expenditures; \nNet sales increased compared with 2016 due to an 80% increase in DynaEnergetics' net sales driven by a recovery in the North American unconventional well-completions sector and reflected increased well-stage counts; higher completion intensity and longer laterals; and increased market penetration of DynaEnergetics' perforating products and systems. The increase in DynaEnergetics' net sales partially was offset by a 22% decline in NobelClad's net sales as weak capital spending in NobelClad's industrial infrastructure and energy markets resulted in a decline in core repair and maintenance work and the absence of large projects.\n \u2022 General economic conditions, both domestic and foreign, impacting our business and the business of the end-market users we serve; \n \u2022 Consolidated gross profit of 31% in 2017 increased from 25% in 2016. The improvement primarily related to a higher proportion of DynaEnergetics sales relative to NobelClad sales, combined with higher average selling prices as well as improved product mix in DynaEnergetics. \n(4) Amounts represent commitments to purchase goods or services to be utilized in the normal course of business. These amounts are not reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nGeneral and administrative expenses declined compared with 2015 primarily due to lower salaries and wages and outside service costs.\nAs of December 31, 2017, U.S. dollar revolving loans of $18,250 were outstanding under our 2015 syndicated credit facility and our available borrowing capacity was approximately $16,750.\n\nPlease refer to Note 2 \"Significant Accounting Policies\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their anticipated effect on our business.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nNet sales decreased compared with 2015 due to lower volume and average selling prices resulting from the lower demand for well completions in the oil and gas sector.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nSelling and distribution expenses decreased compared with 2015 principally due to lower salaries and benefits, a reduction in bad debt expense, and lower outside sales agent commissions in DynaEnergetics driven by sales volume in territories in which we do not have an internal sales team.\n \u2022 The impacts of pending or future litigation or regulatory matters; \nIncome tax provision of $3,569 for 2017 compared with an income tax provision of $797 for 2016. The current-year income tax provision included $946 of which was a transition tax related to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"). The transition tax is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits ( E&P\u201d) of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. To determine the amount of the transition tax, we must determine, among other things, the amount of post-1986 E&P of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. We made a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and recorded a provisional transition tax obligation of $946, of which $871 is recorded in other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, we continue to gather additional information to compute more precisely the post-1986 E&P and related non-U.S. income taxes paid. The TCJA's transition tax is payable over eight years beginning in 2018. Upon completion of the analysis of post-1986 E&P and related non-U.S. income taxes paid, revisions to our transition tax obligation, if necessary, will be recorded in the 2018 tax provision. Additionally, we currently are unable to recognize tax benefits associated with losses incurred in certain jurisdictions due to valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions.\n \u2022 Product pricing and margins; \nWe have historically financed our operations from a combination of internally generated cash flow, revolving credit borrowings, and various long-term debt arrangements. We believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our current credit facilities and any future replacement thereof will be sufficient to fund the working capital, debt service, dividends, announced expansion plans for DynaEnergetics as well as other capital expenditure requirements of our current business operations for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations will depend upon our success in executing our strategies. If we are unable to (i) realize sales from our backlog; (ii) secure new customer orders; (iii) continue selling products at attractive margins; and (iv) continue to implement cost-effective internal processes, our ability to meet cash requirements through operating activities could be impacted. Also, continued heightened litigation costs or unfavorable court decisions in ongoing patent infringement litigation or anti-dumping and countervailing duties (\"AD/CVD\") matters could negatively impact our ability to meet future cash requirements. Furthermore, any restriction on the availability of borrowings under our credit facilities could negatively affect our ability to meet future cash requirements. In March 2017, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been declared effective, and on which we registered for sale up to $150 million of certain of our securities from time to time and on terms that we may determine in the future. Our ability to access this capital may be limited by market conditions at the time of any future potential offering. There can be no assurance that any such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nGross profit percentage increased compared with 2016 primarily due to better margins on the mix of projects in the current year.\nBusiness Combinations\nAdjusted EBITDA declined due to the factors discussed above. See \"Overview\" above for the explanation of the use of Adjusted EBITDA. The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA.\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities for 2015 totaled $1,788, which included net borrowings on bank lines of credit of $5,003, payment of quarterly dividends of $2,260, and payment of deferred debt issuance costs of $1,222.\n \u2022 The timely completion of contracts; \n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nForward-Looking Statements\nGoodwill impairment charge in 2015 was to fully write off goodwill related to the DynaEnergetics segment. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" for further discussion.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities for 2016 totaled $12,107, which included net repayments on bank lines of credit of $11,250 and payment of quarterly dividends of $1,150.\nThese forward-looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include those relating to:\n(1) Represents outstanding borrowings under our U.S. dollar revolving line of credit. For more information about our debt obligations, see Note 3 \"Debt\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBusiness Segment Financial Information\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Any effects of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment. The deferred income tax impact of tax credits are recognized as an immediate adjustment to income tax expense. We recognize deferred tax assets for the expected future effects of all deductible temporary differences to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. We record a valuation allowance when, based on current circumstances, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, recent financial operations and their associated valuation allowances, if any.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n\nAsset impairments\nGoodwill impairment charge related to fully impairing NobelClad's goodwill balance.\n(3) The license agreements obligations presented reflect future minimum payments due under non-cancelable portions of our agreements as of December 31, 2017. Our license agreements obligations are described in Note 8 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThis annual report and the documents incorporated by reference into it contain certain forward-looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigations Reform Act of 1995. Words such as anticipates,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d plans,\u201d believes,\u201d seeks,\u201d estimates,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d continue,\u201d project,\u201d forecast,\u201d and similar expressions, as well as statements in the future tense, identify forward-looking statements. Such statements include projections, guidance and other statements regarding our future expected financial position and operating results, our growth and business strategy, our expectations regarding the oil and gas industry, the timing and costs of our Blum, Texas and other expansion plans, our plans to consolidate NobelClad's European production facilities, including the timing and costs involved in closing manufacturing operations in France, our expectations regarding NobelClad's sales, bookings, and backlog in 2018, impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our financing plans, our future liquidity position and factors impacting such position, and the outcome of the pending GEODynamics and anti-dumping matters.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical Consolidated Financial Statements and notes, as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this annual report.\nNet Debt is a non-GAAP measure we use to supplement information in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We define net debt as lines of credit less cash and cash equivalents. In addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses this information to evaluate its performance, and we believe that certain investors may do the same.\nGross profit percentage increased compared with 2015 primarily due to the impact of a $6,205 accrual recorded in 2015 for anti-dumping and countervailing duties and favorable product mix in 2016 partially offset by lower average selling prices and higher research and development expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased due to the factors discussed above. See \"Overview\" above for the explanation of the use of Adjusted EBITDA. The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA.\nCash flows from investing activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the net sales, segment operating income or loss, and Adjusted EBITDA for each segment was as follows:\nIn management's opinion, the more significant reporting areas impacted by management's judgments and estimates are revenue recognition, asset impairments, goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes. Management's judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources, and actual results could differ from the estimates, as additional information becomes known. We believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies.\n\nOverview\nWe determined that the estimated fair value of the NobelClad reporting unit was less than its carrying value primarily due to the factors described above and their related impact on expected future cash flows. During the third quarter, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2017-04 which amends and simplifies how an entity measures a goodwill impairment loss by eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. As the carrying value of the NobelClad reporting unit exceeded the fair value by more than the book value of goodwill, we recorded an impairment charge of $17,584 to fully impair the goodwill related to this reporting unit as of September 30, 2017.\nCash flows from financing activities\nOn March 8, 2018, we entered into a five-year $75,000 syndicated credit agreement ( credit facility\u201d) which replaced in its entirety our prior syndicated credit facility entered into on February 23, 2015. The new credit facility allows for revolving loans of up to $50,000 with a $20,000 US dollar equivalent sublimit for alternative currency loans. In addition, the new agreement provides for a $25,000 Capital Expenditure Facility ( Capex Facility)\u201d which is to be used to finance our DynaEnergetics manufacturing expansion project in Blum, Texas. The Capex facility allows for advances to fund capital expenditures of the Blum expansion project during year one of the credit facility. At the end of year one, the Capex Facility will convert to a term loan which will be amortizable at 12.5% of principal per year with a balloon payment for the outstanding balance upon the credit facility maturity date in year five. The new facility has a $100,000 accordion feature to increase the commitments under the revolving loan class and/or by adding a term loan subject to approval by applicable lenders. We entered into the credit facility with a syndicate of three banks, with KeyBank, N.A. acting as administrative agent. The syndicated credit facility is secured by the assets of DMC including accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets, as well as guarantees and share pledges by DMC and its subsidiaries.\n\nSelling and distribution expenses increased compared with 2016 primarily due to higher salaries and wages and higher outside service costs, partially offset by lower bad debt expense.\nBorrowings under the $20,000 Alternate Currency sublimit can be in Euros, Canadian dollars, Pounds sterling, and in any other currency acceptable to the administrative agent. Alternative currency borrowings denominated in Euros, Pounds sterling, and any other currency that is dealt with on the London Interbank Deposit Market shall be comprised of LIBOR loans and bear interest at the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin (varying from 1.50% to 3.00%).\n \u2022 Our ability to realize sales from our backlog and our ability to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain; \n \u2022 Consolidated selling, general, and administrative expenses were $45,724 in 2017 compared with $38,741 in 2016. The increase primarily was due to higher patent litigation expenses at DynaEnergetics and increased salaries and wages from headcount additions and higher variable incentive compensation expense. \n \u2022 NobelClad's sales of $71,550 in 2017 decreased 22% compared with 2016 as weak capital spending in NobelClad's industrial infrastructure and energy markets resulted in a decline in core repair and maintenance work and the absence of large projects. \nGeneral and administrative expenses increased compared with 2016 primarily due to higher outside legal expenses related to patent infringement defense costs in DynaEnergetics, higher salaries and wages from headcount additions and increased variable incentive compensation, and higher stock-based compensation expense.\nGoodwill\n \u2022 The application of governmental regulation and oversight of our operations and products and the industries in which our customers operate; \nCash flows from operating activities\n \u2022 The timely receipt of government approvals and permits; \n \u2022 Restructuring expenses of $4,283 in 2017 were related to the planned closure of NobelClad's manufacturing operations in France and the closure of DynaEnergetics' sales and distribution facility in Kazakhstan. Restructuring expenses of $1,202 in 2016 primarily related to severance for headcount reductions and lease termination costs at DynaEnergetics. \nUnless stated otherwise, all dollar figures in this report are presented in thousands (000s). N/M indicates that the change in dollars or percentage was not meaningful.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNobelClad is a global leader in the production of explosion-welded clad metal plates for use in the construction of corrosion resistant industrial processing equipment and specialized transition joints. While a significant portion of the demand for our clad metal products is driven by maintenance and retrofit projects at existing chemical processing, petrochemical processing, oil refining, and aluminum smelting facilities, new plant construction and large plant expansion projects also account for a significant portion of total demand. These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and timing of new order inflow remains difficult to predict. We use backlog as a primary means to measure the immediate outlook for our NobelClad business. We define backlog\u201d at any given point in time as all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time. Most firm purchase orders and commitments are realized, and we expect to fill most backlog orders within the following 12 months. NobelClad's backlog increased to $37,529 at December 31, 2017 from $31,634 at December 31, 2016.\n\nBorrowings under the $50,000 revolving loan and $25,000 Capex term loan can be in the form of one, two, three, or six month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) loans. Additionally, US dollar borrowings on the revolving loan can be in the form of Base Rate loans (Base Rate borrowings are based on the greater of the administrative agent's Prime rates, an adjusted Federal Funds rates or an adjusted LIBOR rate). LIBOR loans bear interest at the applicable LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin (varying from 1.50% to 3.00%). Base Rate loans bear interest at the defined Base rate plus an applicable margin (varying from 0.50% to 2.00%).\nAdjusted EBITDA increased compared with 2016 primarily due to the factors discussed above. See \"Overview\" above for the explanation of the use of Adjusted EBITDA. The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA.\nNobelClad\nRestructuring expenses in 2015 related to shifting the majority of clad metal plate production from facilities in both Rivesaltes, France and W\u00fcrgendorf, Germany to the new manufacturing facility in Liebenscheid, Germany.\nOur historical Consolidated Financial Statements and notes to our historical Consolidated Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that our management make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. However, the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity. Existing rules must be interpreted and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us.\nCost of products sold for DynaEnergetics includes the cost of metals, explosives and other raw materials used to manufacture shaped charges, detonating products and perforating guns as well as employee compensation and benefits, depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment, manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses.\nThe presence of non-GAAP financial measures in this report is not intended to suggest that such measures be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or as superior to, DMC's GAAP information, and investors are cautioned that the non-GAAP\n \u2022 Competitive factors; \nThe effects of these factors are difficult to predict. New factors emerge from time to time and we cannot assess the potential impact of any such factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this annual report, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In addition, see Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of these and other factors that could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased compared with 2016 primarily due to higher outside legal expenses related to patent infringement defense costs and higher salaries and wages from headcount additions and variable incentive compensation expense.\nOperating income was $15,470 in 2017 compared to an operating loss of $5,380 in 2016 due to higher unit volume, favorable product mix and higher average selling prices, partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses.\n \u2022 Our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses; \n \u2022 To address the accelerating demand for its perforating systems, in December 2017, DynaEnergetics commenced construction of a new 74,000 square foot manufacturing, assembly and administrative space on its manufacturing campus in Blum, Texas. The facility, which is scheduled to open during the third quarter of 2018, will substantially increase DynaEnergetics' component manufacturing and DynaStage assembly capacity. During the first half of 2018, DynaEnergetics plans to add a second automated DynaSelect detonator line at its facility in Troisdorf, Germany. In the second half of 2018, the business plans to add a second automated shaped-charge manufacturing line at Blum, which will more than double its shaped charge production capacity in the U.S. \nWe declared and paid quarterly dividends aggregating $0.08 per share in 2017 and $0.08 per share in 2016. We may pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Future dividends may be affected by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements, future business prospects, debt covenant compliance considerations, changes in income tax laws, and any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Any determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors.\nDynaEnergetics\nNet loss in 2016 was $6,505, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $23,971, or $1.72 per diluted share, in 2015.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIncome tax provision of $797 for 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of $2,118 for 2015.

segments - NobelClad and DynaEnergetics. NobelClad produces explosion-welded clad metal plates and DynaEnergetics designs and manufactures products for the oil and gas industry. \n\n- Net sales were $192.8 million in 2017, up 22% from 2016, driven by an 80% increase in DynaEnergetics sales due to a recovery in the North American well completions market. This was partially offset by a 22% decline in NobelClad sales due to weak capital spending in its end markets.\n\n- Operating loss was $12.3 million in 2017 compared to $5.3 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $17.6 million goodwill impairment charge and $4.3 million in restructuring expenses in 2017.\n\n- Net loss was $18.9 million or $1.31 per diluted share in 2017, compared to net loss of $6.5 million or $0.46 per diluted share in 2016. The higher net loss was primarily due to the goodwill impairment and restructuring charges. \n\n- Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 157% to $23.1 million in 2017 from $9.0 million in 2016, primarily due to higher sales and improved margins in DynaEnergetics.\n\n- The company expects improved demand for NobelClad's products in 2018 based on higher energy prices and enthusiasm for domestic infrastructure spending. DynaEnergetics is expanding capacity to meet growing demand for its perforating systems."}
