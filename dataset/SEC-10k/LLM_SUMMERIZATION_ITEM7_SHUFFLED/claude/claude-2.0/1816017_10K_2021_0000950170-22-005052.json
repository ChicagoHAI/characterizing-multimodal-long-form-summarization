Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those set forth in the sections titled Risk Factors\u201d and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Our fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are referred to herein as fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020, respectively. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d and similar terms refer to Spire and its subsidiaries.\nOverview\nWe are a global provider of space-based data, analytics and space services, offering unique datasets and powerful insights about Earth from the ultimate vantage point-space-so that organizations can make decisions with confidence, accuracy and speed. We own and operate one of the world's largest multi-purpose satellite constellations in low earth orbit. Our fully deployed constellation consists of over 100 satellites and we believe it is also one of the world's largest listening\u201d constellations, observing the earth utilizing radio frequency sensors. We enrich this hard-to-acquire, valuable data with analytics and predictive solutions, providing data as a subscription to organizations around the world so that they can improve business operations, decrease their environmental footprint, deploy resources for growth and competitive advantage and mitigate risk.\nIn December 2021, our satellite constellation covered the earth over 200 times per day on average and our global ground station network performed over 2,300 contacts each day on average, reliably and resiliently collecting data with low latency. Our cloud-based data infrastructure processed five terabytes of data each day on average in December 2021, in creating our proprietary data analytics solutions. We provide customers these solutions through an API infrastructure that delivers approximately one terabyte of data each day to our customers, as of December 31, 2021. The global data we collect includes data that can only be captured from space with no terrestrial alternatives. We collect this data once and can then sell it an unlimited number of times across a broad and growing set of industries, including weather, aviation and maritime, with global coverage, real-time and near real-time data that can be easily integrated into our customers' operations.\nOur platform applies our value-add insights and predictive analytics to this proprietary data to create commercially valuable datasets. We offer three data solutions to our customers, which vary in complexity and price and can be delivered in near real-time via our API that can be easily integrated into our customers' business operations:\n\u2022Maritime: Precise space-based data used for highly accurate ship monitoring, ship safety and route optimization.\n\u2022Aviation: Precise space-based data used for highly accurate aircraft monitoring, aircraft safety and route optimization.\n\u2022Weather: Precise space-based data used for highly accurate weather forecasting.\nFor each data solution, we have the capability to offer customers a variety of features and additional value. The four forms of data we monetize are:\n\u2022Clean data: Clean and structured data directly from our proprietary nanosatellites;\n\u2022Smart data: Clean data fused with third-party datasets and proprietary analysis to enhance value and provide insights;\n\u2022Predictive solutions: Big data, AI, and ML algorithms applied to fused data sets to create predictive analytics and insights; and\n\u2022Solutions: Data-driven actionable recommendations to solve specific business problems, utilizing the full spectrum of our data analytics suite.\nThese value-add data features allow customers to solve various use cases and provide a path to expand throughout the customer's relationship.\nAs our fourth solution, we are also pioneering an innovative business model through our Space Services solution. We leverage our fully deployed infrastructure and large-scale operations to enable our customers to obtain customized data through our API. Our customers can begin receiving data in less than a year after engaging with us and receive data by entering into a subscription agreement. Our Space Services offering provides our customers with fast, scalable and reliable access to space.\nOur solutions are offered to customers across numerous industries and we not only have the opportunity to upsell within each one, but we also have the opportunity to cross-sell among all our solutions.\nWe provide our solutions to global customers through a subscription model or project-based solutions. We currently sell directly to end customers and utilize reseller partners when beneficial.\nHighlights from Fiscal Year 2021\n\u2022On August 16, 2021, we completed the Merger with NavSight and received cash proceeds of $236.6 million and were listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol SPIR.\u201d\n\u2022On November 30, 2021, we completed the acquisition of exactEarth for the purchase price of $129.0 million, consisting of $109.6 million in cash and $22.3 million of shares of our Class A common stock, net of $3.0 million post-combination expense.\n\u2022Full year 2021 revenue was $43.4 million, an increase of 52% from fiscal year 2020. Excluding the $1.5 million of revenue recognized from exactEarth during the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, full year 2021 revenue was $41.9 million, an increase of 47% from fiscal year 2020.\n\u2022As of December 31, 2021, annual recurring revenue ( ARR\u201d) was $70.8 million, an increase of approximately 96% from December 31, 2020. Excluding the $18.5 million of ARR contributed by the acquisition of exactEarth, Spire's December 31, 2021 ARR was $52.3 million, an increase of 44% from December 31, 2020. For the definition of ARR, see the section titled -Key Business Metrics.\u201d\n\u2022We had 255 organic ARR Solution Customers under contract and added 343 from exactEarth, ending the fourth quarter with 598 ARR Solution Customers, a 288% increase year-over-year. For the definition of ARR Solution Customers, see the section titled -Key Business Metrics.\u201d\nCOVID-19 Impact\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and the world and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. While we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic or any resurgences of the pandemic locally or globally, our compliance with these measures has impacted our day-to-day operations and could continue to disrupt our business and operations, as well as that of certain of our customers whose industries are more severely impacted by these measures, for an indefinite period of time. Through fiscal year 2021, we have experienced adverse changes in customer buying behavior that began in March 2020 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including decreased customer engagement, delayed sales cycles, and deterioration in near-term demand. In 2021, the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19 became the dominant strains in numerous countries around the world, including the United States, and are believed to be more contagious than other previously identified COVID-19 strains. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced delays and re-work due to third party satellite launch providers schedule shifts, delays and increased expenses in our hiring process, some attrition from adjusting company policies due to the COVID-19 pandemic and additional time and expenses supporting customer contracts. Despite these headwinds, we experienced an increase in revenue for fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020.\nTo support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities, we have allowed many of our employees to work remotely. As of December 31, 2021, our employees are permitted to come into the office in accordance with all applicable local, State and Federal guidelines and regulations. Our offices will only remain open to the extent local, state and federal authorities permit us to do so and our own criteria and conditions to ensure employee\nhealth and safety are satisfied, including social distancing and enhanced cleaning protocols. While we have developed plans for our employees to begin safely returning to their respective offices, we cannot predict when or how we will be able to completely lift the work from home requirements or other COVID-19 related restrictions for geographic areas that continue to be significantly impacted by the pandemic or certain other actions taken as part of our business continuity plans, including travel restrictions. We may also have to reinstate work from home requirements in response to further changes in local regulations in connection with developments in the COVID-19 pandemic. While the adjustments to our operations may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our solution development, sales, marketing, and customer support efforts, as of the date of this filing, we do not believe our work from home protocol has materially adversely impacted our internal controls, financial reporting systems or our operations.\nIn response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we initially implemented plans to manage our costs. In fiscal year 2020, for part of the year, we temporarily limited the addition of new employees and third-party contracted services, curtailed most travel expenses except where critical to the business, and acted to limit discretionary spending. As we obtained further visibility on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we lifted some of these limitations to support our growth. Although we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance become available, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and/or the precautionary measures that we, our customers and governmental authorities have adopted have resulted in, and could continue to result in, customers not purchasing or renewing our solutions or services, delays or lengthening of our sales cycles, and reductions in average transaction sizes, and could negatively affect our customer success and sales and marketing efforts, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business and operating results. Because our solutions have future obligations and a portion of that revenue is recognized over time, the effect of the pandemic may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. Our competitors could experience similar or different impacts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could result in changes to our competitive landscape. While we have developed and continue to develop plans to help mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on our business, these efforts may not be effective, and any protracted economic downturn could significantly affect our business and operating results. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our business. For additional information regarding the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe that our current and future performance are dependent on many factors, including, but not limited to, those described below. While these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to achieve successful results. For additional information about these risks, see the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d If we are unable to address these risks, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nExpansion of and Further Penetration of Our Customer Base\nWe employ a land and expand\u201d business model that focuses on efficiently acquiring new customers ( land\u201d) and then growing our relationships with these customers over time ( expand\u201d). We have the capability to offer customers additional data sets and a variety of enhanced features that potentially grow the value of the services our customers contract with us. Our future revenue growth and our path to profitability are dependent upon our ability to continue to land new customers and then expand adoption of our solutions within their organizations.\nWe track our progress landing new customers by measuring the number of ARR Solution Customers we have from one fiscal year to the next. For instance, we have increased our number of ARR Solution Customers from 154 for fiscal year 2020 to 598 for fiscal year 2021. We track our progress in expanding our customer relationships by measuring our ARR Net Retention Rate. For the definition of ARR Net Retention Rate, see the section titled -Key Business Metrics.\u201d Our organic ARR Net Retention Rate was 110% for fiscal year 2021 and 154% for fiscal year 2020.\nExpansion into New Industries and Geographies\nAs our solutions have grown, we continue to focus on further penetration of our initial industries including maritime, aviation, logistics and government (civil and defense/intelligence) among others. We believe our technology and solutions give us the ability to also expand into additional industries, including energy, financial services, agriculture, transportation, and insurance, and geographies, including Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. Our revenue growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand into new industries and geographies. The costs associated with these expansions may adversely affect our results of operations.\nInvestment in Growth\nWe continue investing in growing our business and capitalizing on our market opportunity while balancing the uncertainties from the COVID-19 pandemic. We intend to continue to add headcount to our global sales and marketing teams to acquire new customers and to increase sales to existing customers and we intend to continue to add headcount to our research and development teams and otherwise invest to improve and innovate our nanosatellite, ground station and data analytics technologies. For fiscal year 2021, our spending on research and development increased by $10.9 million, or 52%, from fiscal year 2020, which included $0.3 million from the exactEarth acquisition. For fiscal year 2021, our sales and marketing expenses increased by $10.1 million, or 98%, from fiscal year 2020, which included $0.6 million from the exactEarth acquisition. Our total headcount across all functions has increased from 251 employees as of December 31, 2020, to 370 employees as of December 31, 2021, which increase includes 33 exactEarth employees. We believe that these investments will contribute to our long-term growth. The costs of these investments may adversely affect our operating results.\nAcquisitions\nOur business strategy may include, like our November 2021 acquisition of exactEarth, acquiring other complementary solutions, technologies, or businesses that we believe will allow us to reduce the time or costs required to develop new technologies, incorporate enhanced functionality into and complement our existing solution offerings, augment our engineering workforce, and enhance our technological capabilities.\nImpact of Foreign Exchange Rates\nWe report in U.S. dollars, and the functional currency of our foreign operating subsidiaries is the local currency, including the Euro, the British Pound, the Singapore Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. Many of these currencies have strengthened significantly against the U.S. dollar since fiscal year 2020. In fiscal year 2021, approximately 48% of our revenues were generated in non-U.S. dollar-denominated currencies respectively. This compares to fiscal year 2020 where approximately 50% of our revenues were generated in non-U.S. dollar-denominated currencies respectively. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the period for revenues and expenses. To the extent we experience significant currency fluctuations, our results of operations may be impacted.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review the following key business metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions:\n\u2022ARR\n\u2022ARR Customers\n\u2022ARR Solution Customers\n\u2022ARR Net Retention Rate\nAnnual Recurring Revenue\nWe define ARR as our expected annualized revenue from customers that are under contract with us at the end of the reporting period with a binding and renewable agreement for our subscription solutions, or a customer that has a binding multi-year contract that can range from components of our Space Services solution to a project-based customer solution. Project-based contracts or customers are considered recurring when they have signed a multi-year binding agreement that has a renewable component in the contract or a customer that has multiple contracts that we continue to have under contract over multiple years.\nCustomer contracts for data trials and one-time transactions are excluded from the calculation of ARR.\nOur ARR growth in the periods presented has been driven by both landing new ARR Customers along with increasing the amount of business with our existing customers. This is reflected in the increase in the total number of ARR Customers as well as ARR Net Retention Rates that have been over 100% for the periods presented. Due in part to the timing of some of our project-based contracts, including when engagements start and stop, our ARR has fluctuated from period to period in the past, and we expect our ARR to fluctuate from period to period in the future. ARR is a leading indicator and accordingly will tend to outpace the revenue impact as we recognize the contract value over time.\nThe following table summarizes our ARR at each fiscal year end for the periods indicated.\nTable 7: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2020 %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ARR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nARR increased by $34.6 million, or 96%, of which $18.5 million was attributable to our acquisition of exactEarth. Our organic ARR growth was 44%.\nNumber of ARR Customers and ARR Solution Customers\nWe define an ARR Customer as an entity that has a contract with us or through our reseller partners contracts, that is either a binding and renewable agreement for our subscription solutions, or a binding multi-year contract as of the measurement date independent of the number of solutions the entity has under contract. A single organization with separate subsidiaries, segments, or divisions may represent multiple customers, as we treat each entity that is invoiced separately as an individual customer. In cases where customers subscribe to our platform through our reseller partners, each end customer that meets the above definition is counted separately as an ARR Customer. All entities that have contracts for data trials and one-time transactions are excluded from the calculation of ARR Customers.\nWe define an ARR Solution Customer similarly to an ARR Customer, but we count every solution the customer has with us separately. As a result, the count of ARR Solution Customers exceeds the count of ARR Customers in each year as some customers contract with us for multiple solutions. Our multiple solutions customers are those customers that are under contract for at least two of our solutions: Maritime, Aviation, Weather, and Space Services. All entities that have contracts for data trials and one-time transactions are excluded from the calculation of ARR Solution Customers.\nOur ARR Customer and ARR Solution Customer growth in the periods presented have been driven by landing new ARR Customers across our four solutions (Maritime, Aviation, Weather and Space Services) and expanding our geographical footprint, along with having a low number of customers who have chosen not to renew their contracts with us. We believe that our ability to expand our customer base is a key indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business, and our future potential business opportunities.\nThe following table summarizes the number of our ARR Customers and ARR Solution Customers at each fiscal year end for the periods indicated:\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2020 %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ARR Customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>299\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ARR Solution Customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nARR Customers grew by 431, or 299%. The addition of exactEarth added 343 ARR Customers. Our organic ARR Customer growth was 61%. ARR Solution Customers grew by 444. The addition of exactEarth added 343 ARR Solution Customers. Our organic ARR Solution Customer growth was 66%.\nARR Net Retention Rate\nWe calculate our ARR Net Retention Rate for a particular fiscal period end by dividing (i) our ARR from those ARR Customers that were also customers as of the last day of the prior fiscal period end by (ii) the ARR from all customers as of the last day of the prior fiscal period. This calculation measures the overall impact from increases in customer contract value (upsells), the decreases in customer contract value (downsells), and the decreases in customer value resulting from customers that have chosen not to renew their contracts with us.\nThe following table summarizes our ARR Net Retention Rate at each fiscal year end for the periods indicated (excludes exactEarth):\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2020 %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ARR Net Retention Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur ARR Net Retention Rate can be impacted from period to period by large increases or decreases in customer contract value and large decreases in contract value from customers that have chosen not to renew their contracts with us. An ARR Net Retention Rate greater than 100% is an indication that we are growing the value of the solutions our customers are purchasing from us from a fiscal period end versus the prior fiscal period end. An ARR Net Retention Rate less than 100% is an indication that we are reducing the value of the solutions our customers are purchasing from us from a fiscal period end versus the prior fiscal period end. For fiscal year 2021, our ARR Net Retention Rate decreased 29% from fiscal year 2020. This decrease was driven by the growth in our ARR renewable base, a higher concentration of new customer ARR versus upsell, and delays in certain Space Services contracts that caused the contract value to spread over a longer period.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive revenue from providing data, insights, and access to our cloud-based technology platform sold on a subscription basis. Some of our customer arrangements include the delivery of specific performance obligations and subsequent customer acceptance of project-based deliverables, which may impact the timing of revenue recognition. Subscription periods for our solutions generally range from one to two years and are typically non-cancelable, with customers having the right to terminate their agreements only if we materially breach our obligations under the agreement. Our subscription fees are typically billed either monthly or quarterly in advance.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs, depreciation, hosted infrastructure and high-power computing costs, third-party operating and royalty costs associated with delivering our data and services to our customers, and amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the exactEarth acquisition. Personnel costs are primarily related to the cost of our employees supporting and managing our constellation operations including satellite operations, ground station control and launch management. Costs associated with the manufacture and launch of our satellites, including personnel costs, are capitalized and depreciated upon placement in service, typically over a three year expected useful life. As satellites reach their expected end of useful life, they are generally replaced with replenishment satellites to maintain our constellation at optimal performance. Costs associated with the acquisition and development of new ground stations, including the bill of materials and labor to install the ground station, are capitalized and depreciated upon placement in service typically over a four-year expected useful life. We anticipate ongoing capital spending to repair and replenish ground stations as they reach their end of useful life to keep our ground station network at optimal performance. Our proprietary ground station network is primarily located in third-party locations where we incur lease and other operational charges. Cost of revenue also includes royalties associated with third-party data sets that we integrate into our data solutions.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, third-party consulting fees, and computing costs. Our research and development efforts are focused on improving our satellite technology, developing new data sets, developing new algorithms and enhancing our smart and predictive analytics, and enhancing the ease of use and utility of our space-based data solutions.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, sales commissions, marketing and advertising costs, costs incurred in the development of customer relationships, brand development costs, travel-related expenses and amortization of purchased intangible backlog associated with the exactEarth acquisition. Commission costs on new customer contract bookings are considered costs of obtaining customer contracts. Commission costs for multi-year deals are considered contract acquisition costs and are deferred and then amortized over the period of the contract excluding the last 12 months, which are expensed at the beginning of that final period. Commission costs on contracts completed with a term of twelve months or less are expensed in the period incurred.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related expenses for personnel in our executive, finance and accounting, facilities, legal, human resources, global supply chain, and management information systems functions, as well as other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees related to third-party legal counsel, fees related to accounting, tax and audit costs, office facilities costs, software subscription costs, and other corporate costs.\nLoss on Satellite Deorbit and Launch Failure. Loss on Satellite Deorbit and Launch Failure consists of the write-off of the remaining capitalized costs associated with the manufacture and launch of our satellites prior to the end of the satellite's useful life. We contract with third-party companies to launch, carry, and deploy our LEMUR satellites into space. A loss could result from a third-party launch or deployer failure, a technical failure of the satellite, or the deorbit of a satellite before the end of the satellite's useful life. A technical failure could include a satellite that is not able to communicate with our network of\nground stations or fulfill its intended technical mission for a duration greater than one month. The loss amount is presented net of any insurance claims received. We did not incur any of these expenses in fiscal year 2021. We incurred $0.7 million in expenses in fiscal year 2020.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Income. Interest Income includes interest earned on our cash balances.\nInterest Expense. Interest Expense includes interest costs associated with our promissory and convertible notes, and amortization of deferred financing costs.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Earnout Liability. Change in Fair Value of Contingent Earnout Liability includes mark-to-market adjustments to reflect changes in fair value of the contingent earnout liability.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities. Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities includes mark-to-market adjustments to reflect changes in fair value of warrant liabilities.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net. Other (Expense) Income, Net consists primarily of tax credits, grant income, the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses, benefit from loan forgiveness, loss on debt extinguishment, and sales and local taxes. We use the local currency as our functional currency for Luxembourg, United Kingdom, Singapore and Canada.\nIncome Tax Provision\nProvision for income taxes consists of federal and certain state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions. We do not provide for income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since we intend to invest these earnings outside of the United States permanently. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared to

number of ARR Customers combined with our ARR Net Retention Rate greater than 100%. The exactEarth acquisition added $1.5 million of revenue in fiscal year 2021. Our organic ARR Customers increased 61%, from 144 as of fiscal year 2020 to 232 as of fiscal year 2021, which contributed to an increase in revenue from new customers. Our organic ARR Net Retention Rate was 110% during fiscal year 2021, which contributed to an increase in revenue from our existing customer base.\nFor fiscal year 2021, we derived 48% of our revenue from Europe, Middle East, Africa ( EMEA\u201d), 36% of our revenue from the Americas and 16% of our revenue from Asia Pacific ( APAC\u201d). For fiscal year 2020, we derived 50% of our revenue from EMEA, 38% of our revenue from the Americas, and 12% of our revenue from APAC. For fiscal year 2021, we derived 47% of our revenue from subscription arrangements, compared to 27% for fiscal year 2020. This percentage mix can fluctuate significantly from period to period driven primarily by the timing of the non-subscription revenue recognition in our contracts.\nFor fiscal year 2021, our increase in the number of ARR Customers and our ARR Net Retention Rate greater than 100% was driven by our increased spending on sales and marketing activities, the geographical expansion of our sales efforts into new countries and/or regions and the development and rollout of new data solutions.\nOver time, we expect the mix of our total revenues in the Americas and APAC to continue to increase with additional sales and marketing focus in those regions.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2020 %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Headcount (at period end)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue increased $8.4 million, or 82%, $1.7 million of this growth was due to the addition of exactEarth operating costs, retention and stock acceleration expenses. Organic increases were primarily driven by an increase in depreciation expense of $2.2 million, an increase in computing costs of $2.2 million, third party royalty costs increases of $1.0 million, $0.7 million of space services hardware expenses and $0.2 million higher personnel expenses, with the remainder in higher miscellaneous operating expenses. Depreciation expense increased from the prior period driven by continued additions to our constellation. The increase in computing costs were driven by higher expenses to support customer growth and some of our weather solutions transitioning from research and development to production. The increase in third party royalty costs was driven by an increase in sales activity, resulting in higher payments to third-party data set providers as they augment our data solutions. The increase in space services third-party hardware expenses was in support of a strategic customer commitment. The increase in personnel expenses was driven by headcount growth.\nGross margin for fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020 was 57% and 64%, respectively. The decrease in fiscal year 2021 gross margin compared to fiscal year 2020 was driven primarily by higher depreciation, computing expenses, royalties, and strategic customer expenses as described above. This metric can fluctuate significantly from period to period driven primarily by the timing of the revenue as well as the timing of our technology investments to support future revenue. The exactEarth acquisition negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 2%. Of this reduction, approximately half was driven by purchase accounting adjustments including reduction to exactEarth deferred revenue and amortization of purchased intangibles.\nWe expect cost of revenue, including depreciation and amortization expenses, third-party operating costs and royalties, and high-powered computing costs, to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. Additionally, we expect the purchase accounting adjustments associated with the exactEarth acquisition, namely higher amortization expenses and lower deferred revenue, to grow in relative terms as we absorb the impact on a full year basis. These items will likely have a negative impact on gross margin for at least the near term.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of our research and development, our sales and marketing, and our general and administrative expenses. As we continue to invest in our growth, including through hiring additional personnel, we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars as revenue grows; however, we expect our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to decrease over time.\nResearch and Development\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2020 %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Headcount (at end of period)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased $10.8 million, or 52%. $0.7 million of this growth was due to the addition of exactEarth operating costs, retention and stock acceleration expenses.

The increase in personnel costs was driven by growth in headcount during the period. The increase in computing costs were driven by additional testing, modeling, and storage requirements used to develop new solutions. The increase in third-party services was driven by external technical resources required to support new development processes and capabilities.\nWhile we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods primarily due to higher headcount as we continue to invest in the development of our solutions offerings and new technologies, we expect research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in future periods as our revenue growth exceeds our growth in research and development spend.\nSales and Marketing\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2020 %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Headcount (at end of period)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expenses increased $10.1 million, or 98%. $1.2 million of this growth was due to the addition of exactEarth operating costs, retention and stock acceleration expenses.

The increase in personnel costs was driven by growth in our headcount involved in selling activities. The increase in marketing and professional services costs was driven by growth in our expenditures for demand generation, brand awareness and public relations. The increase in travel expense was due to improved travel conditions following the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhile we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to grow in absolute dollars in the future, primarily due to increased employee-related expenses as we grow our headcount, to support our sales and marketing efforts and our continued expansion of our sales capacity across our solutions, we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue to decrease in future periods as our revenue growth exceeds our growth in sales and marketing spend.\nGeneral and Administrative\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2020 %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percentage of total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Headcount (at end of period)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $28.0 million, or 223%. $2.2 million of this growth was due to the addition of exactEarth operating costs, retention and stock acceleration expenses.

The increase in professional and consulting fees was primarily driven by accounting, legal and other consulting services associated with the Merger, company readiness for going public and the exactEarth acquisition. The increase in personnel costs was driven by stock-based compensation expense associated with a performance-based equity incentive program as well as overall headcount growth. The increase in business insurance was driven by incremental exposure associated with being a public company.

In connection with the Merger, eligible Spire equity holders are entitled to receive additional shares of our common stock upon our achievement of certain Earnout Triggering Events which are treated as liabilities and required to be marked to market each reporting period.

For additional information, see Notes 2, 3 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities increased by $1.4 million, driven by the mark-to-market adjustment to reflect the fair market valuation of our public and private warrants. For additional information, see Notes 2, 10 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther (expense) income, net increased $5.8 million, or 709%, primarily driven by $5.0 million in debt extinguishment expenses resulting from paying off the EIB Loan and the Eastward Loan Facilities, and an increase in realized and unrealized foreign exchange expense of $1.9 million, and $0.3 million of miscellaneous other expenses, offset by an increase of $1.7 million in grant income driven by the extinguishment of debt resulting from the U.S. government's forgiveness of our loan under the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES\u201d) Act.\nWe continue to experience foreign currency fluctuations as we re-measure foreign currency denominated transactions and balances into the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Our results of operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the Euro, British Pound, Singapore Dollar and Canadian Dollar. We may continue to experience favorable or adverse foreign currency exchange impacts due to volatility in these currencies relative to their respective functional currencies.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2020 %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax increased $0.1 million, or 24%, primarily driven by higher income tax in our United Kingdom subsidiary.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe that in addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our business, results of operations and financial condition. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and facilitates period to period comparisons of operations, as this eliminates the effects of certain variables from period to period for reasons that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance. In addition to our GAAP measures, we use this non-GAAP financial measure internally for budgeting and resource allocation purposes and in analyzing our financial results.\nFor the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the following items provides information that is helpful in understanding our results of operations, evaluating our future prospects, comparing our financial results across accounting periods, and comparing our financial results to our peers, many of which provide similar non-GAAP financial measures.\n\u2022Loss on satellite deorbit and launch failure. We exclude loss on satellite deorbit and launch failure because if there was no loss, the expense would be accounted for as depreciation and would also be excluded as part of our EBITDA calculation.\n\u2022Other (expense) income, net. We exclude other (expense) income, net because it includes one-time and other items that do not reflect the underlying operational results of our business.\n\u2022Stock-based compensation. We exclude stock-based compensation expenses primarily because they are non-cash expenses that we exclude from our internal management reporting processes. We also find it useful to exclude these expenses when we assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FASB ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation ( ASC 718\u201d), we believe excluding stock-based compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business results of operations and those of other companies.\n\u2022Change in fair value of warrant liabilities and contingent earnout liabilities. Spire excludes this as it does not reflect the underlying cash flows or operational results of the business.\n\u2022Amortization of purchased intangibles. Spire incurs amortization expense for purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies. Amortization of intangible assets is a non-cash expense and is inconsistent in amount and frequency because it is significantly affected by the timing, size of acquisitions and the inherent subjective nature of purchase price allocations. Because these costs have already been incurred and cannot be recovered, and are non-cash expenses, Spire excludes these expenses for its internal management reporting processes. Spire's management also finds it useful to exclude these charges when assessing the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to Spire's revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to Spire's future period revenues as well.\n\u2022Other Acquisition Accounting Amortization. Spire incurs amortization expense for purchased data rights in connection with the acquisition of exactEarth and certain technologies. Amortization of this asset is a non-cash expense that can be significantly affected by the inherent subjective nature of the assigned value and useful life. Because this cost has already been incurred and cannot be recovered, and is a non-cash expense, Spire excludes this expense for its internal management reporting processes. Spire's management also finds it useful to exclude this charge when assessing the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods.\n\u2022Mergers and acquisition related expenses. Spire excludes these expenses as these are associated with transaction costs that are generally one time in nature and not reflective of the underlying operational results of its business.\n\u2022EBITDA. We define EBITDA as net income (loss), plus depreciation and amortization expense, plus interest expense, and plus the provision for (or minus benefit from) income taxes.\n\u2022Other unusual one-time costs. We exclude these as they are unusual items that do not reflect the ongoing operational\nresults of our business.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted for loss on satellite deorbit and launch failure, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, change in value of contingent earnout liability, other (expense) income, net, stock-based compensation, other acquisition accounting amortization, mergers and acquisition related costs and expenses, and other unusual one-time costs. We believe Adjusted EBITDA can be useful in providing an understanding of the underlying operating results and trends and an enhanced overall understanding of our financial performance and prospects for the future. While Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measure under GAAP, management uses this financial measure to evaluate and forecast business performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements, such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments, and tax payments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our use of the term Adjusted EBITDA may vary from the use of similarly titled measures by others in our industry due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation.\n\u2022The presentation of non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors should read this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto also included within.\nThe following table outlines the reconciliation from net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,312\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32,504\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation & amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,839\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on satellite deorbit and launch failure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in fair value of contingent earnout liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(67,026\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in fair value of warrant liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(626\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Mergers and acquisition related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other unusual one-time costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other acquisition accounting amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(37,518\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,639\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLimitations on the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThere are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures because non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures provided by other companies.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which items are adjusted to calculate our non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our public disclosures. Some of these limitations are:\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt;\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect income tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the loss on satellite deorbit and launch failure and does not reflect the cash capital expenditure requirements for the replacements of lost satellites. While these expenses could occur in a given year, the existence and magnitude of these costs could vary greatly and is unpredictable.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity to fund our operations are from cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $109.3 million as of December 31, 2021, mainly from net proceeds from the Merger, borrowings available under the FP Term Loan (as defined below) and the issuance of convertible notes. Of this $109.3 million, approximately $11.6 million was held outside of the United States. These amounts compare to cash and cash equivalents of $15.6 million as of December 31, 2020, of which $5.2 million was held outside of the United States. These amounts are exclusive of restricted cash which totaled $0.4 million as of December 31, 2021, and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2020. Since our inception, we have been in an operating cash flow deficit as we have made significant investments in our technology infrastructure, built out our research and development foundation, grown sales and marketing resources to drive revenue, and scaled general and administrative functions to enable operating effectiveness.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we issued additional convertible notes with a cumulative principal amount of $20.0 million, with maturities of January and February 2025, respectively, which converted into our Class A common stock at the Closing. In April 2021, we entered into the FP Credit Agreement (as defined and further described below), utilizing a portion of those funds to pay-off our existing credit arrangements with EIB and Eastward. In November 2021, we closed our acquisition of exactEarth for the purchase price of $129.0 million, consisting of $109.6 million in cash and $22.3 million of common stock, net of $3.0 million post-combination expense.\nWe expect that our principal sources of liquidity will be the proceeds received from the Merger, the additional convertible notes issued and the FP Term Loan (as defined below). We believe this will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support solution development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the ongoing investments in technology infrastructure, the introduction of new and enhanced solutions, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures, strategic initiatives or investments and our ongoing operations. In the event that we decide, or are required, to seek additional financing from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nNavSight Merger\nOn August 16, 2021, we announced that we had closed our Merger with NavSight. As a result, we became a wholly owned subsidiary of NavSight, and NavSight changed its name to Spire Global, Inc.\u201d\nIn connection with the Merger, we raised $264.8 million of proceeds including the contribution of $230.0 million of cash held in NavSight's trust account from its initial public offering, net of redemptions of NavSight public stockholders of $210.2 million, and $245.0 million of cash in connection with the PIPE Investment. We incurred $38.7 million of merger and acquisitions costs, consisting of banking, legal, and other professional fees, of which $32.1 million was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital, and the remaining $6.6 million was expensed to general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFor more details on the Merger, including all equity conversions, please see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFP Credit Agreement\nOn April 15, 2021, we entered into a credit agreement with FP Credit Partners, L.P., as agent for several lenders (the FP Lenders\u201d) (as amended on May 17, 2021, the FP Credit Agreement\u201d), for a $70.0 million term loan facility (the FP Term Loan\u201d). Upon funding in May 2021, the FP Term Loan was used (i) to pay off our existing credit facilities with Eastward Fund Management, LLC (the Eastward Loan Facility\u201d) and European Investment Bank (the EIB Loan Facility\u201d), and (ii) to fund working capital and for general corporate purposes. We incurred $12.3 million of debt issuance costs relating to the FP Term Loan.\nThe FP Lenders were also entitled to a commitment fee of $1.75 million that was fully earned and paid upon signing the FP Credit Agreement. The FP Term Loan bears interest at a rate of 9.00% per annum. Prior to the Merger, the FP Term Loan bore interest at a rate of 8.50% per annum. Since the FP Lenders elected to exercise their conversion right in connection with the Merger, and we chose not to prepay the remaining, non-converted outstanding principal amount of the FP Term Loan at the closing of such transaction, our interest rate under the FP Term Loan increased to 9.0% per annum.\nInterest on the FP Term Loan is payable quarterly in arrears. The total outstanding principal amount of the FP Term Loan will be due and payable at maturity on April 15, 2026. We may prepay the outstanding principal amount of the FP Term Loan at any time, in full but not in part. In addition, since the FP Lenders elected to exercise their conversion right in connection with the Merger, there is no premium or other contractual return in a prepayment. The aggregate amount required to be repaid in a prepayment to the FP Lenders would only be the outstanding principal amount of the FP Term Loan and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Our obligations under the FP Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our material subsidiaries, as determined in accordance with the FP Credit Agreement, and secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of the subsidiary guarantors.\nThe FP Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, pay dividends or other distributions on our capital stock, dispose of assets, consummate mergers or acquisitions and enter into transactions with affiliates, subject in each case to customary exceptions and qualifications. Prior to the consummation of a Qualifying IPO (as defined in the FP Credit Agreement), which includes the Merger, we were required to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, minimum unrestricted cash of at least $15.0 million, as determined in accordance with the FP Credit Agreement, provided that this covenant did not apply following any fiscal quarter in which we achieved positive EBITDA so long as we continued to maintain positive EBITDA in subsequent fiscal quarters. Since the Merger occurred, we are no longer required to maintain this financial covenant per the terms of the FP Credit Agreement.\nThe FP Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of covenants or representations and warranties, cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events and judgment defaults, subject to grace periods in certain instances. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the FP Lenders may declare all or a portion of the outstanding obligations payable by us to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the FP Credit Agreement. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate will apply on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the FP Credit Agreement at a per annum rate equal to 2% above the otherwise applicable interest rate.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we recognized within Other (expense) income, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, $5.0 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt, resulting from paying off the EIB Loan and the Eastward Loan Facilities.\nEastward Loan Facility\nIn December 2020, we entered into a line of credit agreement with Eastward and certain of our subsidiaries as co-borrowers (the Eastward Loan Facility\u201d). The agreement provided for a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25.0 million, of which we borrowed $15.0 million. We used the proceeds to prepay existing indebtedness and the remaining proceeds were available to be used for general corporate purposes. In connection with funding the term loan under the FP Credit Agreement, we repaid the outstanding obligations under the Eastward Loan Facility, including a prepayment premium and fees of $0.8 million.\nThe Eastward Loan Facility bore interest at a rate of 11.75% per annum, payable monthly in arrears. We were also required to pay a commitment fee equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of each term loan borrowing. Following an interest only period of 24 months, the principal amount of each term loan was repayable in 24 equal monthly installments based on an amortization period of 36 months. The outstanding principal amount of each term loan, plus a repayment fee equal to 2.00% of the original $15.0 million principal amount of such term loan, was due and payable 48 months after such borrowing.\nOur obligations under the Eastward Loan Facility were guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries, as determined in accordance with the loan agreement, and were secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of the co-borrowers. The loan agreement contained customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limited our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, dispose of assets, consummate mergers or acquisitions, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, pay dividends or other distributions on our capital stock, make investments and enter into transactions with affiliates, subject in each case to customary exceptions and qualifications.\nThe Eastward Loan Facility included customary events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of covenants or representations and warranties, an investor abandonment default, cross- defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events and judgment defaults, subject to grace periods in certain instances. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, Eastward had the right to declare all or a portion of the outstanding obligations payable by us to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the loan agreement. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate would have applied on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the loan agreement at a per annum rate equal to 5% above the otherwise applicable interest rate.\nEIB Loan Facility\nIn August 2020, we entered into a finance contract with EIB and Spire Global Luxembourg S.a.r.l., as borrower. The finance contract provided for a term loan facility (the EIB Loan Facility\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of up to EUR 20.0 million, available in three tranches, of which we borrowed EUR 12.0 million. The proceeds of the term loans were required to be used for our innovation and expansion activities in Luxembourg and potentially other EU countries. In connection with funding the term loan under the FP Credit Agreement, we repaid the outstanding obligations under the EIB Loan Facility, including a prepayment premium of EUR 0.2 million.\nThe total outstanding principal amount of each tranche was due and payable five years after the borrowing date for such tranche. The initial tranche of EUR 5.0 million did not accrue interest. The second tranche of EUR 7.0 million accrued interest at a rate equal to EURIBOR plus 5.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. If borrowed, the third tranche of EUR 8.0 million would have accrued interest at a rate equal to EURIBOR plus 10.0% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. We were also required to pay a commitment fee equal to 1.00% per annum of the undrawn term loan commitments from the one-year anniversary of the finance contract through the expiration of the commitments in January 2023.\nOur obligations under the finance contract were guaranteed by our material subsidiaries, as determined in accordance with the finance contract, and were secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of the borrower. The finance contract contained customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limited our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, dispose of assets, consummate mergers or acquisitions, make investments, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens or pay dividends or other distributions on our capital stock, subject in each case to customary exceptions and qualifications.\nThe finance contract included customary events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of covenants or representations and warranties, cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events and a material adverse change event of default, subject to grace periods in certain instances. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, EIB had the right to declare all or a portion of the outstanding obligations to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the finance contract. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate would have applied on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the finance contract at a per annum rate equal to 2% above the otherwise applicable interest rate.\nUnder the terms of the EIB finance contract, on August 20, 2020, we issued to EIB a warrant exercisable for 454,899 shares (Tranche A) of Old Spire Common Stock at a price of $0.0001 per share. Upon completion of the Merger, the exercisable share count converted to 775,966. On October 29, 2020, we issued to EIB an additional warrant exercisable for 454,899 shares (Tranche B) of Old Spire Common Stock at a price of $0.0001 per share. Upon completion of the Merger, the exercisable share count converted to 775,966. Each such warrant included a put option, whereby EIB had the right to have us repurchase the warrants by paying EIB an amount equal to the then-current fair market value of the shares of Old Spire Common Stock for which the warrants were exercisable. The amount that we were required to pay upon the exercise of the put option was subject to a purchase price cap of EUR 10.0 million for each warrant. In September 2021, EIB submitted a notice of cancellation for the 775,966 EIB warrants (Tranche A). In October 2021, EIB submitted a notice of cancellation for the remaining 775,966 EIB warrants (Tranche B). The total settlement value associated with the EIB warrants was $19.9 million and was paid in November 2021. Upon settlement, $12.8 million was released from restricted cash which had been held in guarantee for EIB warrant redemption.\nAcquisition of exactEarth\nIn November 2021, we closed our acquisition of exactEarth for the purchase price of $129.0 million, consisting of $109.6 million in cash and $22.3 million of common stock, net of $3.0 million post-combination expense. The acquisition of exactEarth accelerates growth of our existing maritime business with additional data solutions, cross-selling opportunities, and expansion of our geographic footprint. exactEarth is now a fully-owned subsidiary of Spire Global, Inc. and will continue to conduct operations from Cambridge, Ontario, Canada.\nFor additional detail regarding the terms associated with the exactEarth acquisition, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGovernment Loan\nAs part of our acquisition of exactEarth in November 2021, we assumed a loan agreement with the Strategic Innovation Fund (\"SIF\") which was recorded at fair value of the debt. As of December 31, 2021, $4.5 million was included in Long-term debt, non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under this agreement and subsequent amendment, we are eligible to receive funding for certain expenditures incurred from February 13, 2018 to May 12, 2023, up to a maximum of $5.7 million. The loan is repayable in 15 annual payments beginning February 28, 2026 and has a stated interest rate of zero.\nFor additional detail regarding the terms associated with our financing arrangements, see Notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConvertible Notes\nFrom July 2019 through October 2020, we issued and sold subordinated convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $42.9 million (the 2019 Spire Notes\u201d). In May 2021, we agreed with the holders of the 2019 Spire Notes to extend the maturity date of all convertible promissory notes outstanding at December 31, 2020 from January 29, 2022 to July 31, 2022. From January 2021 through February 2021, we issued and sold subordinated convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $20.0 million, which mature four years from the date of issuance (the 2021 Spire Notes\u201d). The 2019 Spire Notes and the 2021 Spire Notes accrued interest at a rate of 8.0% per annum and converted into shares of our common stock in connection with the Closing, so they are no longer outstanding.\nThe following table summarizes our net cash used in operating activities, net cash used in investing activities, and net cash provided by financing activities for the periods indicated:\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(57,986\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,773\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(119,479\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,415\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>270,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash inflows is cash collections from our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, expenses related to our technology infrastructure, expenses related to our computing infrastructure (including compute power, database storage and content delivery costs), building infrastructure costs (including leases for office space), fees for third-party services, and marketing program costs.\nNet cash used in operating activities in fiscal year 2021 was $58.0 million. This reflected our net loss of $19.3 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $36.3 million, and a net decrease in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.2 million. Non-cash items primarily included $11.6 million of stock-based compensation,\n$8.5 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $6.0 million of non-cash interest and debt issuance amortization expense, $2.3 million on debt extinguishment expense, $1.6 million on warrant liability revaluation, and $0.5 million of other non-cash expenses offset by $67.0 million non-cash gain on the contingent earnout liability revaluation. The net decrease in operating assets and liabilities primarily included an increase of $6.7 million in other current assets combined with a $5.0 million increase in accounts receivable. This was offset by an increase of $4.7 million in accrued wages and other expenses, a $2.3 million increase in accounts payable, a $2.2 million increase in other long term liabilities, and a $0.3 million increase in other non-cash assets and liabilities.\nNet cash used in operating activities in fiscal year 2020 was $14.8 million. This reflected our net loss of $32.5 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $13.7 million, and a net decrease in our operating assets and liabilities of $4.0 million. Non-cash items primarily included $5.0 million of non-cash interest and financing related costs, $5.5 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $2.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, $0.7 million for loss on satellite deorbit and launch failure and $0.3 million of other miscellaneous items. The net decrease in operating assets and liabilities primarily included an increase of $1.1 million in contract assets and deferred contract costs, a decrease of $0.5 million in other long-term liabilities, and an increase of $0.4 million in accounts receivable. This was offset by an increase of $3.2 million in contract liabilities and an increase of $2.6 million in accounts payable and other accrued expenses.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThe cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to cash used for business acquisitions, the procurement, development, and deployment of capital assets, including satellites, ground stations, machinery and equipment, furniture, computer equipment and software, and leasehold improvements.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2021 was $120.8 million. This was driven by net $103.9 million of cash used in the exactEarth acquisition, $10.7 million of investment in our technology infrastructure and $4.7 million of investment in leasehold improvements, furniture, computer equipment, and machinery equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2020 was $10.4 million. This was primarily driven by $9.6 million of investment in our technology infrastructure and $0.7 million of investment in leasehold improvements, furniture, computer equipment, and machinery equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe cash flows from financing activities relate primarily to the Merger, debt, warrants and convertible note financings.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2021 was $270.5 million. This was primarily driven by $264.8 million of proceeds from the Merger, $70.5 million of proceeds from the FP and SIF loan transactions, $20.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, and $1.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, offset by payments of $31.8 million for merger and acquisitions costs related to the reverse recapitalization, repayments of $29.6 million to EIB and Eastward Capital, $19.9 million to settle the EIB warrants, and payments of $4.7 million for debt issuance costs related to the FP loan.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2020 was $16.6 million. This was primarily driven by $30.1 million of new loan proceeds net of issuance costs and $0.6 million of proceeds from convertible notes, offset by $14.1 million of re-payment on our existing loan facility.\nFor additional information regarding the terms of our credit facilities and notes, see Notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple solutions and services to a customer. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer solutions or services that are capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the solution or service either on its own or with other available resources, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the solution or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Determining whether solutions and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as a single performance obligation involves significant judgement that requires us to assess the nature of the promise and value delivered to the customer. Certain of our contracts contain multiple project-based solutions and services promised to a customer over various phases (e.g., scoping, development, manufacturing, testing, launch, and/or satellite operations), which we assess at contract inception to determine which of the solutions and services promised in a contract are distinct in order to identify individual performance obligations.\nFor contracts with more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations using the relative standalone selling price ( SSP\u201d) of each obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. SSP is generally estimated using cost plus a reasonable margin based on value added to the customer.\nFor certain project-based performance obligations, we recognize a portion of our revenue over time using the output method, specifically contract milestones, which we have determined to be the most direct and reasonable measure of progress as they reflect the results achieved and value transferred to the customer.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the valuation of intangible assets. Examples of critical estimates and assumptions in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future revenue growth, margins, customer retention rates, technology life, royalty rates, expected use of acquired assets, and discount rates. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets. These estimates are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recorded.\nContingent Earnout Liability\nIn connection with the Reverse Recapitalization and pursuant to the Merger Agreement, eligible Spire equity holders are entitled to receive additional shares of our Common Stock upon the achievement of certain Earnout Triggering Events. In accordance with ASC 815-40, the earnout shares are not indexed to the Common Stock and therefore are accounted for as a liability and an offset to Additional paid-in capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the reverse recapitalization date and subsequently remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recorded as a component of Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe contingent earnout liability is categorized as a Level 3 fair value measurement using the Monte Carlo model because the Company estimates projections during the Earnout Period utilizing unobservable inputs. Contingent earnout payments involve certain assumptions requiring significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. The assumptions utilized in the calculation are based on the achievement of certain stock price milestones, including the current price of our common stock, expected volatility, risk-free rate, expected term and dividend rate.\nWarrant Liability\nWe generally classify warrants for the purchase of shares of our common stock as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets unless the warrants meet certain specific criteria that require the warrants to be classified within stockholders' deficit. Those warrants accounted for as liabilities are freestanding financial instruments that may require us to transfer assets upon exercise. The warrant liability is initially recorded at fair value upon the date of issuance of each warrant and is subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. The fair value of the Public Warrants is based on quoted market prices and is classified as a Level 1 financial instrument. The fair value of the Private Warrants is estimated using the Black-Scholes model with inputs that include the Company's stock price in an actively traded market, making this fair value classified as a Level 2 financial instrument. The other significant assumptions used in the model are the exercise price, expected term, volatility, interest rate, and dividend yield.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have an equity incentive plan under which we grant stock-based awards to employees and non-employees. We account for stock-based awards in accordance with ASC 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense, based on estimated fair values, for all stock-based awards made to employees and non-employees for stock options.\nWe recognize the cost of stock-based awards granted to our employees and non-employees based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. For Restricted Stock Units (\"RSU\") with service-based vesting conditions, the fair value is calculated based upon the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant using the intrinsic value method. We determine the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is impacted by the following assumptions:\n\u2022Common Stock Valuation-Prior to our Closing Date of the Merger, determining the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying our stock-based awards, which were not publicly traded, involved significant judgment and had historically been determined with the help of an independent third-party valuation firm. For awards granted subsequent to the Closing Date, the fair value of our common stock is based on the closing price of our common stock, as reported on the NYSE, on the date of grant.\n\u2022Expected Term-We use the weighted average period that the stock options are expected to remain outstanding based on historical experience.\n\u2022Expected Volatility-As our stock was not publicly traded prior to the Closing, the volatility is based on a benchmark analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies.\n\u2022Expected Dividend Yield-The dividend rate used is zero as we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.\n\u2022Risk-Free Interest Rate-The interest rates used are based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.\nCommon Stock Valuation\nHistorically, for all periods prior to the Merger, since there has been no public market of our common stock, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying our share-based awards was estimated on each grant date by our board of directors. To determine the fair value of our common stock underlying option grants, our board of directors considered, among other things, input from management, valuations of our common stock prepared by unrelated third-party valuation firms in accordance with the guidance provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 2013 Practice Aid, Valuation of\nPrivately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, and our board of directors' assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant, and factors that may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022our results of operations and financial position, including the present value of expected future cash flows and the value of tangible and intangible assets;\n\u2022risks and opportunities relevant to our business;\n\u2022the status of platform development activities;\n\u2022our business conditions and projections;\n\u2022the market value of companies engaged in a substantially similar business;\n\u2022the lack of marketability of our common stock as a private company;\n\u2022the prices at which we sold shares of our convertible preferred stock to outside investors in arms-length transactions;\n\u2022the rights, preferences, and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock;\n\u2022the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for our securityholders, such as an initial public offering or a sale of the company, given prevailing market conditions;\n\u2022the hiring of key personnel and the experience of management; and\n\u2022trends and developments in our industry, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor valuations performed prior to December 31, 2020, we used the option pricing method, ( OPM\u201d), back-solve method. In an OPM framework, the backsolve method for inferring the equity value implied by a recent financing transaction involves making assumptions for the expected time to liquidity, volatility and risk-free rate and then solving for the value of equity such that value for the most recent financing equals the amount paid. This method was selected due to our stage and uncertainty regarding the timing and probability of possible future exit scenarios.\nFor valuations performed from January 1, 2021 to the Merger, we used a hybrid method of the OPM and the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method ( PWERM\u201d). PWERM considers various potential liquidity outcomes. Our approach included the use of an initial public offering scenario, a strategic merger or sale scenario, and a scenario assuming continued operation as a private entity. Under the hybrid OPM and PWERM method, the per share value calculated under the OPM and PWERM are weighted based on expected exit outcomes specific to each allocation methodology to arrive at a final estimated fair value per share of the common stock before a discount for lack of marketability is applied.\nFollowing the Closing, we have used the market closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the NYSE.\nAccounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted and Not Yet Adopted\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that we are (i) no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.\nSmaller Reporting Company Status\nAdditionally, we are a smaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (i) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as\nof the prior June 30, or (ii) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock\nheld by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nIn connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.

The total outstanding principal amount of the FP Term Loan will be due and payable at maturity on April 15, 2026. We may prepay the outstanding principal amount of the FP Term Loan at any time, in full but not in part. In addition, since the FP Lenders elected to exercise their conversion right in connection with the Merger, there is no premium or other contractual return in a prepayment. The aggregate amount required to be repaid in a prepayment to the FP Lenders would only be the outstanding principal amount of the FP Term Loan and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

Upon funding in May 2021, the FP Term Loan was used (i) to pay off our existing credit facilities with Eastward Fund Management, LLC (the Eastward Loan Facility\u201d) and European Investment Bank (the EIB Loan Facility\u201d), and (ii) to fund working capital and for general corporate purposes. We incurred $12.3 million of debt issuance costs relating to the FP Term Loan.\nOur obligations under the finance contract were guaranteed by our material subsidiaries, as determined in accordance with the finance contract, and were secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of the borrower. The finance contract contained customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limited our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, dispose of assets, consummate mergers or acquisitions, make investments, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens or pay dividends or other distributions on our capital stock, subject in each case to customary exceptions and qualifications.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nInterest Expense. Interest Expense includes interest costs associated with our promissory and convertible notes, and amortization of deferred financing costs.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect income tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and\n\u2022the lack of marketability of our common stock as a private company;\n\u2022Change in fair value of warrant liabilities and contingent earnout liabilities.

Some of our customer arrangements include the delivery of specific performance obligations and subsequent customer acceptance of project-based deliverables, which may impact the timing of revenue recognition. Subscription periods for our solutions generally range from one to two years and are typically non-cancelable, with customers having the right to terminate their agreements only if we materially breach our obligations under the agreement.

The four forms of data we monetize are:\n\u2022Amortization of purchased intangibles. Spire incurs amortization expense for purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies. Amortization of intangible assets is a non-cash expense and is inconsistent in amount and frequency because it is significantly affected by the timing, size of acquisitions and the inherent subjective nature of purchase price allocations. Because these costs have already been incurred and cannot be recovered, and are non-cash expenses, Spire excludes these expenses for its internal management reporting processes. Spire's management also finds it useful to exclude these charges when assessing the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to Spire's revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to Spire's future period revenues as well.\nExpansion of and Further Penetration of Our Customer Base\n\u2022Solutions: Data-driven actionable recommendations to solve specific business problems, utilizing the full spectrum of our data analytics suite.\n\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2020 %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to cash used for business acquisitions, the procurement, development, and deployment of capital assets, including satellites, ground stations, machinery and equipment, furniture, computer equipment and software, and leasehold improvements.\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities increased by $1.4 million, driven by the mark-to-market adjustment to reflect the fair market valuation of our public and private warrants. For additional information, see Notes 2, 10 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and development expenses increased $10.8 million, or 52%. $0.7 million of this growth was due to the addition of exactEarth operating costs, retention and stock acceleration expenses. Organic increases were primarily driven by an increase in personnel costs of $7.8 million, an increase in third-party services of $1.2 million, an increase in computing costs of $1.0 million and a $0.1 million increase in other operating expenses. The increase in personnel costs was driven by growth in headcount during the period. The increase in computing costs were driven by additional testing, modeling, and storage requirements used to develop new solutions. The increase in third-party services was driven by external technical resources required to support new development processes and capabilities.\nIn connection with the Reverse Recapitalization and pursuant to the Merger Agreement, eligible Spire equity holders are entitled to receive additional shares of our Common Stock upon the achievement of certain Earnout Triggering Events. In accordance with ASC 815-40, the earnout shares are not indexed to the Common Stock and therefore are accounted for as a liability and an offset to Additional paid-in capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the reverse recapitalization date and subsequently remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recorded as a component of Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDue to the nature of these events, we cannot predict the magnitude or frequency of future satellite deorbit and launch failure losses. While we sometimes purchase launch insurance when financially practical, the proceeds from these policies will typically only cover a portion of our loss in the event of an unplanned satellite deorbit or launch failure.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the loss on satellite deorbit and launch failure and does not reflect the cash capital expenditure requirements for the replacements of lost satellites. While these expenses could occur in a given year, the existence and magnitude of these costs could vary greatly and is unpredictable.\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,312\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32,504\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation & amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,839\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on satellite deorbit and launch failure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in fair value of contingent earnout liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(67,026\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in fair value of warrant liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(626\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Mergers and acquisition related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other unusual one-time costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other acquisition accounting amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(37,518\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,639\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes our net cash used in operating activities, net cash used in investing activities, and net cash provided by financing activities for the periods indicated:\nFor the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the following items provides information that is helpful in understanding our results of operations, evaluating our future prospects, comparing our financial results across accounting periods, and comparing our financial results to our peers, many of which provide similar non-GAAP financial measures.\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2020 %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ARR Customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>299\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ARR Solution Customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $28.0 million, or 223%. $2.2 million of this growth was due to the addition of exactEarth operating costs, retention and stock acceleration expenses. Organic increases were primarily driven by an increase in professional and consulting fees of $14.3 million, an increase in personnel costs of $7.1 million, an increase in business insurance of $2.7 million, an increase in facilities expenses of $0.8 million, an increase of $0.5 million in software expenses, and other miscellaneous operating expenses of $0.4 million. The increase in professional and consulting fees was primarily driven by accounting, legal and other consulting services associated with the Merger, company readiness for going public and the exactEarth acquisition. The increase in personnel costs was driven by stock-based compensation expense associated with a performance-based equity incentive program as well as overall headcount growth. The increase in business insurance was driven by incremental exposure associated with being a public company. The increase in facilities expenses was driven by an increase in office rent driven by expansion into new office space to accommodate our headcount growth. The increase in software expenses was driven by scaling to support overall company headcount growth.\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2020 %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Headcount (at end of period)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Business Metrics\nTable 7: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2020 %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ARR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor certain project-based performance obligations, we recognize a portion of our revenue over time using the output method, specifically contract milestones, which we have determined to be the most direct and reasonable measure of progress as they reflect the results achieved and value transferred to the customer.\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2020 %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Headcount (at period end)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following table summarizes the number of our ARR Customers and ARR Solution Customers at each fiscal year end for the periods indicated:\nInterest income was immaterial.\nOur business strategy may include, like our November 2021 acquisition of exactEarth, acquiring other complementary solutions, technologies, or businesses that we believe will allow us to reduce the time or costs required to develop new technologies, incorporate enhanced functionality into and complement our existing solution offerings, augment our engineering workforce, and enhance our technological capabilities.\nFor valuations performed prior to December 31, 2020, we used the option pricing method, ( OPM\u201d), back-solve method. In an OPM framework, the backsolve method for inferring the equity value implied by a recent financing transaction involves making assumptions for the expected time to liquidity, volatility and risk-free rate and then solving for the value of equity such that value for the most recent financing equals the amount paid. This method was selected due to our stage and uncertainty regarding the timing and probability of possible future exit scenarios.\nThe finance contract included customary events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of covenants or representations and warranties, cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events and a material adverse change event of default, subject to grace periods in certain instances. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, EIB had the right to declare all or a portion of the outstanding obligations to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the finance contract. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate would have applied on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the finance contract at a per annum rate equal to 2% above the otherwise applicable interest rate.\nOur contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple solutions and services to a customer. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer solutions or services that are capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the solution or service either on its own or with other available resources, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the solution or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Determining whether solutions and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as a single performance obligation involves significant judgement that requires us to assess the nature of the promise and value delivered to the customer. Certain of our contracts contain multiple project-based solutions and services promised to a customer over various phases (e.g., scoping, development, manufacturing, testing, launch, and/or satellite operations), which we assess at contract inception to determine which of the solutions and services promised in a contract are distinct in order to identify individual performance obligations.\nCOVID-19 Impact\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 to 2020 %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ARR Net Retention Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Income (Expense)\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(57,986\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,773\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(119,479\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,415\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>270,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur largest source of operating cash inflows is cash collections from our customers.

Spire incurs amortization expense for purchased data rights in connection with the acquisition of exactEarth and certain technologies. Amortization of this asset is a non-cash expense that can be significantly affected by the inherent subjective nature of the assigned value and useful life. Because this cost has already been incurred and cannot be recovered, and is a non-cash expense, Spire excludes this expense for its internal management reporting processes. Spire's management also finds it useful to exclude this charge when assessing the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted for loss on satellite deorbit and launch failure, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, change in value of contingent earnout liability, other (expense) income, net, stock-based compensation, other acquisition accounting amortization, mergers and acquisition related costs and expenses, and other unusual one-time costs. We believe Adjusted EBITDA can be useful in providing an understanding of the underlying operating results and trends and an enhanced overall understanding of our financial performance and prospects for the future. While Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measure under GAAP, management uses this financial measure to evaluate and forecast business performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements, such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments, and tax payments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our use of the term Adjusted EBITDA may vary from the use of similarly titled measures by others in our industry due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation.\nSales and Marketing\n\u2022ARR Net Retention Rate\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nWe have an equity incentive plan under which we grant stock-based awards to employees and non-employees. We account for stock-based awards in accordance with ASC 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense, based on estimated fair values, for all stock-based awards made to employees and non-employees for stock options.\n\nWarrant Liability\nChange in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities. Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities includes mark-to-market adjustments to reflect changes in fair value of warrant liabilities.\n\u2022Risk-Free Interest Rate-The interest rates used are based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.\nEIB Loan Facility\nSmaller Reporting Company Status\nThe Eastward Loan Facility included customary events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of covenants or representations and warranties, an investor abandonment default, cross- defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events and judgment defaults, subject to grace periods in certain instances. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, Eastward had the right to declare all or a portion of the outstanding obligations payable by us to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the loan agreement. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate would have applied on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the loan agreement at a per annum rate equal to 5% above the otherwise applicable interest rate.\nConvertible Notes\nOur platform applies our value-add insights and predictive analytics to this proprietary data to create commercially valuable datasets.

As we continue to invest in our growth, including through hiring additional personnel, we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars as revenue grows; however, we expect our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to decrease over time.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related expenses for personnel in our executive, finance and accounting, facilities, legal, human resources, global supply chain, and management information systems functions, as well as other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees related to third-party legal counsel, fees related to accounting, tax and audit costs, office facilities costs, software subscription costs, and other corporate costs.\nOver time, we expect the mix of our total revenues in the Americas and APAC to continue to increase with additional sales and marketing focus in those regions.\nThese value-add data features allow customers to solve various use cases and provide a path to expand throughout the customer's relationship.\nFor more details on the Merger, including all equity conversions, please see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022the prices at which we sold shares of our convertible preferred stock to outside investors in arms-length transactions;\nAs part of our acquisition of exactEarth in November 2021, we assumed a loan agreement with the Strategic Innovation Fund (\"SIF\") which was recorded at fair value of the debt. As of December 31, 2021, $4.5 million was included in Long-term debt, non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under this agreement and subsequent amendment, we are eligible to receive funding for certain expenditures incurred from February 13, 2018 to May 12, 2023, up to a maximum of $5.7 million.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\u2022risks and opportunities relevant to our business;\nNet cash used in operating activities in fiscal year 2020 was $14.8 million. This reflected our net loss of $32.5 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $13.7 million, and a net decrease in our operating assets and liabilities of $4.0 million. Non-cash items primarily included $5.0 million of non-cash interest and financing related costs, $5.5 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $2.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, $0.7 million for loss on satellite deorbit and launch failure and $0.3 million of other miscellaneous items. The net decrease in operating assets and liabilities primarily included an increase of $1.1 million in contract assets and deferred contract costs, a decrease of $0.5 million in other long-term liabilities, and an increase of $0.4 million in accounts receivable. This was offset by an increase of $3.2 million in contract liabilities and an increase of $2.6 million in accounts payable and other accrued expenses.\nThe following table summarizes our ARR Net Retention Rate at each fiscal year end for the periods indicated (excludes exactEarth):\nInterest expense increased $4.6 million, or 69%, primarily as a result of incurring higher interest charges associated with our EIB, Eastward and FP loan facilities as discussed below.\nThe Eastward Loan Facility bore interest at a rate of 11.75% per annum, payable monthly in arrears. We were also required to pay a commitment fee equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of each term loan borrowing. Following an interest only period of 24 months, the principal amount of each term loan was repayable in 24 equal monthly installments based on an amortization period of 36 months. The outstanding principal amount of each term loan, plus a repayment fee equal to 2.00% of the original $15.0 million principal amount of such term loan, was due and payable 48 months after such borrowing.\n\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those set forth in the sections titled Risk Factors\u201d and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Our fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are referred to herein as fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020, respectively. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d and similar terms refer to Spire and its subsidiaries.\nWe provide our solutions to global customers through a subscription model or project-based solutions. We currently sell directly to end customers and utilize reseller partners when beneficial.\nAcquisition of exactEarth\nheld by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.\n\n\u2022Other (expense) income, net. We exclude other (expense) income, net because it includes one-time and other items that do not reflect the underlying operational results of our business.\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the valuation of intangible assets. Examples of critical estimates and assumptions in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future revenue growth, margins, customer retention rates, technology life, royalty rates, expected use of acquired assets, and discount rates. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets. These estimates are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recorded.\nFor valuations performed from January 1, 2021 to the Merger, we used a hybrid method of the OPM and the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method ( PWERM\u201d). PWERM considers various potential liquidity outcomes. Our approach included the use of an initial public offering scenario, a strategic merger or sale scenario, and a scenario assuming continued operation as a private entity. Under the hybrid OPM and PWERM method, the per share value calculated under the OPM and PWERM are weighted based on expected exit outcomes specific to each allocation methodology to arrive at a final estimated fair value per share of the common stock before a discount for lack of marketability is applied.\nWhile we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to grow in absolute dollars in the future, primarily due to increased employee-related expenses as we grow our headcount, to support our sales and marketing efforts and our continued expansion of our sales capacity across our solutions, we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue to decrease in future periods as our revenue growth exceeds our growth in sales and marketing spend.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nThe contingent earnout liability is categorized as a Level 3 fair value measurement using the Monte Carlo model because the Company estimates projections during the Earnout Period utilizing unobservable inputs. Contingent earnout payments involve certain assumptions requiring significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. The assumptions utilized in the calculation are based on the achievement of certain stock price milestones, including the current price of our common stock, expected volatility, risk-free rate, expected term and dividend rate.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022trends and developments in our industry, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022our results of operations and financial position, including the present value of expected future cash flows and the value of tangible and intangible assets;\nWe believe that our current and future performance are dependent on many factors, including, but not limited to, those described below. While these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to achieve successful results. For additional information about these risks, see the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d If we are unable to address these risks, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThere are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures because non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures provided by other companies.\nGovernment Loan\nof the prior June 30, or (ii) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock\n\u2022Smart data: Clean data fused with third-party datasets and proprietary analysis to enhance value and provide insights;\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and the world and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. While we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic or any resurgences of the pandemic locally or globally, our compliance with these measures has impacted our day-to-day operations and could continue to disrupt our business and operations, as well as that of certain of our customers whose industries are more severely impacted by these measures, for an indefinite period of time. Through fiscal year 2021, we have experienced adverse changes in customer buying behavior that began in March 2020 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including decreased customer engagement, delayed sales cycles, and deterioration in near-term demand. In 2021, the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19 became the dominant strains in numerous countries around the world, including the United States, and are believed to be more contagious than other previously identified COVID-19 strains. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced delays and re-work due to third party satellite launch providers schedule shifts, delays and increased expenses in our hiring process, some attrition from adjusting company policies due to the COVID-19 pandemic and additional time and expenses supporting customer contracts. Despite these headwinds, we experienced an increase in revenue for fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020.\nImpact of Foreign Exchange Rates\n\n\nCost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs, depreciation, hosted infrastructure and high-power computing costs, third-party operating and royalty costs associated with delivering our data and services to our customers, and amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the exactEarth acquisition. Personnel costs are primarily related to the cost of our employees supporting and managing our constellation operations including satellite operations, ground station control and launch management. Costs associated with the manufacture and launch of our satellites, including personnel costs, are capitalized and depreciated upon placement in service, typically over a three year expected useful life. As satellites reach their expected end of useful life, they are generally replaced with replenishment satellites to maintain our constellation at optimal performance. Costs associated with the acquisition and development of new ground stations, including the bill of materials and labor to install the ground station, are capitalized and depreciated upon placement in service typically over a four-year expected useful life. We anticipate ongoing capital spending to repair and replenish ground stations as they reach their end of useful life to keep our ground station network at optimal performance. Our proprietary ground station network is primarily located in third-party locations where we incur lease and other operational charges. Cost of revenue also includes royalties associated with third-party data sets that we integrate into our data solutions.\nCustomer contracts for data trials and one-time transactions are excluded from the calculation of ARR.\nLimitations on the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\u2022The presentation of non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors should read this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto also included within.\n\u2022Expected Term-We use the weighted average period that the stock options are expected to remain outstanding based on historical experience.\nThe following table outlines the reconciliation from net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we issued additional convertible notes with a cumulative principal amount of $20.0 million, with maturities of January and February 2025, respectively, which converted into our Class A common stock at the Closing. In April 2021, we entered into the FP Credit Agreement (as defined and further described below), utilizing a portion of those funds to pay-off our existing credit arrangements with EIB and Eastward. In November 2021, we closed our acquisition of exactEarth for the purchase price of $129.0 million, consisting of $109.6 million in cash and $22.3 million of common stock, net of $3.0 million post-combination expense.\nLoss on Satellite Deorbit and Launch Failure\nOther (Expense) Income, Net. Other (Expense) Income, Net consists primarily of tax credits, grant income, the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses, benefit from loan forgiveness, loss on debt extinguishment, and sales and local taxes. We use the local currency as our functional currency for Luxembourg, United Kingdom, Singapore and Canada.\n\u2022the rights, preferences, and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock;\nThe FP Lenders were also entitled to a commitment fee of $1.75 million that was fully earned and paid upon signing the FP Credit Agreement. The FP Term Loan bears interest at a rate of 9.00% per annum. Prior to the Merger, the FP Term Loan bore interest at a rate of 8.50% per annum. Since the FP Lenders elected to exercise their conversion right in connection with the Merger, and we chose not to prepay the remaining, non-converted outstanding principal amount of the FP Term Loan at the closing of such transaction, our interest rate under the FP Term Loan increased to 9.0% per annum.\nOur ARR Net Retention Rate can be impacted from period to period by large increases or decreases in customer contract value and large decreases in contract value from customers that have chosen not to renew their contracts with us. An ARR Net Retention Rate greater than 100% is an indication that we are growing the value of the solutions our customers are purchasing from us from a fiscal period end versus the prior fiscal period end. An ARR Net Retention Rate less than 100% is an indication that we are reducing the value of the solutions our customers are purchasing from us from a fiscal period end versus the prior fiscal period end. For fiscal year 2021, our ARR Net Retention Rate decreased 29% from fiscal year 2020. This decrease was driven by the growth in our ARR renewable base, a higher concentration of new customer ARR versus upsell, and delays in certain Space Services contracts that caused the contract value to spread over a longer period.\nThe following tables set forth selected Consolidated Statements of Operations data and such data as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods indicated:\nOperating Expenses\n\u2022the status of platform development activities;\nOur obligations under the Eastward Loan Facility were guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries, as determined in accordance with the loan agreement, and were secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of the co-borrowers. The loan agreement contained customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limited our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, dispose of assets, consummate mergers or acquisitions, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, pay dividends or other distributions on our capital stock, make investments and enter into transactions with affiliates, subject in each case to customary exceptions and qualifications.\n\nAs our fourth solution, we are also pioneering an innovative business model through our Space Services solution. We leverage our fully deployed infrastructure and large-scale operations to enable our customers to obtain customized data through our API. Our customers can begin receiving data in less than a year after engaging with us and receive data by entering into a subscription agreement. Our Space Services offering provides our customers with fast, scalable and reliable access to space.\nIn November 2021, we closed our acquisition of exactEarth for the purchase price of $129.0 million, consisting of $109.6 million in cash and $22.3 million of common stock, net of $3.0 million post-combination expense. The acquisition of exactEarth accelerates growth of our existing maritime business with additional data solutions, cross-selling opportunities, and expansion of our geographic footprint. exactEarth is now a fully-owned subsidiary of Spire Global, Inc. and will continue to conduct operations from Cambridge, Ontario, Canada.\nTotal revenue increased $14.9 million, or 52%, driven primarily by the growth in the number of ARR Customers combined with our ARR Net Retention Rate greater than 100%. The exactEarth acquisition added $1.5 million of revenue in fiscal year 2021. Our organic ARR Customers increased 61%, from 144 as of fiscal year 2020 to 232 as of fiscal year 2021, which contributed to an increase in revenue from new customers. Our organic ARR Net Retention Rate was 110% during fiscal year 2021, which contributed to an increase in revenue from our existing customer base.\nFor fiscal year 2021, we derived 48% of our revenue from Europe, Middle East, Africa ( EMEA\u201d), 36% of our revenue from the Americas and 16% of our revenue from Asia Pacific ( APAC\u201d). For fiscal year 2020, we derived 50% of our revenue from EMEA, 38% of our revenue from the Americas, and 12% of our revenue from APAC. For fiscal year 2021, we derived 47% of our revenue from subscription arrangements, compared to 27% for fiscal year 2020. This percentage mix can fluctuate significantly from period to period driven primarily by the timing of the non-subscription revenue recognition in our contracts.\n\u2022Maritime: Precise space-based data used for highly accurate ship monitoring, ship safety and route optimization.\nWe define an ARR Customer as an entity that has a contract with us or through our reseller partners contracts, that is either a binding and renewable agreement for our subscription solutions, or a binding multi-year contract as of the measurement date independent of the number of solutions the entity has under contract. A single organization with separate subsidiaries, segments, or divisions may represent multiple customers, as we treat each entity that is invoiced separately as an individual customer. In cases where customers subscribe to our platform through our reseller partners, each end customer that meets the above definition is counted separately as an ARR Customer. All entities that have contracts for data trials and one-time transactions are excluded from the calculation of ARR Customers.\n\u2022Clean data: Clean and structured data directly from our proprietary nanosatellites;\n\u2022Expected Dividend Yield-The dividend rate used is zero as we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.\nIn response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we initially implemented plans to manage our costs. In fiscal year 2020, for part of the year, we temporarily limited the addition of new employees and third-party contracted services, curtailed most travel expenses except where critical to the business, and acted to limit discretionary spending. As we obtained further visibility on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we lifted some of these limitations to support our growth. Although we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance become available, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and/or the precautionary measures that we, our customers and governmental authorities have adopted have resulted in, and could continue to result in, customers not purchasing or renewing our solutions or services, delays or lengthening of our sales cycles, and reductions in average transaction sizes, and could negatively affect our customer success and sales and marketing efforts, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business and operating results. Because our solutions have future obligations and a portion of that revenue is recognized over time, the effect of the pandemic may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. Our competitors could experience similar or different impacts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could result in changes to our competitive landscape. While we have developed and continue to develop plans to help mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on our business, these efforts may not be effective, and any protracted economic downturn could significantly affect our business and operating results. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our business. For additional information regarding the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d\nWhile we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to grow in absolute dollars in future periods as our employee-related expenses increase to support our revenue growth and we have increased expenses from being a public company, we expect our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to decrease as revenue growth exceeds our growth in general and administrative spend.\n\u2022Stock-based compensation. We exclude stock-based compensation expenses primarily because they are non-cash expenses that we exclude from our internal management reporting processes. We also find it useful to exclude these expenses when we assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FASB ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation ( ASC 718\u201d), we believe excluding stock-based compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business results of operations and those of other companies.\n\u2022We had 255 organic ARR Solution Customers under contract and added 343 from exactEarth, ending the fourth quarter with 598 ARR Solution Customers, a 288% increase year-over-year. For the definition of ARR Solution Customers, see the section titled -Key Business Metrics.\u201d\nComponents of Results of Operations\nIncome tax increased $0.1 million, or 24%, primarily driven by higher income tax in our United Kingdom subsidiary.\nOn August 16, 2021, we announced that we had closed our Merger with NavSight. As a result, we became a wholly owned subsidiary of NavSight, and NavSight changed its name to Spire Global, Inc.\u201d\nSales and marketing expenses increased $10.1 million, or 98%. $1.2 million of this growth was due to the addition of exactEarth operating costs, retention and stock acceleration expenses. Organic increases were primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $7.0 million, an increase in marketing and professional services costs of $1.4 million, an increase of $0.3 million in travel expenses and $0.2 million increase in other operating expenses. The increase in personnel costs was driven by growth in our headcount involved in selling activities. The increase in marketing and professional services costs was driven by growth in our expenditures for demand generation, brand awareness and public relations. The increase in travel expense was due to improved travel conditions following the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe cash flows from financing activities relate primarily to the Merger, debt, warrants and convertible note financings.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, sales commissions, marketing and advertising costs, costs incurred in the development of customer relationships, brand development costs, travel-related expenses and amortization of purchased intangible backlog associated with the exactEarth acquisition. Commission costs on new customer contract bookings are considered costs of obtaining customer contracts. Commission costs for multi-year deals are considered contract acquisition costs and are deferred and then amortized over the period of the contract excluding the last 12 months, which are expensed at the beginning of that final period. Commission costs on contracts completed with a term of twelve months or less are expensed in the period incurred.\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\n\u2022our business conditions and projections;\nWe define ARR as our expected annualized revenue from customers that are under contract with us at the end of the reporting period with a binding and renewable agreement for our subscription solutions, or a customer that has a binding multi-year contract that can range from components of our Space Services solution to a project-based customer solution. Project-based contracts or customers are considered recurring when they have signed a multi-year binding agreement that has a renewable component in the contract or a customer that has multiple contracts that we continue to have under contract over multiple years.\nProvision for income taxes consists of federal and certain state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions. We do not provide for income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since we intend to invest these earnings outside of the United States permanently. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.\nOther Income (Expense)\nIn connection with the Merger, we raised $264.8 million of proceeds including the contribution of $230.0 million of cash held in NavSight's trust account from its initial public offering, net of redemptions of NavSight public stockholders of $210.2 million, and $245.0 million of cash in connection with the PIPE Investment. We incurred $38.7 million of merger and acquisitions costs, consisting of banking, legal, and other professional fees, of which $32.1 million was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital, and the remaining $6.6 million was expensed to general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nWe generally classify warrants for the purchase of shares of our common stock as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets unless the warrants meet certain specific criteria that require the warrants to be classified within stockholders' deficit. Those warrants accounted for as liabilities are freestanding financial instruments that may require us to transfer assets upon exercise. The warrant liability is initially recorded at fair value upon the date of issuance of each warrant and is subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. The fair value of the Public Warrants is based on quoted market prices and is classified as a Level 1 financial instrument. The fair value of the Private Warrants is estimated using the Black-Scholes model with inputs that include the Company's stock price in an actively traded market, making this fair value classified as a Level 2 financial instrument. The other significant assumptions used in the model are the exercise price, expected term, volatility, interest rate, and dividend yield.\nIn December 2020, we entered into a line of credit agreement with Eastward and certain of our subsidiaries as co-borrowers (the Eastward Loan Facility\u201d). The agreement provided for a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25.0 million, of which we borrowed $15.0 million. We used the proceeds to prepay existing indebtedness and the remaining proceeds were available to be used for general corporate purposes. In connection with funding the term loan under the FP Credit Agreement, we repaid the outstanding obligations under the Eastward Loan Facility, including a prepayment premium and fees of $0.8 million.\nAs our solutions have grown, we continue to focus on further penetration of our initial industries including maritime, aviation, logistics and government (civil and defense/intelligence) among others. We believe our technology and solutions give us the ability to also expand into additional industries, including energy, financial services, agriculture, transportation, and insurance, and geographies, including Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. Our revenue growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand into new industries and geographies. The costs associated with these expansions may adversely affect our results of operations.\nFollowing the Closing, we have used the market closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the NYSE.\nWe expect that our principal sources of liquidity will be the proceeds received from the Merger, the additional convertible notes issued and the FP Term Loan (as defined below). We believe this will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support solution development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the ongoing investments in technology infrastructure, the introduction of new and enhanced solutions, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures, strategic initiatives or investments and our ongoing operations. In the event that we decide, or are required, to seek additional financing from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, third-party consulting fees, and computing costs. Our research and development efforts are focused on improving our satellite technology, developing new data sets, developing new algorithms and enhancing our smart and predictive analytics, and enhancing the ease of use and utility of our space-based data solutions.\nIn fiscal year 2021, we incurred no expense in this category compared to fiscal year 2020, where we experienced the loss of two satellites due to a third-party deployment issue associated with a single launch.\nAcquisitions\nFor additional detail regarding the terms associated with the exactEarth acquisition, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur ARR Customer and ARR Solution Customer growth in the periods presented have been driven by landing new ARR Customers across our four solutions (Maritime, Aviation, Weather and Space Services) and expanding our geographical footprint, along with having a low number of customers who have chosen not to renew their contracts with us. We believe that our ability to expand our customer base is a key indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business, and our future potential business opportunities.\nWe employ a land and expand\u201d business model that focuses on efficiently acquiring new customers ( land\u201d) and then growing our relationships with these customers over time ( expand\u201d). We have the capability to offer customers additional data sets and a variety of enhanced features that potentially grow the value of the services our customers contract with us. Our future revenue growth and our path to profitability are dependent upon our ability to continue to land new customers and then expand adoption of our solutions within their organizations.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2021 was $120.8 million. This was driven by net $103.9 million of cash used in the exactEarth acquisition, $10.7 million of investment in our technology infrastructure and $4.7 million of investment in leasehold improvements, furniture, computer equipment, and machinery equipment.\nIncome Taxes\n\n\u2022the hiring of key personnel and the experience of management; and\nWe continue investing in growing our business and capitalizing on our market opportunity while balancing the uncertainties from the COVID-19 pandemic. We intend to continue to add headcount to our global sales and marketing teams to acquire new customers and to increase sales to existing customers and we intend to continue to add headcount to our research and development teams and otherwise invest to improve and innovate our nanosatellite, ground station and data analytics technologies. For fiscal year 2021, our spending on research and development increased by $10.9 million, or 52%, from fiscal year 2020, which included $0.3 million from the exactEarth acquisition. For fiscal year 2021, our sales and marketing expenses increased by $10.1 million, or 98%, from fiscal year 2020, which included $0.6 million from the exactEarth acquisition. Our total headcount across all functions has increased from 251 employees as of December 31, 2020, to 370 employees as of December 31, 2021, which increase includes 33 exactEarth employees. We believe that these investments will contribute to our long-term growth. The costs of these investments may adversely affect our operating results.\nIncome Tax Provision\n\u2022EBITDA. We define EBITDA as net income (loss), plus depreciation and amortization expense, plus interest expense, and plus the provision for (or minus benefit from) income taxes.\nPrivately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, and our board of directors' assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant, and factors that may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. These factors include, but are not limited to:\nWe calculate our ARR Net Retention Rate for a particular fiscal period end by dividing (i) our ARR from those ARR Customers that were also customers as of the last day of the prior fiscal period end by (ii) the ARR from all customers as of the last day of the prior fiscal period. This calculation measures the overall impact from increases in customer contract value (upsells), the decreases in customer contract value (downsells), and the decreases in customer value resulting from customers that have chosen not to renew their contracts with us.\nground stations or fulfill its intended technical mission for a duration greater than one month. The loss amount is presented net of any insurance claims received. We did not incur any of these expenses in fiscal year 2021. We incurred $0.7 million in expenses in fiscal year 2020.\nGross margin for fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020 was 57% and 64%, respectively. The decrease in fiscal year 2021 gross margin compared to fiscal year 2020 was driven primarily by higher depreciation, computing expenses, royalties, and strategic customer expenses as described above. This metric can fluctuate significantly from period to period driven primarily by the timing of the revenue as well as the timing of our technology investments to support future revenue. The exactEarth acquisition negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 2%. Of this reduction, approximately half was driven by purchase accounting adjustments including reduction to exactEarth deferred revenue and amortization of purchased intangibles.\nWe report in U.S. dollars, and the functional currency of our foreign operating subsidiaries is the local currency, including the Euro, the British Pound, the Singapore Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. Many of these currencies have strengthened significantly against the U.S. dollar since fiscal year 2020. In fiscal year 2021, approximately 48% of our revenues were generated in non-U.S. dollar-denominated currencies respectively. This compares to fiscal year 2020 where approximately 50% of our revenues were generated in non-U.S. dollar-denominated currencies respectively. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the period for revenues and expenses. To the extent we experience significant currency fluctuations, our results of operations may be impacted.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nResults of Operations\nWe are a global provider of space-based data, analytics and space services, offering unique datasets and powerful insights about Earth from the ultimate vantage point-space-so that organizations can make decisions with confidence, accuracy and speed. We own and operate one of the world's largest multi-purpose satellite constellations in low earth orbit. Our fully deployed constellation consists of over 100 satellites and we believe it is also one of the world's largest listening\u201d constellations, observing the earth utilizing radio frequency sensors. We enrich this hard-to-acquire, valuable data with analytics and predictive solutions, providing data as a subscription to organizations around the world so that they can improve business operations, decrease their environmental footprint, deploy resources for growth and competitive advantage and mitigate risk.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which items are adjusted to calculate our non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our public disclosures. Some of these limitations are:\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n\u2022Expected Volatility-As our stock was not publicly traded prior to the Closing, the volatility is based on a benchmark analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nNavSight Merger\nWe track our progress landing new customers by measuring the number of ARR Solution Customers we have from one fiscal year to the next. For instance, we have increased our number of ARR Solution Customers from 154 for fiscal year 2020 to 598 for fiscal year 2021. We track our progress in expanding our customer relationships by measuring our ARR Net Retention Rate. For the definition of ARR Net Retention Rate, see the section titled -Key Business Metrics.\u201d Our organic ARR Net Retention Rate was 110% for fiscal year 2021 and 154% for fiscal year 2020.\n\u2022Common Stock Valuation-Prior to our Closing Date of the Merger, determining the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying our stock-based awards, which were not publicly traded, involved significant judgment and had historically been determined with the help of an independent third-party valuation firm. For awards granted subsequent to the Closing Date, the fair value of our common stock is based on the closing price of our common stock, as reported on the NYSE, on the date of grant.\nCommon Stock Valuation\nOther (expense) income, net increased $5.8 million, or 709%, primarily driven by $5.0 million in debt extinguishment expenses resulting from paying off the EIB Loan and the Eastward Loan Facilities, and an increase in realized and unrealized foreign exchange expense of $1.9 million, and $0.3 million of miscellaneous other expenses, offset by an increase of $1.7 million in grant income driven by the extinguishment of debt resulting from the U.S. government's forgiveness of our loan under the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES\u201d) Act.\nFP Credit Agreement\nThe FP Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of covenants or representations and warranties, cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events and judgment defaults, subject to grace periods in certain instances. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the FP Lenders may declare all or a portion of the outstanding obligations payable by us to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the FP Credit Agreement. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate will apply on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the FP Credit Agreement at a per annum rate equal to 2% above the otherwise applicable interest rate.\nLoss on Satellite Deorbit and Launch Failure. Loss on Satellite Deorbit and Launch Failure consists of the write-off of the remaining capitalized costs associated with the manufacture and launch of our satellites prior to the end of the satellite's useful life. We contract with third-party companies to launch, carry, and deploy our LEMUR satellites into space. A loss could result from a third-party launch or deployer failure, a technical failure of the satellite, or the deorbit of a satellite before the end of the satellite's useful life. A technical failure could include a satellite that is not able to communicate with our network of\nIn connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. For additional information, see the sections titled Risk Factors\u201d and Controls and Procedures.\u201d\n\u2022Full year 2021 revenue was $43.4 million, an increase of 52% from fiscal year 2020. Excluding the $1.5 million of revenue recognized from exactEarth during the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, full year 2021 revenue was $41.9 million, an increase of 47% from fiscal year 2020.\n\u2022Aviation: Precise space-based data used for highly accurate aircraft monitoring, aircraft safety and route optimization.\n\u2022ARR Customers\n\u2022Other unusual one-time costs. We exclude these as they are unusual items that do not reflect the ongoing operational\nFrom July 2019 through October 2020, we issued and sold subordinated convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $42.9 million (the 2019 Spire Notes\u201d). In May 2021, we agreed with the holders of the 2019 Spire Notes to extend the maturity date of all convertible promissory notes outstanding at December 31, 2020 from January 29, 2022 to July 31, 2022. From January 2021 through February 2021, we issued and sold subordinated convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $20.0 million, which mature four years from the date of issuance (the 2021 Spire Notes\u201d). The 2019 Spire Notes and the 2021 Spire Notes accrued interest at a rate of 8.0% per annum and converted into shares of our common stock in connection with the Closing, so they are no longer outstanding.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nInterest Income. Interest Income includes interest earned on our cash balances.\n\u2022Weather: Precise space-based data used for highly accurate weather forecasting.\nResearch and Development\nNet cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2020 was $16.6 million. This was primarily driven by $30.1 million of new loan proceeds net of issuance costs and $0.6 million of proceeds from convertible notes, offset by $14.1 million of re-payment on our existing loan facility.\nHighlights from Fiscal Year 2021\nUnder the terms of the EIB finance contract, on August 20, 2020, we issued to EIB a warrant exercisable for 454,899 shares (Tranche A) of Old Spire Common Stock at a price of $0.0001 per share. Upon completion of the Merger, the exercisable share count converted to 775,966. On October 29, 2020, we issued to EIB an additional warrant exercisable for 454,899 shares (Tranche B) of Old Spire Common Stock at a price of $0.0001 per share. Upon completion of the Merger, the exercisable share count converted to 775,966. Each such warrant included a put option, whereby EIB had the right to have us repurchase the warrants by paying EIB an amount equal to the then-current fair market value of the shares of Old Spire Common Stock for which the warrants were exercisable. The amount that we were required to pay upon the exercise of the put option was subject to a purchase price cap of EUR 10.0 million for each warrant. In September 2021, EIB submitted a notice of cancellation for the 775,966 EIB warrants (Tranche A). In October 2021, EIB submitted a notice of cancellation for the remaining 775,966 EIB warrants (Tranche B). The total settlement value associated with the EIB warrants was $19.9 million and was paid in November 2021. Upon settlement, $12.8 million was released from restricted cash which had been held in guarantee for EIB warrant redemption.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for our securityholders, such as an initial public offering or a sale of the company, given prevailing market conditions;\n\nWe review the following key business metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions:\nExpansion into New Industries and Geographies\nInvestment in Growth\nRevenue\nARR Customers grew by 431, or 299%. The addition of exactEarth added 343 ARR Customers. Our organic ARR Customer growth was 61%. ARR Solution Customers grew by 444. The addition of exactEarth added 343 ARR Solution Customers. Our organic ARR Solution Customer growth was 66%.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\n(1)Includes stock-based compensation as follows:\nContingent Earnout Liability\nWe believe that in addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our business, results of operations and financial condition. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and facilitates period to period comparisons of operations, as this eliminates the effects of certain variables from period to period for reasons that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance. In addition to our GAAP measures, we use this non-GAAP financial measure internally for budgeting and resource allocation purposes and in analyzing our financial results.\nARR Net Retention Rate\n\u2022On August 16, 2021, we completed the Merger with NavSight and received cash proceeds of $236.6 million and were listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol SPIR.\u201d\nRevenue\nOur solutions are offered to customers across numerous industries and we not only have the opportunity to upsell within each one, but we also have the opportunity to cross-sell among all our solutions.\nTo support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities, we have allowed many of our employees to work remotely. As of December 31, 2021, our employees are permitted to come into the office in accordance with all applicable local, State and Federal guidelines and regulations. Our offices will only remain open to the extent local, state and federal authorities permit us to do so and our own criteria and conditions to ensure employee\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2020 was $10.4 million. This was primarily driven by $9.6 million of investment in our technology infrastructure and $0.7 million of investment in leasehold improvements, furniture, computer equipment, and machinery equipment.\nFor contracts with more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations using the relative standalone selling price ( SSP\u201d) of each obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. SSP is generally estimated using cost plus a reasonable margin based on value added to the customer.\n$8.5 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $6.0 million of non-cash interest and debt issuance amortization expense, $2.3 million on debt extinguishment expense, $1.6 million on warrant liability revaluation, and $0.5 million of other non-cash expenses offset by $67.0 million non-cash gain on the contingent earnout liability revaluation. The net decrease in operating assets and liabilities primarily included an increase of $6.7 million in other current assets combined with a $5.0 million increase in accounts receivable. This was offset by an increase of $4.7 million in accrued wages and other expenses, a $2.3 million increase in accounts payable, a $2.2 million increase in other long term liabilities, and a $0.3 million increase in other non-cash assets and liabilities.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt;\nOur ARR growth in the periods presented has been driven by both landing new ARR Customers along with increasing the amount of business with our existing customers. This is reflected in the increase in the total number of ARR Customers as well as ARR Net Retention Rates that have been over 100% for the periods presented. Due in part to the timing of some of our project-based contracts, including when engagements start and stop, our ARR has fluctuated from period to period in the past, and we expect our ARR to fluctuate from period to period in the future. ARR is a leading indicator and accordingly will tend to outpace the revenue impact as we recognize the contract value over time.\nWe expect cost of revenue, including depreciation and amortization expenses, third-party operating costs and royalties, and high-powered computing costs, to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. Additionally, we expect the purchase accounting adjustments associated with the exactEarth acquisition, namely higher amortization expenses and lower deferred revenue, to grow in relative terms as we absorb the impact on a full year basis. These items will likely have a negative impact on gross margin for at least the near term.\n\u2022On November 30, 2021, we completed the acquisition of exactEarth for the purchase price of $129.0 million, consisting of $109.6 million in cash and $22.3 million of shares of our Class A common stock, net of $3.0 million post-combination expense.\nhealth and safety are satisfied, including social distancing and enhanced cleaning protocols. While we have developed plans for our employees to begin safely returning to their respective offices, we cannot predict when or how we will be able to completely lift the work from home requirements or other COVID-19 related restrictions for geographic areas that continue to be significantly impacted by the pandemic or certain other actions taken as part of our business continuity plans, including travel restrictions. We may also have to reinstate work from home requirements in response to further changes in local regulations in connection with developments in the COVID-19 pandemic. While the adjustments to our operations may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our solution development, sales, marketing, and customer support efforts, as of the date of this filing, we do not believe our work from home protocol has materially adversely impacted our internal controls, financial reporting systems or our operations.\nWe recognize the cost of stock-based awards granted to our employees and non-employees based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. For Restricted Stock Units (\"RSU\") with service-based vesting conditions, the fair value is calculated based upon the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant using the intrinsic value method. We determine the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is impacted by the following assumptions:\nFor additional detail regarding the terms associated with our financing arrangements, see Notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nresults of our business.\nOperating Expenses\nFor additional information regarding the terms of our credit facilities and notes, see Notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHistorically, for all periods prior to the Merger, since there has been no public market of our common stock, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying our share-based awards was estimated on each grant date by our board of directors. To determine the fair value of our common stock underlying option grants, our board of directors considered, among other things, input from management, valuations of our common stock prepared by unrelated third-party valuation firms in accordance with the guidance provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 2013 Practice Aid, Valuation of\nThe FP Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, pay dividends or other distributions on our capital stock, dispose of assets, consummate mergers or acquisitions and enter into transactions with affiliates, subject in each case to customary exceptions and qualifications. Prior to the consummation of a Qualifying IPO (as defined in the FP Credit Agreement), which includes the Merger, we were required to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, minimum unrestricted cash of at least $15.0 million, as determined in accordance with the FP Credit Agreement, provided that this covenant did not apply following any fiscal quarter in which we achieved positive EBITDA so long as we continued to maintain positive EBITDA in subsequent fiscal quarters. Since the Merger occurred, we are no longer required to maintain this financial covenant per the terms of the FP Credit Agreement.\n\u2022As of December 31, 2021, annual recurring revenue ( ARR\u201d) was $70.8 million, an increase of approximately 96% from December 31, 2020. Excluding the $18.5 million of ARR contributed by the acquisition of exactEarth, Spire's December 31, 2021 ARR was $52.3 million, an increase of 44% from December 31, 2020. For the definition of ARR, see the section titled -Key Business Metrics.\u201d\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nWe define an ARR Solution Customer similarly to an ARR Customer, but we count every solution the customer has with us separately. As a result, the count of ARR Solution Customers exceeds the count of ARR Customers in each year as some customers contract with us for multiple solutions. Our multiple solutions customers are those customers that are under contract for at least two of our solutions: Maritime, Aviation, Weather, and Space Services. All entities that have contracts for data trials and one-time transactions are excluded from the calculation of ARR Solution Customers.\nCost of revenue increased $8.4 million, or 82%, $1.7 million of this growth was due to the addition of exactEarth operating costs, retention and stock acceleration expenses. Organic increases were primarily driven by an increase in depreciation expense of $2.2 million, an increase in computing costs of $2.2 million, third party royalty costs increases of $1.0 million, $0.7 million of space services hardware expenses and $0.2 million higher personnel expenses, with the remainder in higher miscellaneous operating expenses. Depreciation expense increased from the prior period driven by continued additions to our constellation. The increase in computing costs were driven by higher expenses to support customer growth and some of our weather solutions transitioning from research and development to production. The increase in third party royalty costs was driven by an increase in sales activity, resulting in higher payments to third-party data set providers as they augment our data solutions. The increase in space services third-party hardware expenses was in support of a strategic customer commitment. The increase in personnel expenses was driven by headcount growth.\n\u2022Loss on satellite deorbit and launch failure. We exclude loss on satellite deorbit and launch failure because if there was no loss, the expense would be accounted for as depreciation and would also be excluded as part of our EBITDA calculation.\nChange in fair value of contingent earnout liability was $67.0 million, driven by the mark-to-market adjustment to reflect the fair market valuation of the underlying stock price. In connection with the Merger, eligible Spire equity holders are entitled to receive additional shares of our common stock upon our achievement of certain Earnout Triggering Events which are treated as liabilities and required to be marked to market each reporting period. Changes in valuation are recorded against the Contingent earnout liability account with the offsetting gain or loss recorded in Other Income (expense). For additional information, see Notes 2, 3 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor fiscal year 2021, our increase in the number of ARR Customers and our ARR Net Retention Rate greater than 100% was driven by our increased spending on sales and marketing activities, the geographical expansion of our sales efforts into new countries and/or regions and the development and rollout of new data solutions.\n\u2022the market value of companies engaged in a substantially similar business;\n\u2022ARR\n\u2022Predictive solutions: Big data, AI, and ML algorithms applied to fused data sets to create predictive analytics and insights; and\nOur principal sources of liquidity to fund our operations are from cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $109.3 million as of December 31, 2021, mainly from net proceeds from the Merger, borrowings available under the FP Term Loan (as defined below) and the issuance of convertible notes. Of this $109.3 million, approximately $11.6 million was held outside of the United States. These amounts compare to cash and cash equivalents of $15.6 million as of December 31, 2020, of which $5.2 million was held outside of the United States. These amounts are exclusive of restricted cash which totaled $0.4 million as of December 31, 2021, and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2020. Since our inception, we have been in an operating cash flow deficit as we have made significant investments in our technology infrastructure, built out our research and development foundation, grown sales and marketing resources to drive revenue, and scaled general and administrative functions to enable operating effectiveness.\nWe continue to experience foreign currency fluctuations as we re-measure foreign currency denominated transactions and balances into the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Our results of operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the Euro, British Pound, Singapore Dollar and Canadian Dollar. We may continue to experience favorable or adverse foreign currency exchange impacts due to volatility in these currencies relative to their respective functional currencies.\nIn December 2021, our satellite constellation covered the earth over 200 times per day on average and our global ground station network performed over 2,300 contacts each day on average, reliably and resiliently collecting data with low latency. Our cloud-based data infrastructure processed five terabytes of data each day on average in December 2021, in creating our proprietary data analytics solutions. We provide customers these solutions through an API infrastructure that delivers approximately one terabyte of data each day to our customers, as of December 31, 2021. The global data we collect includes data that can only be captured from space with no terrestrial alternatives. We collect this data once and can then sell it an unlimited number of times across a broad and growing set of industries, including weather, aviation and maritime, with global coverage, real-time and near real-time data that can be easily integrated into our customers' operations.\nWhile we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods primarily due to higher headcount as we continue to invest in the development of our solutions offerings and new technologies, we expect research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in future periods as our revenue growth exceeds our growth in research and development spend.\n\u2022ARR Solution Customers\nThe total outstanding principal amount of each tranche was due and payable five years after the borrowing date for such tranche. The initial tranche of EUR 5.0 million did not accrue interest. The second tranche of EUR 7.0 million accrued interest at a rate equal to EURIBOR plus 5.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. If borrowed, the third tranche of EUR 8.0 million would have accrued interest at a rate equal to EURIBOR plus 10.0% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. We were also required to pay a commitment fee equal to 1.00% per annum of the undrawn term loan commitments from the one-year anniversary of the finance contract through the expiration of the commitments in January 2023.\nNet cash used in operating activities in fiscal year 2021 was $58.0 million. This reflected our net loss of $19.3 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $36.3 million, and a net decrease in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.2 million. Non-cash items primarily included $11.6 million of stock-based compensation,\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2021 was $270.5 million. This was primarily driven by $264.8 million of proceeds from the Merger, $70.5 million of proceeds from the FP and SIF loan transactions, $20.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, and $1.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, offset by payments of $31.8 million for merger and acquisitions costs related to the reverse recapitalization, repayments of $29.6 million to EIB and Eastward Capital, $19.9 million to settle the EIB warrants, and payments of $4.7 million for debt issuance costs related to the FP loan.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Earnout Liability. Change in Fair Value of Contingent Earnout Liability includes mark-to-market adjustments to reflect changes in fair value of the contingent earnout liability.\nStock-Based Compensation\nAnnual Recurring Revenue\nAdditionally, we are a smaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (i) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as", "item_7_text": "Interest on the FP Term Loan is payable quarterly in arrears. The total outstanding principal amount of the FP Term Loan will be due and payable at maturity on April 15, 2026. We may prepay the outstanding principal amount of the FP Term Loan at any time, in full but not in part. In addition, since the FP Lenders elected to exercise their conversion right in connection with the Merger, there is no premium or other contractual return in a prepayment. The aggregate amount required to be repaid in a prepayment to the FP Lenders would only be the outstanding principal amount of the FP Term Loan and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Our obligations under the FP Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our material subsidiaries, as determined in accordance with the FP Credit Agreement, and secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of the subsidiary guarantors.\nThe following table summarizes our ARR at each fiscal year end for the periods indicated.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we recognized within Other (expense) income, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, $5.0 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt, resulting from paying off the EIB Loan and the Eastward Loan Facilities.\nOn April 15, 2021, we entered into a credit agreement with FP Credit Partners, L.P., as agent for several lenders (the FP Lenders\u201d) (as amended on May 17, 2021, the FP Credit Agreement\u201d), for a $70.0 million term loan facility (the FP Term Loan\u201d). Upon funding in May 2021, the FP Term Loan was used (i) to pay off our existing credit facilities with Eastward Fund Management, LLC (the Eastward Loan Facility\u201d) and European Investment Bank (the EIB Loan Facility\u201d), and (ii) to fund working capital and for general corporate purposes. We incurred $12.3 million of debt issuance costs relating to the FP Term Loan.\nOur obligations under the finance contract were guaranteed by our material subsidiaries, as determined in accordance with the finance contract, and were secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of the borrower. The finance contract contained customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limited our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, dispose of assets, consummate mergers or acquisitions, make investments, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens or pay dividends or other distributions on our capital stock, subject in each case to customary exceptions and qualifications.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nInterest Expense. Interest Expense includes interest costs associated with our promissory and convertible notes, and amortization of deferred financing costs.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect income tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and\n\u2022the lack of marketability of our common stock as a private company;\n\u2022Change in fair value of warrant liabilities and contingent earnout liabilities. Spire excludes this as it does not reflect the underlying cash flows or operational results of the business.\nWe derive revenue from providing data, insights, and access to our cloud-based technology platform sold on a subscription basis. Some of our customer arrangements include the delivery of specific performance obligations and subsequent customer acceptance of project-based deliverables, which may impact the timing of revenue recognition. Subscription periods for our solutions generally range from one to two years and are typically non-cancelable, with customers having the right to terminate their agreements only if we materially breach our obligations under the agreement. Our subscription fees are typically billed either monthly or quarterly in advance.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAccounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted and Not Yet Adopted\nOverview\n\u2022Mergers and acquisition related expenses. Spire excludes these expenses as these are associated with transaction costs that are generally one time in nature and not reflective of the underlying operational results of its business.\n\nFor each data solution, we have the capability to offer customers a variety of features and additional value. The four forms of data we monetize are:\n\u2022Amortization of purchased intangibles. Spire incurs amortization expense for purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies. Amortization of intangible assets is a non-cash expense and is inconsistent in amount and frequency because it is significantly affected by the timing, size of acquisitions and the inherent subjective nature of purchase price allocations. Because these costs have already been incurred and cannot be recovered, and are non-cash expenses, Spire excludes these expenses for its internal management reporting processes. Spire's management also finds it useful to exclude these charges when assessing the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to Spire's revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to Spire's future period revenues as well.\nExpansion of and Further Penetration of Our Customer Base\n\u2022Solutions: Data-driven actionable recommendations to solve specific business problems, utilizing the full spectrum of our data analytics suite.\n\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to cash used for business acquisitions, the procurement, development, and deployment of capital assets, including satellites, ground stations, machinery and equipment, furniture, computer equipment and software, and leasehold improvements.\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities increased by $1.4 million, driven by the mark-to-market adjustment to reflect the fair market valuation of our public and private warrants. For additional information, see Notes 2, 10 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and development expenses increased $10.8 million, or 52%. $0.7 million of this growth was due to the addition of exactEarth operating costs, retention and stock acceleration expenses. Organic increases were primarily driven by an increase in personnel costs of $7.8 million, an increase in third-party services of $1.2 million, an increase in computing costs of $1.0 million and a $0.1 million increase in other operating expenses. The increase in personnel costs was driven by growth in headcount during the period. The increase in computing costs were driven by additional testing, modeling, and storage requirements used to develop new solutions. The increase in third-party services was driven by external technical resources required to support new development processes and capabilities.\nIn connection with the Reverse Recapitalization and pursuant to the Merger Agreement, eligible Spire equity holders are entitled to receive additional shares of our Common Stock upon the achievement of certain Earnout Triggering Events. In accordance with ASC 815-40, the earnout shares are not indexed to the Common Stock and therefore are accounted for as a liability and an offset to Additional paid-in capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the reverse recapitalization date and subsequently remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recorded as a component of Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDue to the nature of these events, we cannot predict the magnitude or frequency of future satellite deorbit and launch failure losses. While we sometimes purchase launch insurance when financially practical, the proceeds from these policies will typically only cover a portion of our loss in the event of an unplanned satellite deorbit or launch failure.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the loss on satellite deorbit and launch failure and does not reflect the cash capital expenditure requirements for the replacements of lost satellites. While these expenses could occur in a given year, the existence and magnitude of these costs could vary greatly and is unpredictable.\nThe following table summarizes our net cash used in operating activities, net cash used in investing activities, and net cash provided by financing activities for the periods indicated:\nFor the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the following items provides information that is helpful in understanding our results of operations, evaluating our future prospects, comparing our financial results across accounting periods, and comparing our financial results to our peers, many of which provide similar non-GAAP financial measures.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $28.0 million, or 223%. $2.2 million of this growth was due to the addition of exactEarth operating costs, retention and stock acceleration expenses. Organic increases were primarily driven by an increase in professional and consulting fees of $14.3 million, an increase in personnel costs of $7.1 million, an increase in business insurance of $2.7 million, an increase in facilities expenses of $0.8 million, an increase of $0.5 million in software expenses, and other miscellaneous operating expenses of $0.4 million. The increase in professional and consulting fees was primarily driven by accounting, legal and other consulting services associated with the Merger, company readiness for going public and the exactEarth acquisition. The increase in personnel costs was driven by stock-based compensation expense associated with a performance-based equity incentive program as well as overall headcount growth. The increase in business insurance was driven by incremental exposure associated with being a public company. The increase in facilities expenses was driven by an increase in office rent driven by expansion into new office space to accommodate our headcount growth. The increase in software expenses was driven by scaling to support overall company headcount growth.\nKey Business Metrics\nFor certain project-based performance obligations, we recognize a portion of our revenue over time using the output method, specifically contract milestones, which we have determined to be the most direct and reasonable measure of progress as they reflect the results achieved and value transferred to the customer.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following table summarizes the number of our ARR Customers and ARR Solution Customers at each fiscal year end for the periods indicated:\nInterest income was immaterial.\nOur business strategy may include, like our November 2021 acquisition of exactEarth, acquiring other complementary solutions, technologies, or businesses that we believe will allow us to reduce the time or costs required to develop new technologies, incorporate enhanced functionality into and complement our existing solution offerings, augment our engineering workforce, and enhance our technological capabilities.\nFor valuations performed prior to December 31, 2020, we used the option pricing method, ( OPM\u201d), back-solve method. In an OPM framework, the backsolve method for inferring the equity value implied by a recent financing transaction involves making assumptions for the expected time to liquidity, volatility and risk-free rate and then solving for the value of equity such that value for the most recent financing equals the amount paid. This method was selected due to our stage and uncertainty regarding the timing and probability of possible future exit scenarios.\nThe finance contract included customary events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of covenants or representations and warranties, cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events and a material adverse change event of default, subject to grace periods in certain instances. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, EIB had the right to declare all or a portion of the outstanding obligations to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the finance contract. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate would have applied on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the finance contract at a per annum rate equal to 2% above the otherwise applicable interest rate.\nOur contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple solutions and services to a customer. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer solutions or services that are capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the solution or service either on its own or with other available resources, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the solution or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Determining whether solutions and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as a single performance obligation involves significant judgement that requires us to assess the nature of the promise and value delivered to the customer. Certain of our contracts contain multiple project-based solutions and services promised to a customer over various phases (e.g., scoping, development, manufacturing, testing, launch, and/or satellite operations), which we assess at contract inception to determine which of the solutions and services promised in a contract are distinct in order to identify individual performance obligations.\nCOVID-19 Impact\nOther Income (Expense)\nOur largest source of operating cash inflows is cash collections from our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, expenses related to our technology infrastructure, expenses related to our computing infrastructure (including compute power, database storage and content delivery costs), building infrastructure costs (including leases for office space), fees for third-party services, and marketing program costs.\nIn August 2020, we entered into a finance contract with EIB and Spire Global Luxembourg S.a.r.l., as borrower. The finance contract provided for a term loan facility (the EIB Loan Facility\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of up to EUR 20.0 million, available in three tranches, of which we borrowed EUR 12.0 million. The proceeds of the term loans were required to be used for our innovation and expansion activities in Luxembourg and potentially other EU countries. In connection with funding the term loan under the FP Credit Agreement, we repaid the outstanding obligations under the EIB Loan Facility, including a prepayment premium of EUR 0.2 million.\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that we are (i) no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.\nCost of Revenue\n\n\u2022Other Acquisition Accounting Amortization. Spire incurs amortization expense for purchased data rights in connection with the acquisition of exactEarth and certain technologies. Amortization of this asset is a non-cash expense that can be significantly affected by the inherent subjective nature of the assigned value and useful life. Because this cost has already been incurred and cannot be recovered, and is a non-cash expense, Spire excludes this expense for its internal management reporting processes. Spire's management also finds it useful to exclude this charge when assessing the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted for loss on satellite deorbit and launch failure, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, change in value of contingent earnout liability, other (expense) income, net, stock-based compensation, other acquisition accounting amortization, mergers and acquisition related costs and expenses, and other unusual one-time costs. We believe Adjusted EBITDA can be useful in providing an understanding of the underlying operating results and trends and an enhanced overall understanding of our financial performance and prospects for the future. While Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measure under GAAP, management uses this financial measure to evaluate and forecast business performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements, such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments, and tax payments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our use of the term Adjusted EBITDA may vary from the use of similarly titled measures by others in our industry due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation.\nSales and Marketing\n\u2022ARR Net Retention Rate\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nWe have an equity incentive plan under which we grant stock-based awards to employees and non-employees. We account for stock-based awards in accordance with ASC 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense, based on estimated fair values, for all stock-based awards made to employees and non-employees for stock options.\n\nWarrant Liability\nChange in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities. Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities includes mark-to-market adjustments to reflect changes in fair value of warrant liabilities.\n\u2022Risk-Free Interest Rate-The interest rates used are based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.\nEIB Loan Facility\nSmaller Reporting Company Status\nThe Eastward Loan Facility included customary events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of covenants or representations and warranties, an investor abandonment default, cross- defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events and judgment defaults, subject to grace periods in certain instances. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, Eastward had the right to declare all or a portion of the outstanding obligations payable by us to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the loan agreement. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate would have applied on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the loan agreement at a per annum rate equal to 5% above the otherwise applicable interest rate.\nConvertible Notes\nOur platform applies our value-add insights and predictive analytics to this proprietary data to create commercially valuable datasets. We offer three data solutions to our customers, which vary in complexity and price and can be delivered in near real-time via our API that can be easily integrated into our customers' business operations:\nCost of Revenue\nNumber of ARR Customers and ARR Solution Customers\n\nARR increased by $34.6 million, or 96%, of which $18.5 million was attributable to our acquisition of exactEarth. Our organic ARR growth was 44%.\nEastward Loan Facility\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020\nOperating expenses consist of our research and development, our sales and marketing, and our general and administrative expenses. As we continue to invest in our growth, including through hiring additional personnel, we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars as revenue grows; however, we expect our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to decrease over time.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related expenses for personnel in our executive, finance and accounting, facilities, legal, human resources, global supply chain, and management information systems functions, as well as other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees related to third-party legal counsel, fees related to accounting, tax and audit costs, office facilities costs, software subscription costs, and other corporate costs.\nOver time, we expect the mix of our total revenues in the Americas and APAC to continue to increase with additional sales and marketing focus in those regions.\nThese value-add data features allow customers to solve various use cases and provide a path to expand throughout the customer's relationship.\nFor more details on the Merger, including all equity conversions, please see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022the prices at which we sold shares of our convertible preferred stock to outside investors in arms-length transactions;\nAs part of our acquisition of exactEarth in November 2021, we assumed a loan agreement with the Strategic Innovation Fund (\"SIF\") which was recorded at fair value of the debt. As of December 31, 2021, $4.5 million was included in Long-term debt, non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under this agreement and subsequent amendment, we are eligible to receive funding for certain expenditures incurred from February 13, 2018 to May 12, 2023, up to a maximum of $5.7 million. The loan is repayable in 15 annual payments beginning February 28, 2026 and has a stated interest rate of zero.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\u2022risks and opportunities relevant to our business;\nNet cash used in operating activities in fiscal year 2020 was $14.8 million. This reflected our net loss of $32.5 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $13.7 million, and a net decrease in our operating assets and liabilities of $4.0 million. Non-cash items primarily included $5.0 million of non-cash interest and financing related costs, $5.5 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $2.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, $0.7 million for loss on satellite deorbit and launch failure and $0.3 million of other miscellaneous items. The net decrease in operating assets and liabilities primarily included an increase of $1.1 million in contract assets and deferred contract costs, a decrease of $0.5 million in other long-term liabilities, and an increase of $0.4 million in accounts receivable. This was offset by an increase of $3.2 million in contract liabilities and an increase of $2.6 million in accounts payable and other accrued expenses.\nThe following table summarizes our ARR Net Retention Rate at each fiscal year end for the periods indicated (excludes exactEarth):\nInterest expense increased $4.6 million, or 69%, primarily as a result of incurring higher interest charges associated with our EIB, Eastward and FP loan facilities as discussed below.\nThe Eastward Loan Facility bore interest at a rate of 11.75% per annum, payable monthly in arrears. We were also required to pay a commitment fee equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of each term loan borrowing. Following an interest only period of 24 months, the principal amount of each term loan was repayable in 24 equal monthly installments based on an amortization period of 36 months. The outstanding principal amount of each term loan, plus a repayment fee equal to 2.00% of the original $15.0 million principal amount of such term loan, was due and payable 48 months after such borrowing.\n\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those set forth in the sections titled Risk Factors\u201d and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Our fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are referred to herein as fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020, respectively. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d and similar terms refer to Spire and its subsidiaries.\nWe provide our solutions to global customers through a subscription model or project-based solutions. We currently sell directly to end customers and utilize reseller partners when beneficial.\nAcquisition of exactEarth\nheld by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.\n\n\u2022Other (expense) income, net. We exclude other (expense) income, net because it includes one-time and other items that do not reflect the underlying operational results of our business.\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the valuation of intangible assets. Examples of critical estimates and assumptions in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future revenue growth, margins, customer retention rates, technology life, royalty rates, expected use of acquired assets, and discount rates. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets. These estimates are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recorded.\nFor valuations performed from January 1, 2021 to the Merger, we used a hybrid method of the OPM and the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method ( PWERM\u201d). PWERM considers various potential liquidity outcomes. Our approach included the use of an initial public offering scenario, a strategic merger or sale scenario, and a scenario assuming continued operation as a private entity. Under the hybrid OPM and PWERM method, the per share value calculated under the OPM and PWERM are weighted based on expected exit outcomes specific to each allocation methodology to arrive at a final estimated fair value per share of the common stock before a discount for lack of marketability is applied.\nWhile we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to grow in absolute dollars in the future, primarily due to increased employee-related expenses as we grow our headcount, to support our sales and marketing efforts and our continued expansion of our sales capacity across our solutions, we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue to decrease in future periods as our revenue growth exceeds our growth in sales and marketing spend.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nThe contingent earnout liability is categorized as a Level 3 fair value measurement using the Monte Carlo model because the Company estimates projections during the Earnout Period utilizing unobservable inputs. Contingent earnout payments involve certain assumptions requiring significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. The assumptions utilized in the calculation are based on the achievement of certain stock price milestones, including the current price of our common stock, expected volatility, risk-free rate, expected term and dividend rate.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022trends and developments in our industry, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022our results of operations and financial position, including the present value of expected future cash flows and the value of tangible and intangible assets;\nWe believe that our current and future performance are dependent on many factors, including, but not limited to, those described below. While these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to achieve successful results. For additional information about these risks, see the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d If we are unable to address these risks, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThere are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures because non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures provided by other companies.\nGovernment Loan\nof the prior June 30, or (ii) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock\n\u2022Smart data: Clean data fused with third-party datasets and proprietary analysis to enhance value and provide insights;\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and the world and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. While we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic or any resurgences of the pandemic locally or globally, our compliance with these measures has impacted our day-to-day operations and could continue to disrupt our business and operations, as well as that of certain of our customers whose industries are more severely impacted by these measures, for an indefinite period of time. Through fiscal year 2021, we have experienced adverse changes in customer buying behavior that began in March 2020 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including decreased customer engagement, delayed sales cycles, and deterioration in near-term demand. In 2021, the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19 became the dominant strains in numerous countries around the world, including the United States, and are believed to be more contagious than other previously identified COVID-19 strains. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced delays and re-work due to third party satellite launch providers schedule shifts, delays and increased expenses in our hiring process, some attrition from adjusting company policies due to the COVID-19 pandemic and additional time and expenses supporting customer contracts. Despite these headwinds, we experienced an increase in revenue for fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020.\nImpact of Foreign Exchange Rates\n\n\nCost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs, depreciation, hosted infrastructure and high-power computing costs, third-party operating and royalty costs associated with delivering our data and services to our customers, and amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the exactEarth acquisition. Personnel costs are primarily related to the cost of our employees supporting and managing our constellation operations including satellite operations, ground station control and launch management. Costs associated with the manufacture and launch of our satellites, including personnel costs, are capitalized and depreciated upon placement in service, typically over a three year expected useful life. As satellites reach their expected end of useful life, they are generally replaced with replenishment satellites to maintain our constellation at optimal performance. Costs associated with the acquisition and development of new ground stations, including the bill of materials and labor to install the ground station, are capitalized and depreciated upon placement in service typically over a four-year expected useful life. We anticipate ongoing capital spending to repair and replenish ground stations as they reach their end of useful life to keep our ground station network at optimal performance. Our proprietary ground station network is primarily located in third-party locations where we incur lease and other operational charges. Cost of revenue also includes royalties associated with third-party data sets that we integrate into our data solutions.\nCustomer contracts for data trials and one-time transactions are excluded from the calculation of ARR.\nLimitations on the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\u2022The presentation of non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors should read this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto also included within.\n\u2022Expected Term-We use the weighted average period that the stock options are expected to remain outstanding based on historical experience.\nThe following table outlines the reconciliation from net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we issued additional convertible notes with a cumulative principal amount of $20.0 million, with maturities of January and February 2025, respectively, which converted into our Class A common stock at the Closing. In April 2021, we entered into the FP Credit Agreement (as defined and further described below), utilizing a portion of those funds to pay-off our existing credit arrangements with EIB and Eastward. In November 2021, we closed our acquisition of exactEarth for the purchase price of $129.0 million, consisting of $109.6 million in cash and $22.3 million of common stock, net of $3.0 million post-combination expense.\nLoss on Satellite Deorbit and Launch Failure\nOther (Expense) Income, Net. Other (Expense) Income, Net consists primarily of tax credits, grant income, the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses, benefit from loan forgiveness, loss on debt extinguishment, and sales and local taxes. We use the local currency as our functional currency for Luxembourg, United Kingdom, Singapore and Canada.\n\u2022the rights, preferences, and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock;\nThe FP Lenders were also entitled to a commitment fee of $1.75 million that was fully earned and paid upon signing the FP Credit Agreement. The FP Term Loan bears interest at a rate of 9.00% per annum. Prior to the Merger, the FP Term Loan bore interest at a rate of 8.50% per annum. Since the FP Lenders elected to exercise their conversion right in connection with the Merger, and we chose not to prepay the remaining, non-converted outstanding principal amount of the FP Term Loan at the closing of such transaction, our interest rate under the FP Term Loan increased to 9.0% per annum.\nOur ARR Net Retention Rate can be impacted from period to period by large increases or decreases in customer contract value and large decreases in contract value from customers that have chosen not to renew their contracts with us. An ARR Net Retention Rate greater than 100% is an indication that we are growing the value of the solutions our customers are purchasing from us from a fiscal period end versus the prior fiscal period end. An ARR Net Retention Rate less than 100% is an indication that we are reducing the value of the solutions our customers are purchasing from us from a fiscal period end versus the prior fiscal period end. For fiscal year 2021, our ARR Net Retention Rate decreased 29% from fiscal year 2020. This decrease was driven by the growth in our ARR renewable base, a higher concentration of new customer ARR versus upsell, and delays in certain Space Services contracts that caused the contract value to spread over a longer period.\nThe following tables set forth selected Consolidated Statements of Operations data and such data as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods indicated:\nOperating Expenses\n\u2022the status of platform development activities;\nOur obligations under the Eastward Loan Facility were guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries, as determined in accordance with the loan agreement, and were secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of the co-borrowers. The loan agreement contained customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limited our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, dispose of assets, consummate mergers or acquisitions, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, pay dividends or other distributions on our capital stock, make investments and enter into transactions with affiliates, subject in each case to customary exceptions and qualifications.\n\nAs our fourth solution, we are also pioneering an innovative business model through our Space Services solution. We leverage our fully deployed infrastructure and large-scale operations to enable our customers to obtain customized data through our API. Our customers can begin receiving data in less than a year after engaging with us and receive data by entering into a subscription agreement. Our Space Services offering provides our customers with fast, scalable and reliable access to space.\nIn November 2021, we closed our acquisition of exactEarth for the purchase price of $129.0 million, consisting of $109.6 million in cash and $22.3 million of common stock, net of $3.0 million post-combination expense. The acquisition of exactEarth accelerates growth of our existing maritime business with additional data solutions, cross-selling opportunities, and expansion of our geographic footprint. exactEarth is now a fully-owned subsidiary of Spire Global, Inc. and will continue to conduct operations from Cambridge, Ontario, Canada.\nTotal revenue increased $14.9 million, or 52%, driven primarily by the growth in the number of ARR Customers combined with our ARR Net Retention Rate greater than 100%. The exactEarth acquisition added $1.5 million of revenue in fiscal year 2021. Our organic ARR Customers increased 61%, from 144 as of fiscal year 2020 to 232 as of fiscal year 2021, which contributed to an increase in revenue from new customers. Our organic ARR Net Retention Rate was 110% during fiscal year 2021, which contributed to an increase in revenue from our existing customer base.\nFor fiscal year 2021, we derived 48% of our revenue from Europe, Middle East, Africa ( EMEA\u201d), 36% of our revenue from the Americas and 16% of our revenue from Asia Pacific ( APAC\u201d). For fiscal year 2020, we derived 50% of our revenue from EMEA, 38% of our revenue from the Americas, and 12% of our revenue from APAC. For fiscal year 2021, we derived 47% of our revenue from subscription arrangements, compared to 27% for fiscal year 2020. This percentage mix can fluctuate significantly from period to period driven primarily by the timing of the non-subscription revenue recognition in our contracts.\n\u2022Maritime: Precise space-based data used for highly accurate ship monitoring, ship safety and route optimization.\nWe define an ARR Customer as an entity that has a contract with us or through our reseller partners contracts, that is either a binding and renewable agreement for our subscription solutions, or a binding multi-year contract as of the measurement date independent of the number of solutions the entity has under contract. A single organization with separate subsidiaries, segments, or divisions may represent multiple customers, as we treat each entity that is invoiced separately as an individual customer. In cases where customers subscribe to our platform through our reseller partners, each end customer that meets the above definition is counted separately as an ARR Customer. All entities that have contracts for data trials and one-time transactions are excluded from the calculation of ARR Customers.\n\u2022Clean data: Clean and structured data directly from our proprietary nanosatellites;\n\u2022Expected Dividend Yield-The dividend rate used is zero as we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.\nIn response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we initially implemented plans to manage our costs. In fiscal year 2020, for part of the year, we temporarily limited the addition of new employees and third-party contracted services, curtailed most travel expenses except where critical to the business, and acted to limit discretionary spending. As we obtained further visibility on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we lifted some of these limitations to support our growth. Although we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance become available, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and/or the precautionary measures that we, our customers and governmental authorities have adopted have resulted in, and could continue to result in, customers not purchasing or renewing our solutions or services, delays or lengthening of our sales cycles, and reductions in average transaction sizes, and could negatively affect our customer success and sales and marketing efforts, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business and operating results. Because our solutions have future obligations and a portion of that revenue is recognized over time, the effect of the pandemic may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. Our competitors could experience similar or different impacts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could result in changes to our competitive landscape. While we have developed and continue to develop plans to help mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on our business, these efforts may not be effective, and any protracted economic downturn could significantly affect our business and operating results. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our business. For additional information regarding the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d\nWhile we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to grow in absolute dollars in future periods as our employee-related expenses increase to support our revenue growth and we have increased expenses from being a public company, we expect our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to decrease as revenue growth exceeds our growth in general and administrative spend.\n\u2022Stock-based compensation. We exclude stock-based compensation expenses primarily because they are non-cash expenses that we exclude from our internal management reporting processes. We also find it useful to exclude these expenses when we assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FASB ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation ( ASC 718\u201d), we believe excluding stock-based compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business results of operations and those of other companies.\n\u2022We had 255 organic ARR Solution Customers under contract and added 343 from exactEarth, ending the fourth quarter with 598 ARR Solution Customers, a 288% increase year-over-year. For the definition of ARR Solution Customers, see the section titled -Key Business Metrics.\u201d\nComponents of Results of Operations\nIncome tax increased $0.1 million, or 24%, primarily driven by higher income tax in our United Kingdom subsidiary.\nOn August 16, 2021, we announced that we had closed our Merger with NavSight. As a result, we became a wholly owned subsidiary of NavSight, and NavSight changed its name to Spire Global, Inc.\u201d\nSales and marketing expenses increased $10.1 million, or 98%. $1.2 million of this growth was due to the addition of exactEarth operating costs, retention and stock acceleration expenses. Organic increases were primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $7.0 million, an increase in marketing and professional services costs of $1.4 million, an increase of $0.3 million in travel expenses and $0.2 million increase in other operating expenses. The increase in personnel costs was driven by growth in our headcount involved in selling activities. The increase in marketing and professional services costs was driven by growth in our expenditures for demand generation, brand awareness and public relations. The increase in travel expense was due to improved travel conditions following the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe cash flows from financing activities relate primarily to the Merger, debt, warrants and convertible note financings.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, sales commissions, marketing and advertising costs, costs incurred in the development of customer relationships, brand development costs, travel-related expenses and amortization of purchased intangible backlog associated with the exactEarth acquisition. Commission costs on new customer contract bookings are considered costs of obtaining customer contracts. Commission costs for multi-year deals are considered contract acquisition costs and are deferred and then amortized over the period of the contract excluding the last 12 months, which are expensed at the beginning of that final period. Commission costs on contracts completed with a term of twelve months or less are expensed in the period incurred.\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\n\u2022our business conditions and projections;\nWe define ARR as our expected annualized revenue from customers that are under contract with us at the end of the reporting period with a binding and renewable agreement for our subscription solutions, or a customer that has a binding multi-year contract that can range from components of our Space Services solution to a project-based customer solution. Project-based contracts or customers are considered recurring when they have signed a multi-year binding agreement that has a renewable component in the contract or a customer that has multiple contracts that we continue to have under contract over multiple years.\nProvision for income taxes consists of federal and certain state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions. We do not provide for income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since we intend to invest these earnings outside of the United States permanently. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.\nOther Income (Expense)\nIn connection with the Merger, we raised $264.8 million of proceeds including the contribution of $230.0 million of cash held in NavSight's trust account from its initial public offering, net of redemptions of NavSight public stockholders of $210.2 million, and $245.0 million of cash in connection with the PIPE Investment. We incurred $38.7 million of merger and acquisitions costs, consisting of banking, legal, and other professional fees, of which $32.1 million was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital, and the remaining $6.6 million was expensed to general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nWe generally classify warrants for the purchase of shares of our common stock as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets unless the warrants meet certain specific criteria that require the warrants to be classified within stockholders' deficit. Those warrants accounted for as liabilities are freestanding financial instruments that may require us to transfer assets upon exercise. The warrant liability is initially recorded at fair value upon the date of issuance of each warrant and is subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. The fair value of the Public Warrants is based on quoted market prices and is classified as a Level 1 financial instrument. The fair value of the Private Warrants is estimated using the Black-Scholes model with inputs that include the Company's stock price in an actively traded market, making this fair value classified as a Level 2 financial instrument. The other significant assumptions used in the model are the exercise price, expected term, volatility, interest rate, and dividend yield.\nIn December 2020, we entered into a line of credit agreement with Eastward and certain of our subsidiaries as co-borrowers (the Eastward Loan Facility\u201d). The agreement provided for a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25.0 million, of which we borrowed $15.0 million. We used the proceeds to prepay existing indebtedness and the remaining proceeds were available to be used for general corporate purposes. In connection with funding the term loan under the FP Credit Agreement, we repaid the outstanding obligations under the Eastward Loan Facility, including a prepayment premium and fees of $0.8 million.\nAs our solutions have grown, we continue to focus on further penetration of our initial industries including maritime, aviation, logistics and government (civil and defense/intelligence) among others. We believe our technology and solutions give us the ability to also expand into additional industries, including energy, financial services, agriculture, transportation, and insurance, and geographies, including Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. Our revenue growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand into new industries and geographies. The costs associated with these expansions may adversely affect our results of operations.\nFollowing the Closing, we have used the market closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the NYSE.\nWe expect that our principal sources of liquidity will be the proceeds received from the Merger, the additional convertible notes issued and the FP Term Loan (as defined below). We believe this will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support solution development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the ongoing investments in technology infrastructure, the introduction of new and enhanced solutions, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures, strategic initiatives or investments and our ongoing operations. In the event that we decide, or are required, to seek additional financing from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, third-party consulting fees, and computing costs. Our research and development efforts are focused on improving our satellite technology, developing new data sets, developing new algorithms and enhancing our smart and predictive analytics, and enhancing the ease of use and utility of our space-based data solutions.\nIn fiscal year 2021, we incurred no expense in this category compared to fiscal year 2020, where we experienced the loss of two satellites due to a third-party deployment issue associated with a single launch.\nAcquisitions\nFor additional detail regarding the terms associated with the exactEarth acquisition, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur ARR Customer and ARR Solution Customer growth in the periods presented have been driven by landing new ARR Customers across our four solutions (Maritime, Aviation, Weather and Space Services) and expanding our geographical footprint, along with having a low number of customers who have chosen not to renew their contracts with us. We believe that our ability to expand our customer base is a key indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business, and our future potential business opportunities.\nWe employ a land and expand\u201d business model that focuses on efficiently acquiring new customers ( land\u201d) and then growing our relationships with these customers over time ( expand\u201d). We have the capability to offer customers additional data sets and a variety of enhanced features that potentially grow the value of the services our customers contract with us. Our future revenue growth and our path to profitability are dependent upon our ability to continue to land new customers and then expand adoption of our solutions within their organizations.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2021 was $120.8 million. This was driven by net $103.9 million of cash used in the exactEarth acquisition, $10.7 million of investment in our technology infrastructure and $4.7 million of investment in leasehold improvements, furniture, computer equipment, and machinery equipment.\nIncome Taxes\n\n\u2022the hiring of key personnel and the experience of management; and\nWe continue investing in growing our business and capitalizing on our market opportunity while balancing the uncertainties from the COVID-19 pandemic. We intend to continue to add headcount to our global sales and marketing teams to acquire new customers and to increase sales to existing customers and we intend to continue to add headcount to our research and development teams and otherwise invest to improve and innovate our nanosatellite, ground station and data analytics technologies. For fiscal year 2021, our spending on research and development increased by $10.9 million, or 52%, from fiscal year 2020, which included $0.3 million from the exactEarth acquisition. For fiscal year 2021, our sales and marketing expenses increased by $10.1 million, or 98%, from fiscal year 2020, which included $0.6 million from the exactEarth acquisition. Our total headcount across all functions has increased from 251 employees as of December 31, 2020, to 370 employees as of December 31, 2021, which increase includes 33 exactEarth employees. We believe that these investments will contribute to our long-term growth. The costs of these investments may adversely affect our operating results.\nIncome Tax Provision\n\u2022EBITDA. We define EBITDA as net income (loss), plus depreciation and amortization expense, plus interest expense, and plus the provision for (or minus benefit from) income taxes.\nPrivately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, and our board of directors' assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant, and factors that may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. These factors include, but are not limited to:\nWe calculate our ARR Net Retention Rate for a particular fiscal period end by dividing (i) our ARR from those ARR Customers that were also customers as of the last day of the prior fiscal period end by (ii) the ARR from all customers as of the last day of the prior fiscal period. This calculation measures the overall impact from increases in customer contract value (upsells), the decreases in customer contract value (downsells), and the decreases in customer value resulting from customers that have chosen not to renew their contracts with us.\nground stations or fulfill its intended technical mission for a duration greater than one month. The loss amount is presented net of any insurance claims received. We did not incur any of these expenses in fiscal year 2021. We incurred $0.7 million in expenses in fiscal year 2020.\nGross margin for fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020 was 57% and 64%, respectively. The decrease in fiscal year 2021 gross margin compared to fiscal year 2020 was driven primarily by higher depreciation, computing expenses, royalties, and strategic customer expenses as described above. This metric can fluctuate significantly from period to period driven primarily by the timing of the revenue as well as the timing of our technology investments to support future revenue. The exactEarth acquisition negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 2%. Of this reduction, approximately half was driven by purchase accounting adjustments including reduction to exactEarth deferred revenue and amortization of purchased intangibles.\nWe report in U.S. dollars, and the functional currency of our foreign operating subsidiaries is the local currency, including the Euro, the British Pound, the Singapore Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. Many of these currencies have strengthened significantly against the U.S. dollar since fiscal year 2020. In fiscal year 2021, approximately 48% of our revenues were generated in non-U.S. dollar-denominated currencies respectively. This compares to fiscal year 2020 where approximately 50% of our revenues were generated in non-U.S. dollar-denominated currencies respectively. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the period for revenues and expenses. To the extent we experience significant currency fluctuations, our results of operations may be impacted.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nResults of Operations\nWe are a global provider of space-based data, analytics and space services, offering unique datasets and powerful insights about Earth from the ultimate vantage point-space-so that organizations can make decisions with confidence, accuracy and speed. We own and operate one of the world's largest multi-purpose satellite constellations in low earth orbit. Our fully deployed constellation consists of over 100 satellites and we believe it is also one of the world's largest listening\u201d constellations, observing the earth utilizing radio frequency sensors. We enrich this hard-to-acquire, valuable data with analytics and predictive solutions, providing data as a subscription to organizations around the world so that they can improve business operations, decrease their environmental footprint, deploy resources for growth and competitive advantage and mitigate risk.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which items are adjusted to calculate our non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our public disclosures. Some of these limitations are:\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n\u2022Expected Volatility-As our stock was not publicly traded prior to the Closing, the volatility is based on a benchmark analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nNavSight Merger\nWe track our progress landing new customers by measuring the number of ARR Solution Customers we have from one fiscal year to the next. For instance, we have increased our number of ARR Solution Customers from 154 for fiscal year 2020 to 598 for fiscal year 2021. We track our progress in expanding our customer relationships by measuring our ARR Net Retention Rate. For the definition of ARR Net Retention Rate, see the section titled -Key Business Metrics.\u201d Our organic ARR Net Retention Rate was 110% for fiscal year 2021 and 154% for fiscal year 2020.\n\u2022Common Stock Valuation-Prior to our Closing Date of the Merger, determining the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying our stock-based awards, which were not publicly traded, involved significant judgment and had historically been determined with the help of an independent third-party valuation firm. For awards granted subsequent to the Closing Date, the fair value of our common stock is based on the closing price of our common stock, as reported on the NYSE, on the date of grant.\nCommon Stock Valuation\nOther (expense) income, net increased $5.8 million, or 709%, primarily driven by $5.0 million in debt extinguishment expenses resulting from paying off the EIB Loan and the Eastward Loan Facilities, and an increase in realized and unrealized foreign exchange expense of $1.9 million, and $0.3 million of miscellaneous other expenses, offset by an increase of $1.7 million in grant income driven by the extinguishment of debt resulting from the U.S. government's forgiveness of our loan under the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES\u201d) Act.\nFP Credit Agreement\nThe FP Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of covenants or representations and warranties, cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events and judgment defaults, subject to grace periods in certain instances. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the FP Lenders may declare all or a portion of the outstanding obligations payable by us to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the FP Credit Agreement. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate will apply on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the FP Credit Agreement at a per annum rate equal to 2% above the otherwise applicable interest rate.\nLoss on Satellite Deorbit and Launch Failure. Loss on Satellite Deorbit and Launch Failure consists of the write-off of the remaining capitalized costs associated with the manufacture and launch of our satellites prior to the end of the satellite's useful life. We contract with third-party companies to launch, carry, and deploy our LEMUR satellites into space. A loss could result from a third-party launch or deployer failure, a technical failure of the satellite, or the deorbit of a satellite before the end of the satellite's useful life. A technical failure could include a satellite that is not able to communicate with our network of\nIn connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. For additional information, see the sections titled Risk Factors\u201d and Controls and Procedures.\u201d\n\u2022Full year 2021 revenue was $43.4 million, an increase of 52% from fiscal year 2020. Excluding the $1.5 million of revenue recognized from exactEarth during the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, full year 2021 revenue was $41.9 million, an increase of 47% from fiscal year 2020.\n\u2022Aviation: Precise space-based data used for highly accurate aircraft monitoring, aircraft safety and route optimization.\n\u2022ARR Customers\n\u2022Other unusual one-time costs. We exclude these as they are unusual items that do not reflect the ongoing operational\nFrom July 2019 through October 2020, we issued and sold subordinated convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $42.9 million (the 2019 Spire Notes\u201d). In May 2021, we agreed with the holders of the 2019 Spire Notes to extend the maturity date of all convertible promissory notes outstanding at December 31, 2020 from January 29, 2022 to July 31, 2022. From January 2021 through February 2021, we issued and sold subordinated convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $20.0 million, which mature four years from the date of issuance (the 2021 Spire Notes\u201d). The 2019 Spire Notes and the 2021 Spire Notes accrued interest at a rate of 8.0% per annum and converted into shares of our common stock in connection with the Closing, so they are no longer outstanding.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nInterest Income. Interest Income includes interest earned on our cash balances.\n\u2022Weather: Precise space-based data used for highly accurate weather forecasting.\nResearch and Development\nNet cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2020 was $16.6 million. This was primarily driven by $30.1 million of new loan proceeds net of issuance costs and $0.6 million of proceeds from convertible notes, offset by $14.1 million of re-payment on our existing loan facility.\nHighlights from Fiscal Year 2021\nUnder the terms of the EIB finance contract, on August 20, 2020, we issued to EIB a warrant exercisable for 454,899 shares (Tranche A) of Old Spire Common Stock at a price of $0.0001 per share. Upon completion of the Merger, the exercisable share count converted to 775,966. On October 29, 2020, we issued to EIB an additional warrant exercisable for 454,899 shares (Tranche B) of Old Spire Common Stock at a price of $0.0001 per share. Upon completion of the Merger, the exercisable share count converted to 775,966. Each such warrant included a put option, whereby EIB had the right to have us repurchase the warrants by paying EIB an amount equal to the then-current fair market value of the shares of Old Spire Common Stock for which the warrants were exercisable. The amount that we were required to pay upon the exercise of the put option was subject to a purchase price cap of EUR 10.0 million for each warrant. In September 2021, EIB submitted a notice of cancellation for the 775,966 EIB warrants (Tranche A). In October 2021, EIB submitted a notice of cancellation for the remaining 775,966 EIB warrants (Tranche B). The total settlement value associated with the EIB warrants was $19.9 million and was paid in November 2021. Upon settlement, $12.8 million was released from restricted cash which had been held in guarantee for EIB warrant redemption.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for our securityholders, such as an initial public offering or a sale of the company, given prevailing market conditions;\n\nWe review the following key business metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions:\nExpansion into New Industries and Geographies\nInvestment in Growth\nRevenue\nARR Customers grew by 431, or 299%. The addition of exactEarth added 343 ARR Customers. Our organic ARR Customer growth was 61%. ARR Solution Customers grew by 444. The addition of exactEarth added 343 ARR Solution Customers. Our organic ARR Solution Customer growth was 66%.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\n(1)Includes stock-based compensation as follows:\nContingent Earnout Liability\nWe believe that in addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our business, results of operations and financial condition. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and facilitates period to period comparisons of operations, as this eliminates the effects of certain variables from period to period for reasons that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance. In addition to our GAAP measures, we use this non-GAAP financial measure internally for budgeting and resource allocation purposes and in analyzing our financial results.\nARR Net Retention Rate\n\u2022On August 16, 2021, we completed the Merger with NavSight and received cash proceeds of $236.6 million and were listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol SPIR.\u201d\nRevenue\nOur solutions are offered to customers across numerous industries and we not only have the opportunity to upsell within each one, but we also have the opportunity to cross-sell among all our solutions.\nTo support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities, we have allowed many of our employees to work remotely. As of December 31, 2021, our employees are permitted to come into the office in accordance with all applicable local, State and Federal guidelines and regulations. Our offices will only remain open to the extent local, state and federal authorities permit us to do so and our own criteria and conditions to ensure employee\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2020 was $10.4 million. This was primarily driven by $9.6 million of investment in our technology infrastructure and $0.7 million of investment in leasehold improvements, furniture, computer equipment, and machinery equipment.\nFor contracts with more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations using the relative standalone selling price ( SSP\u201d) of each obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. SSP is generally estimated using cost plus a reasonable margin based on value added to the customer.\n$8.5 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $6.0 million of non-cash interest and debt issuance amortization expense, $2.3 million on debt extinguishment expense, $1.6 million on warrant liability revaluation, and $0.5 million of other non-cash expenses offset by $67.0 million non-cash gain on the contingent earnout liability revaluation. The net decrease in operating assets and liabilities primarily included an increase of $6.7 million in other current assets combined with a $5.0 million increase in accounts receivable. This was offset by an increase of $4.7 million in accrued wages and other expenses, a $2.3 million increase in accounts payable, a $2.2 million increase in other long term liabilities, and a $0.3 million increase in other non-cash assets and liabilities.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt;\nOur ARR growth in the periods presented has been driven by both landing new ARR Customers along with increasing the amount of business with our existing customers. This is reflected in the increase in the total number of ARR Customers as well as ARR Net Retention Rates that have been over 100% for the periods presented. Due in part to the timing of some of our project-based contracts, including when engagements start and stop, our ARR has fluctuated from period to period in the past, and we expect our ARR to fluctuate from period to period in the future. ARR is a leading indicator and accordingly will tend to outpace the revenue impact as we recognize the contract value over time.\nWe expect cost of revenue, including depreciation and amortization expenses, third-party operating costs and royalties, and high-powered computing costs, to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. Additionally, we expect the purchase accounting adjustments associated with the exactEarth acquisition, namely higher amortization expenses and lower deferred revenue, to grow in relative terms as we absorb the impact on a full year basis. These items will likely have a negative impact on gross margin for at least the near term.\n\u2022On November 30, 2021, we completed the acquisition of exactEarth for the purchase price of $129.0 million, consisting of $109.6 million in cash and $22.3 million of shares of our Class A common stock, net of $3.0 million post-combination expense.\nhealth and safety are satisfied, including social distancing and enhanced cleaning protocols. While we have developed plans for our employees to begin safely returning to their respective offices, we cannot predict when or how we will be able to completely lift the work from home requirements or other COVID-19 related restrictions for geographic areas that continue to be significantly impacted by the pandemic or certain other actions taken as part of our business continuity plans, including travel restrictions. We may also have to reinstate work from home requirements in response to further changes in local regulations in connection with developments in the COVID-19 pandemic. While the adjustments to our operations may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our solution development, sales, marketing, and customer support efforts, as of the date of this filing, we do not believe our work from home protocol has materially adversely impacted our internal controls, financial reporting systems or our operations.\nWe recognize the cost of stock-based awards granted to our employees and non-employees based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. For Restricted Stock Units (\"RSU\") with service-based vesting conditions, the fair value is calculated based upon the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant using the intrinsic value method. We determine the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is impacted by the following assumptions:\nFor additional detail regarding the terms associated with our financing arrangements, see Notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nresults of our business.\nOperating Expenses\nFor additional information regarding the terms of our credit facilities and notes, see Notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHistorically, for all periods prior to the Merger, since there has been no public market of our common stock, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying our share-based awards was estimated on each grant date by our board of directors. To determine the fair value of our common stock underlying option grants, our board of directors considered, among other things, input from management, valuations of our common stock prepared by unrelated third-party valuation firms in accordance with the guidance provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 2013 Practice Aid, Valuation of\nThe FP Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, pay dividends or other distributions on our capital stock, dispose of assets, consummate mergers or acquisitions and enter into transactions with affiliates, subject in each case to customary exceptions and qualifications. Prior to the consummation of a Qualifying IPO (as defined in the FP Credit Agreement), which includes the Merger, we were required to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, minimum unrestricted cash of at least $15.0 million, as determined in accordance with the FP Credit Agreement, provided that this covenant did not apply following any fiscal quarter in which we achieved positive EBITDA so long as we continued to maintain positive EBITDA in subsequent fiscal quarters. Since the Merger occurred, we are no longer required to maintain this financial covenant per the terms of the FP Credit Agreement.\n\u2022As of December 31, 2021, annual recurring revenue ( ARR\u201d) was $70.8 million, an increase of approximately 96% from December 31, 2020. Excluding the $18.5 million of ARR contributed by the acquisition of exactEarth, Spire's December 31, 2021 ARR was $52.3 million, an increase of 44% from December 31, 2020. For the definition of ARR, see the section titled -Key Business Metrics.\u201d\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nWe define an ARR Solution Customer similarly to an ARR Customer, but we count every solution the customer has with us separately. As a result, the count of ARR Solution Customers exceeds the count of ARR Customers in each year as some customers contract with us for multiple solutions. Our multiple solutions customers are those customers that are under contract for at least two of our solutions: Maritime, Aviation, Weather, and Space Services. All entities that have contracts for data trials and one-time transactions are excluded from the calculation of ARR Solution Customers.\nCost of revenue increased $8.4 million, or 82%, $1.7 million of this growth was due to the addition of exactEarth operating costs, retention and stock acceleration expenses. Organic increases were primarily driven by an increase in depreciation expense of $2.2 million, an increase in computing costs of $2.2 million, third party royalty costs increases of $1.0 million, $0.7 million of space services hardware expenses and $0.2 million higher personnel expenses, with the remainder in higher miscellaneous operating expenses. Depreciation expense increased from the prior period driven by continued additions to our constellation. The increase in computing costs were driven by higher expenses to support customer growth and some of our weather solutions transitioning from research and development to production. The increase in third party royalty costs was driven by an increase in sales activity, resulting in higher payments to third-party data set providers as they augment our data solutions. The increase in space services third-party hardware expenses was in support of a strategic customer commitment. The increase in personnel expenses was driven by headcount growth.\n\u2022Loss on satellite deorbit and launch failure. We exclude loss on satellite deorbit and launch failure because if there was no loss, the expense would be accounted for as depreciation and would also be excluded as part of our EBITDA calculation.\nChange in fair value of contingent earnout liability was $67.0 million, driven by the mark-to-market adjustment to reflect the fair market valuation of the underlying stock price. In connection with the Merger, eligible Spire equity holders are entitled to receive additional shares of our common stock upon our achievement of certain Earnout Triggering Events which are treated as liabilities and required to be marked to market each reporting period. Changes in valuation are recorded against the Contingent earnout liability account with the offsetting gain or loss recorded in Other Income (expense). For additional information, see Notes 2, 3 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor fiscal year 2021, our increase in the number of ARR Customers and our ARR Net Retention Rate greater than 100% was driven by our increased spending on sales and marketing activities, the geographical expansion of our sales efforts into new countries and/or regions and the development and rollout of new data solutions.\n\u2022the market value of companies engaged in a substantially similar business;\n\u2022ARR\n\u2022Predictive solutions: Big data, AI, and ML algorithms applied to fused data sets to create predictive analytics and insights; and\nOur principal sources of liquidity to fund our operations are from cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $109.3 million as of December 31, 2021, mainly from net proceeds from the Merger, borrowings available under the FP Term Loan (as defined below) and the issuance of convertible notes. Of this $109.3 million, approximately $11.6 million was held outside of the United States. These amounts compare to cash and cash equivalents of $15.6 million as of December 31, 2020, of which $5.2 million was held outside of the United States. These amounts are exclusive of restricted cash which totaled $0.4 million as of December 31, 2021, and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2020. Since our inception, we have been in an operating cash flow deficit as we have made significant investments in our technology infrastructure, built out our research and development foundation, grown sales and marketing resources to drive revenue, and scaled general and administrative functions to enable operating effectiveness.\nWe continue to experience foreign currency fluctuations as we re-measure foreign currency denominated transactions and balances into the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Our results of operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the Euro, British Pound, Singapore Dollar and Canadian Dollar. We may continue to experience favorable or adverse foreign currency exchange impacts due to volatility in these currencies relative to their respective functional currencies.\nIn December 2021, our satellite constellation covered the earth over 200 times per day on average and our global ground station network performed over 2,300 contacts each day on average, reliably and resiliently collecting data with low latency. Our cloud-based data infrastructure processed five terabytes of data each day on average in December 2021, in creating our proprietary data analytics solutions. We provide customers these solutions through an API infrastructure that delivers approximately one terabyte of data each day to our customers, as of December 31, 2021. The global data we collect includes data that can only be captured from space with no terrestrial alternatives. We collect this data once and can then sell it an unlimited number of times across a broad and growing set of industries, including weather, aviation and maritime, with global coverage, real-time and near real-time data that can be easily integrated into our customers' operations.\nWhile we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods primarily due to higher headcount as we continue to invest in the development of our solutions offerings and new technologies, we expect research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in future periods as our revenue growth exceeds our growth in research and development spend.\n\u2022ARR Solution Customers\nThe total outstanding principal amount of each tranche was due and payable five years after the borrowing date for such tranche. The initial tranche of EUR 5.0 million did not accrue interest. The second tranche of EUR 7.0 million accrued interest at a rate equal to EURIBOR plus 5.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. If borrowed, the third tranche of EUR 8.0 million would have accrued interest at a rate equal to EURIBOR plus 10.0% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. We were also required to pay a commitment fee equal to 1.00% per annum of the undrawn term loan commitments from the one-year anniversary of the finance contract through the expiration of the commitments in January 2023.\nNet cash used in operating activities in fiscal year 2021 was $58.0 million. This reflected our net loss of $19.3 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $36.3 million, and a net decrease in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.2 million. Non-cash items primarily included $11.6 million of stock-based compensation,\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2021 was $270.5 million. This was primarily driven by $264.8 million of proceeds from the Merger, $70.5 million of proceeds from the FP and SIF loan transactions, $20.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, and $1.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, offset by payments of $31.8 million for merger and acquisitions costs related to the reverse recapitalization, repayments of $29.6 million to EIB and Eastward Capital, $19.9 million to settle the EIB warrants, and payments of $4.7 million for debt issuance costs related to the FP loan.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Earnout Liability. Change in Fair Value of Contingent Earnout Liability includes mark-to-market adjustments to reflect changes in fair value of the contingent earnout liability.\nStock-Based Compensation\nAnnual Recurring Revenue\nAdditionally, we are a smaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (i) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as", "item_7_tables":

points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Spire is a global provider of space-based data, analytics and space services. They own and operate a large satellite constellation and ground station network to collect proprietary space-based data.\n\n- For 2021, total revenue was $43.4 million, up 52% from 2020. Excluding revenue from the acquisition of exactEarth, organic revenue grew 47%. \n\n- As of December 31, 2021, annual recurring revenue (ARR) was $70.8 million, up 96% year-over-year. Organic ARR grew 44%.\n\n- Key metrics like number of ARR customers and ARR solution customers showed strong growth in 2021, driven by expanding into new industries and geographies. \n\n- Operating expenses increased significantly in 2021, driven by investments in growth like headcount increases in R&D and sales/marketing. Net loss was $19.3 million in 2021 compared to $32.5 million in 2020.\n\n- In 2021, Spire acquired exactEarth for $129 million to accelerate growth in maritime data solutions. They also completed a merger with NavSight which provided $264.8 million in cash proceeds. \n\n- Spire has been cash flow negative as they invest in growth, but raised significant funding in 2021 through the merger, debt facilities, and convertible notes. They ended 2021 with $109.3 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nIn summary, Spire showed strong revenue and ARR growth in 2021 as they invested in expansion, completed two major transactions, and raised significant capital to fund their growth strategy. But those growth investments also increased operating expenses and cash burn."}
