If the payment date of the liability is longer than one year, the amount is initially recorded net of a discount, which is amortized as an expense each period. In a period where the acquired company is expected to perform better than the previous estimate, the liability will be increased resulting in additional expense; and in a period when the acquired company is expected to perform worse than the previous estimate, the liability will be decreased resulting in income.

Revenue is also derived from \u00e0 la carte features, where users pay a fee for a specific action or event, and from online advertisers who pay to reach our large audiences.\nANGI Homeservices revenue is primarily derived from consumer connection revenue, which includes fees paid by service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the professional ultimately provides the requested service) and membership subscription fees paid by service professionals. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon certain factors including the service requested, type of match (such as Instant Booking, Instant Connect, same day service or next day service) and geographic location of service. Effective with the Combination (described below), revenue is also derived from Angie's List sales of time-based advertising to service professionals and membership subscription fees from consumers.\nA substantial portion of the revenue from our Applications and Publishing segments is derived from online advertising, most of which is attributable to our services agreement with Google Inc. (\"Google\"). The Company's services agreement became effective on April 1, 2016, following the expiration of the previous services agreement. The services agreement expires on March 31, 2020; however, the Company may choose to terminate the agreement effective March 31, 2019. The services agreement requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google, and Google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice. Any such updates could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenue earned from Google was $740.7 million, $824.4 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenue earned from Google represents 83%, 87% and 94% of Applications revenue and 71%, 73% and 83% of Publishing revenue, respectively.\nThe revenue earned by our Video segment is derived from subscriptions, media production and distribution, and advertising.\nThe Princeton Review's revenue was primarily earned from fees received directly from students for in-person and online test preparation classes, access to online test preparation materials and individual tutoring services. ShoeBuy's revenue was derived principally from merchandise sales. PriceRunner's revenue was derived principally from advertising.\nStrategic Partnerships, Advertiser Relationships and Online Advertising\nA meaningful portion of the Company's revenue is attributable to the services agreement with Google described above. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenue earned from Google represents 22%, 26% and 40%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue.\nWe pay traffic acquisition costs, which consist of fees paid to Apple and Google related to the distribution and the facilitation of in-app purchases of product features and payments made to partners who distribute our Partnerships customized browser-based applications and who integrate our paid listings into their websites. We also pay to market and distribute our services on third-party distribution channels, such as search engines and social media websites such as Facebook. In addition, some of our businesses manage affiliate programs, pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned. These distribution channels might also offer their own services and products, as well as those of other third parties, which compete with those we offer.\nWe market and offer our services and products to consumers through branded websites, allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner. We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses.\n2017 Developments\nCombination and Acquisitions\nOn October 18, 2017, Vimeo acquired Livestream, a leading live video solution that powers millions of events a year.\nOn September 29, 2017, the Company's HomeAdvisor segment and Angie's List, Inc. (\"Angie's List\") combined under a new publicly traded company called ANGI Homeservices Inc. (the \"Combination\"). At December 31, 2017, IAC owned 86.9% and 98.5% of the economic and voting interest, respectively, of ANGI Homeservices. See \"Note 4-Business Combination\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information related to the Combination. In connection with the Combination, the Company changed the name of its HomeAdvisor segment to ANGI Homeservices and year-over-year comparisons for financial results for this segment are to the historical results of the HomeAdvisor segment (adjusted to reflect corporate allocations from IAC). During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $44.1 million in costs related to this transaction (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) as well as deferred revenue write-offs of $7.8 million. The Company expects the remaining aggregate amount of transaction-related expenses, including deferred revenue write-offs, during 2018 to be in the range of $10 million to $20 million. The Company also incurred $122.1 million in stock-based compensation expense during 2017 related to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor vested and unvested equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards, the expense related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards and the acceleration of certain Angie's List equity awards resulting from the termination of employees in connection with the Combination. Stock-based compensation expense arising from the Combination is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2018.\nHomeAdvisor acquired controlling interests in MyBuilder Limited (\"MyBuilder\") on March 24, 2017, and HomeStars Inc. (\"HomeStars\") on February 8, 2017, leading home services platforms in the United Kingdom and Canada, respectively.\nFinancing Transactions\nOn December 4, 2017, Match Group completed a private offering of $450 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.00% Senior Notes due December 15, 2027. The proceeds from these notes, along with cash on hand, were used to redeem the outstanding balance of the Match Group 6.75% Senior Notes of $445.2 million on December 17, 2017.\nOn November 1, 2017, ANGI Homeservices borrowed $275 million under a five-year term loan facility.\nOn October 2, 2017, a finance subsidiary of the Company issued $517.5 million aggregate principal amount of Exchangeable Notes due October 1, 2022, which notes are guaranteed by the Company and are exchangeable into shares of the Company's common stock. The proceeds from these notes were, in part, loaned to IAC, which repaid the outstanding balance of its 4.875% Senior Notes of $361.9 million on November 30, 2017. Each $1,000 of principal of the Exchangeable Notes is exchangeable for 6.5713 shares of the Company's common stock, which is equivalent to an exchange price of approximately $152.18 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.\nOn August 14, 2017, Match Group increased its Term Loan by $75 million to $425 million, repriced the outstanding balance at LIBOR plus 2.50% and reduced the LIBOR floor to 0.00%. Previously, the interest charged on the Match Group Term Loan was LIBOR plus 3.25%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%.\nOther Developments\nDuring 2017, the Company repurchased 0.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of $69.73 per share, or $50.1 million in aggregate.\nOn October 23, 2017, Match Group sold a cost method investment for net proceeds of $60.2 million. The gain on sale of $9.1 million is included in \"Other (expense) income, net\" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nIn July 2017, Match Group elected to convert all outstanding equity awards of its wholly-owned subsidiary Tinder, which awards were primarily held by current and former Tinder employees, to stock options of Match Group (the \"Tinder Equity Plan Settlement\"). Subsequently, during 2017, Match Group made cash payments of approximately $520 million to cover both withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees exercising these converted awards, as these awards were net settled, and the purchase of certain fully vested awards.\nOn March 31, 2017, Match Group sold its non-dating business, consisting of The Princeton Review. The non-dating business does not meet the threshold to be reflected as a discontinued operation at the IAC level. The Company moved the non-dating business to its Other\u201d segment effective March 31, 2017 and prior period segment data has been recast to conform to this presentation.\n2017 Consolidated Results\nIn 2017, the Company's revenue increased $167.4 million, or 5%, operating income increased $221.1 million from a loss of $32.6 million in the prior year and Adjusted EBITDA grew $74.1 million, or 15%. Revenue increased due primarily to an increase of $237.5 million from ANGI Homeservices due, in part, to the Combination, growth of $212.6 million from Match Group and $48.3 million from Video, partially offset by a decline of $259.4 million from Other due to the sales of ShoeBuy, The Princeton Review and PriceRunner on December 30, 2016, March 31, 2017 and March 18, 2016, respectively, and a decline of $45.5 million from Publishing primarily due to the effects of the Google contract. The operating income increase was due primarily to the inclusion in 2016 of a $275.4 million goodwill impairment charge at Publishing, an increase of $74.1 million in Adjusted EBITDA, described below, and a decrease of $37.3 million in amortization of intangibles, partially offset by an increase of $159.8 million in stock-based compensation expense due, in part, to the Combination. The goodwill impairment charge at Publishing in 2016 was driven by the impact from the Google contract, traffic trends and monetization challenges. The Adjusted EBITDA increase was due primarily to growth of $65.6 million from Match Group, a profit from Publishing of $31.5 million in 2017 compared to a loss of $7.6 million in 2016 and growth of $4.5 million from Applications, partially offset by increased losses of $14.5 million from Corporate, $9.2 million from Video and a decline of $8.0 million from ANGI Homeservices due primarily to costs of $44.1 million (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) and deferred revenue write-offs of $7.8 million related to the Combination.\nOther events affecting year-over-year comparability that occurred prior to 2017 include:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i)\n</td> <td>the sale of ASKfm on June 30, 2016 (reflected in the Publishing segment)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ii)\n</td> <td>acquisitions in 2016 and 2015:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>MyHammer Holding AG (\"MyHammer\") on November 3, 2016 (reflected in the ANGI Homeservices segment)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>PlentyOfFish on October 28, 2015 (reflected in the Match Group segment); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pairs (also known as Eureka) on April 24, 2015 (reflected in the Match Group segment).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iii)\n</td> <td>costs of $4.9 million and $16.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the consolidation and streamlining of technology systems and European operations at the Match Group segment.

Beginning in the second quarter of 2017, as a result of the sales of these businesses, the Other segment does not include any financial results.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nMatch Group revenue increased 19% driven by International Direct Revenue growth of $146.3 million, or 38%, and North America Direct Revenue growth of $67.6 million, or 10%. Both International and North America Direct Revenue growth were driven by higher Average Subscribers, up 33% and 9%, respectively, due primarily to continued growth in Subscribers at Tinder. Total ARPU increased 1%.\nANGI Homeservices revenue increased 48% driven by growth of $152.5 million, or 36%, at Marketplace (formerly HomeAdvisor Domestic) and 55% at the European business. Marketplace Revenue growth was driven by a 37% increase in Marketplace Service Requests to 18.1 million and a 26% increase in Marketplace Paying SPs to 181,000. Revenue growth at the European business was driven by the acquisitions of controlling interests in MyHammer on November 3, 2016 and MyBuilder on March 24, 2017, as well as by organic growth across other regions. Revenue in 2017 includes a contribution of $58.9 million from Angie's List since the date of the Combination, which reflects a reduction in revenue of $7.8 million due to the write-off of deferred revenue related to the Combination.\nVideo revenue increased 21% driven by the sales of The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) and The Legacy of a Whitetail Deer Hunter and the release of Lady Bird at IAC Films and strong growth at Vimeo, which had ending subscribers of 873,000, an increase of 14% year-over-year, partially offset by a decline at Electus.\nApplications revenue decreased 4% due to a decrease of $37.8 million, or 27%, in Partnerships, partially offset by an increase of $11.7 million, or 3%, in Consumer. Partnerships revenue continued to decline due primarily to the loss of certain partners. The growth in Consumer was due primarily to growth of 37% at Apalon, driven by higher advertising and subscription revenue, and growth at SlimWare, driven by higher subscription revenue, partially offset by lower revenue per query at the Consumer desktop applications business. Apalon and SlimWare together comprised 16% of total Applications revenue in 2017.\nPublishing revenue decreased 11% due to $58.8 million, or 20%, lower Ask & Other revenue, partially offset by $13.3 million, or 12%, higher Premium Brands revenue. Ask & Other revenue decreased due to declines in paid traffic primarily as a result of the Google contract. Premium Brands revenue increase was due to growth at Investopedia and Dotdash due to an increase in organic traffic and advertising revenue.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nMatch Group revenue increased 23% driven by higher Average Subscribers at both North America and International, up 22% and 46%, respectively, due primarily to growth in Subscribers at Tinder and the contribution from the 2015 acquisition of PlentyOfFish. This revenue growth was partially offset by a 6% decline in ARPU. North America and International ARPU\ndecreased 5% and 7%, respectively, due primarily to the continued mix shift towards lower ARPU brands, including Tinder and PlentyOfFish, which had lower price points compared to Match Group's more established brands. North America ARPU decline was partially offset by an increase in mix-adjusted rates.\nANGI Homeservices revenue increased 38% due primarily to 44% growth at Marketplace and 18% growth at the European business. Marketplace Revenue growth was driven by a 34% increase in Marketplace Service Requests to 13.2 million and a 41% increase in Marketplace Paying SPs to 143,000. Revenue growth at the European business was driven by organic growth across all regions as well as the acquisition of a controlling interest in MyHammer.\nVideo revenue increased 7% due primarily to growth at Electus, Vimeo and Daily Burn, partially offset by lower revenue from IAC Films as 2015 benefited from the release of the movie While We're Young. Vimeo's ending subscribers were 768,000, an increase of 14%, compared to 2015.\nApplications revenue decreased 21% due to a 39% decline in Partnerships and a 12% decline in Consumer. Partnerships revenue decreased due primarily to the loss of certain partners. The Consumer decline was driven by lower search revenue from our downloadable desktop applications due primarily to lower monetization, partially offset by strong growth at Apalon and SlimWare, which together comprised 12% of total Applications revenue in 2016.\nPublishing revenue decreased 41% due to 54% lower Ask & Other revenue and 25% lower Premium Brands revenue. Ask & Other revenue decreased due to a decline in revenue at Ask Media Group primarily as a result of the new Google contract, which became effective April 1, 2016, as well as declines from certain other legacy businesses. Premium Brands revenue decreased due primarily to declines in monetization, mainly attributable to the new Google contract and organic traffic at Dotdash, partially offset by strong growth at Investopedia and The Daily Beast.\nOther revenue decreased 4% due to the sale of PriceRunner on March 18, 2016 and a 6% decrease in revenue at The Princeton Review, partially offset by growth at ShoeBuy. The decrease in revenue at The Princeton Review was primarily due to fewer in-person SAT test preparation courses and in-person tutoring sessions, partially offset by an increase in online and self-paced services.\nCost of revenue\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation shown separately below)\n</td> <td>$651,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(104,722)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$755,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(22,431)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$778,161\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nCost of revenue in 2017 decreased from 2016 due to decreases of $169.4 million from Other, $31.6 million from Publishing and $20.9 million from Applications, partially offset by increases of $83.9 million from Match Group, $25.9 million from Video and $8.2 million from ANGI Homeservices.\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Other decrease was due to the sales of ShoeBuy and The Princeton Review.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Publishing decrease was due primarily to reductions of $15.2 million in traffic acquisition costs driven by a decline in revenue at Ask & Other, $8.4 million in rent expense due to vacating a data center in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $6.5 million in content costs due primarily to Dotdash due, in part, to its vertical brand strategy which launched in the second quarter of 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Applications decrease was due primarily to a reduction of $16.6 million in traffic acquisition costs driven by a decline in revenue at Partnerships and a decrease of $2.9 million in compensation due, in part, to the reductions in workforce in 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Match Group increase was due primarily to increases of $75.4 million in in-app purchase fees and $5.9 million in hosting fees.

General and administrative expense also includes increases of $9.2 million in bad debt expense due, in part, to higher Marketplace Revenue, $3.9 million in outsourced customer service expense and $3.2 million in software license and maintenance costs, as well as $9.8 million of expense from acquisitions made prior to the Combination.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Match Group increase was due primarily to an increase of $20.6 million in compensation, a change of $14.5 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments (expense of $5.3 million in 2017 versus income of $9.2 million in 2016) and an increase of $6.8 million in professional fees.

Not meaningful.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nOperating income in 2017 increased from a loss in 2016 due primarily to the inclusion in 2016 of a $275.4 million goodwill impairment charge at Publishing, an increase of $74.1 million in Adjusted EBITDA described below, and a decrease of $37.3 million in amortization of intangibles, partially offset by an increase of $159.8 million in stock-based compensation expense, a change of $3.2 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments and an increase of $2.6 million in depreciation expense. The goodwill impairment charge at Publishing in 2016 was driven by the impact from the\nGoogle contract, traffic trends and monetization challenges. The decrease in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to lower expense in 2017 as a result of a Publishing trade name and certain intangible assets from the PlentyOfFish acquisition now being fully amortized, partially offset by expense in 2017 related to the Combination. Amortization of intangibles was further impacted by the inclusion of an impairment charge in 2016 of $11.6 million related to certain Publishing indefinite-lived trade names. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to an increase of $140.3 million at ANGI Homeservices due primarily to the modification and acceleration charges related to the Combination, as well as an increase in expense related to a subsidiary denominated equity award held by a non-employee, which award was settled during the third quarter of 2017, and the issuance of new equity awards since 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, there was $423.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.5 years.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nOperating income in 2016 decreased to a loss from 2015 despite an increase of $15.4 million in Adjusted EBITDA described below, due primarily to increases of $261.3 million in goodwill impairment charges, $9.5 million in depreciation and a change of $18.0 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, partially offset by a decrease of $60.5 million in amortization of intangibles. The increase in goodwill impairment charges was due to the write-off of goodwill of $275.4 million at Publishing in 2016 compared to the write-off of goodwill of $14.1 million at ShoeBuy in 2015. The goodwill impairment charge at Publishing was driven by the impact from the new Google contract, which was effective April 1, 2016, traffic trends and monetization challenges and the corresponding impact on the then estimated fair value. The Publishing goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the second quarter of 2016. The change in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments was primarily the result of expense in 2016 of $2.6 million versus income of $15.5 million in 2015. The decrease in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to a reduction in impairment charges during 2016, partially offset by $23.3 million in amortization related to a change in classification of a Publishing trade name from an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a definite-lived intangible asset, effective April 1, 2016. The Company recorded an impairment charge in 2016 of $11.6 million compared to an impairment charge in 2015 of $88.0 million all related to certain Publishing indefinite-lived trade names.\nFor a detailed description of the Publishing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, see \"Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 -

Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nMatch Group Adjusted EBITDA increased 16% due primarily to an increase of $212.6 million in revenue and lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue due to the ongoing product mix towards brands with lower marketing spend and a reduction in marketing spend at Match Group's affinity brands, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue, general and administrative expense and product development expense. General and administrative expense and product development expense increased due, in part, to expense of $12.7 million associated with the employer portion of payroll taxes and professional fees resulting from the Tinder Equity Plan Settlement.\nANGI Homeservices Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $37.9 million, despite an increase of $237.5 million in revenue, due primarily to an increase in selling and marketing expense, higher compensation expense due, in part, to increase headcount, the inclusion in 2017 of $44.1 million in costs related to the Combination (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) and increases in bad debt expense due, in part, to higher Marketplace Revenue, outsourced customer service expense and software license and maintenance costs. The higher losses at the European businesses were driven primarily by the European expansion strategy, including increased investment in online and offline marketing and higher compensation costs. Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 was further impacted by write-offs of deferred revenue related to the Combination of $7.8 million and the acquisition of HomeStars of $0.7 million.\nVideo Adjusted EBITDA loss increased 43%, despite higher revenue, due to declines at Electus and higher losses from Vimeo (including the impact of deferred revenue write-offs of $2.1 million related to acquisition of Livestream), partially offset by the contribution from IAC Films and reduced losses at Daily Burn. The increased Adjusted EBITDA loss at Vimeo, despite higher revenue, reflects our investments in marketing and product development to grow the business.\nApplications Adjusted EBITDA increased 3%, despite a 4% decrease in revenue, due primarily to lower operating costs. Adjusted EBITDA in 2016 includes $2.6 million in restructuring costs.\nPublishing Adjusted EBITDA improved to a profit of $31.5 million in 2017 from a loss of $7.6 million in 2016, despite lower revenue, due primarily to lower operating costs resulting from restructurings in 2016 and the sale of ASKfm. Results in 2016 included $15.6 million in restructuring charges related to vacating a data center and severance costs in an effort to reduce costs in light of significant declines in revenue from the new Google contract.\nCorporate Adjusted EBITDA loss increased $14.5 million due primarily to higher compensation costs and professional fees.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nMatch Group Adjusted EBITDA increased 42% due primarily to higher revenue and a decrease in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue as the product mix continued to shift towards brands with lower marketing spend, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue driven by a significant increase in in-app purchase fees. Additionally, there were $11.8 million of lower costs in 2016 related to the consolidation and streamlining of technology systems and European operations ($4.9 million in 2016 compared to $16.8 million in 2015).\nANGI Homeservices Adjusted EBITDA increased 174% due primarily to higher revenue, partially offset by an increased investment in online and offline marketing and $2.1 million in transaction-related costs. Adjusted EBITDA was further impacted by higher compensation due primarily to increased headcount and an increase in bad debt expense due to higher Marketplace Revenue.\nVideo Adjusted EBITDA loss improved 45% due primarily to reduced losses at Vimeo and Daily Burn and increased profits at Electus.\nApplications Adjusted EBITDA decreased 28% due primarily to lower revenue, partially offset by decreases in cost of revenue and selling and marketing expense. Adjusted EBITDA was further impacted by $2.6 million in restructuring charges.\nPublishing Adjusted EBITDA declined to a loss in 2016 due primarily to lower revenue and $15.6 million in restructuring charges related to vacating a data center and severance costs during 2016 in an effort to reduce costs in light of significant declines in revenue from the new Google contract ($9.2 million in cost of revenue, $3.1 million in selling and marketing expense, $2.3 million in general and administrative expense and $1.2 million in product development expense). Adjusted EBITDA was further impacted by decreases in selling and marketing expense, cost of revenue and general and administrative expense exclusive of the restructuring charges.\nOther Adjusted EBITDA decreased 62% due to the sale of PriceRunner in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by profits from The Princeton Review in 2016 and improved Adjusted EBITDA at ShoeBuy resulting from increased revenue.\nCorporate Adjusted EBITDA loss was essentially flat compared to 2015.\nInterest expense\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$105,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(3,815)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$35,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,636\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense in 2017 decreased from 2016 due primarily to lower interest expense of $16.0 million related to the 2016 prepayment and 2017 repricing of the Match Group Term Loan and $6.6 million related to the repayment of the outstanding balances of the 4.875% Senior Notes and Match Group 6.75% Senior Notes in the fourth quarter of 2017. Partially offsetting these decreases are increases of $10.9 million of interest expense associated with the Match Group 6.375% Senior Notes, $5.2 million from the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes, $1.8 million related to the Match Group 5.00% Senior Notes and $1.7 million from the ANGI Homeservices Term Loan.\nInterest expense in 2016 increased from 2015 due to the $800 million of borrowings under the Match Group Term Loan in November 2015, of which $400 million was refinanced on June 1, 2016 with the Match Group 6.375% Senior Notes, and the 2% higher interest rate associated with the Match Group 6.75% Senior Notes which were issued in exchange for a substantially like amount of 4.75% Senior Notes, partially offset by lower interest expense due to repurchases and redemptions of the

Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, on January 1, 2017 and foreign income taxed at lower rates, partially offset by the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) discussed below. Under ASU No. 2016-09, excess tax benefits generated by the exercise, purchase or settlement of stock-based awards of $361.8 million in 2017 are recognized as a reduction to the income tax provision rather than as an increase to additional paid-in capital.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Act. The Tax Act subjects to U.S. taxation certain previously deferred earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 ( Transition Tax\u201d) and implements a number of changes that take effect on January 1, 2018, including but not limited to, a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and a new minimum tax on intangible income earned by foreign subsidiaries. The Company's income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes an expense of $63.8 million related to the Tax Act, of which, $62.7 million relates to the Transition Tax and $1.1 million relates to the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate. The Company has sufficient current year net operating losses to offset the taxable income resulting from the Transition Tax and, therefore, will not be required to pay the one-time Transition Tax.\nThe Transition Tax on deemed repatriated foreign earnings is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits (\"E&P\") of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. To determine the amount of the Transition Tax, the Company must determine, among other factors, the amount of post-1986 E&P of its foreign subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. The Company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the Transition Tax and has recorded a provisional transition tax expense of $62.7 million. Any adjustment of the Company's provisional tax expense will be reflected as a change in estimate in its results in the period in which the change in estimate is made in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company is continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of the Transition Tax and expects to finalize its calculation prior to the filing of its U.S. federal tax return, which is due on October 15, 2018. The additional information includes, but is not limited to, the allocation and sourcing of income and deductions in 2017 for purposes of calculating the utilization of foreign tax credits. In addition, our estimates may also be impacted and adjusted as the law is clarified and additional guidance is issued at the federal and state levels.\nIn 2016, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $64.9 million, which represented an effective income tax rate of 80%. The effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to foreign income taxed at lower rates and the non-taxable gain on the sale of ShoeBuy, partially offset by the non-deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge at the Publishing segment.\nIn 2015, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $29.5 million, which represented an effective income tax rate of 21%. The effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the realization of certain deferred tax assets, foreign income taxed at lower rates, the non-taxable gain on contingent consideration fair value adjustments, and a reduction in tax reserves and related interest due to the expiration of statutes of limitations, partially offset by a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and unbenefited losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries.\nFor further details of income tax matters, see \"Note 3-Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nNet (earnings) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\nNoncontrolling interests represent the noncontrolling holders' percentage share of earnings or losses from the subsidiaries in which the Company holds a majority, but less than 100%, ownership interest and the results of which are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (earnings) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>$(53,084)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(27,955)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(25,129)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(31,227)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$6,098\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2017 primarily represents the publicly-held interest in Match Group's earnings, partially offset by ANGI Homeservices losses.\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2016 primarily represented the proportionate share of the noncontrolling holders' ownership in Match Group.\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2015 primarily represented the proportionate share of the noncontrolling holders' ownership in certain subsidiaries within the Video, ANGI Homeservices and Publishing segments and Match Group.\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING\nIAC reports Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. IAC endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.\nDefinition of Non-GAAP Measure\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements. We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments, and this measure is one of the primary metrics by which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses.\nFor a reconciliation of operating income (loss) by reportable segment and net (loss) earnings attributable to IAC shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 see \"Note 14-Segment Information\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nNon-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded From Non-GAAP Measure\nStock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions (including the Combination), of stock options, restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), performance-based RSUs and market-based awards. These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method; however, performance-based RSUs and market-based awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market condition(s) have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period). Upon the exercise of stock options and market-based stock options, the awards are gross settled, and the vesting of RSUs, performance-based RSUs and market-based awards RSUs, the awards are settled, on a net basis, with the Company remitting the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds.\nDepreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.\nAmortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions (including the Combination). At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as contractor and service professional relationships, technology, customer lists and user base, content, trade names and membership, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.\nGains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business.\nFINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFinancial Position\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

Non-cash adjustments include stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, goodwill impairments, deferred income taxes, acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, gains from the sale of businesses and investments and a real estate transaction, impairments of long-term investments and bad debt expense.\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $264.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, $74.3 million of depreciation, $42.1 million of amortization of intangibles, $28.9 million of bad debt expense, $12.2 million of impairments on long-term investments, and $43.6 million of other adjustments, which primarily consist of losses on bond redemptions and net foreign currency exchange losses, partially offset by $285.3 million of deferred income taxes and $32.7 million of net gains from the sale of businesses and investments. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to the net operating loss created primarily by excess tax benefits of $361.8 million related to stock-based awards and the modification charge for the conversion and acceleration of stock-based awards in connection with the Combination, partially offset by the provisional Transition Tax. The decrease from changes in working capital consists primarily of an increase in accounts receivable of $115.2 million and a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities of $14.1 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $39.2 million. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to (i) the timing of cash receipts and revenue increasingly sourced through mobile app stores at Match Group, which are settled more slowly than traditional credit cards; and (ii) revenue growth at ANGI Homeservices. The decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities is due to: (i) a decrease at Match Group due to the cash settlement of former subsidiary denominated equity awards held by a non-employee, (ii) a decrease in accrued employee compensation mainly related to the timing of payments of cash bonuses, partially offset by (iii) an increase\nin accrued advertising at Match Group. The increase in deferred revenue is due mainly to growth in subscription sales at Match Group and Vimeo, as well as growth in subscription sales and time-based advertising to service professionals at ANGI Homeservices, partially offset by decreases at Electus and Notional mainly due to the delivery of programming related to various production deals.\nNet cash provided by investing activities includes net proceeds from sale of businesses and investments of $185.8 million, which is primarily related to the sale of The Princeton Review and a Match Group cost method investment, and proceeds (net of purchases) of marketable debt securities of $84.5 million, partially offset by acquisitions and purchases of investments of $158.2 million, which includes Livestream, MyBuilder, Angie's List and HomeStars acquisitions, and capital expenditures of $75.5 million, primarily related to investments in development of capitalized software at Match Group and ANGI Homeservices to support their products and services, computer hardware and the Company's purchase of a 50% ownership interest in an aircraft as a replacement for an existing 50% interest in a previously owned aircraft, which was sold on February 13, 2018.\nNet cash used in financing activities includes principal payments made on Match Group and IAC debt of $445.2 million and $393.5 million, respectively, the payment of $272.5 million for the purchase of certain fully vested stock-based awards, the payment of $254.2 million, $93.8 million and $10.1 million for withholding taxes paid on behalf of Match Group, IAC and ANGI Homeservices employees, respectively, on net settled stock-based awards, $74.4 million for the Exchangeable Notes hedge, $56.4 million for the repurchase of 0.8 million shares of IAC common stock at an average price of $69.24 per share, $33.7 million of debt issuance costs primarily related to the Exchangeable Notes and the 5.00% Match Group Senior Notes, $27.3 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration payments (included in operating activities is $11.1 million for an acquisition-related contingent consideration payment made in excess of the amount initially recognized at the time of acquisition) and $15.4 million for the purchase of noncontrolling interests, partially offset by $525.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of Match Group debt, $517.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes, $275.0 million in proceeds from the ANGI Homeservices Term Loan, $82.4 million and $59.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of IAC and Match Group common stock, respectively, pursuant to stock-based awards, $23.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of warrants, a $20.1 million decrease in restricted cash that relates to settled IAC bond redemptions and $10.6 million of funds returned from escrow for the MyHammer tender offer.\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $275.4 million of goodwill impairment at the Publishing segment, $104.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, $79.4 million of amortization of intangibles, $71.7 million of depreciation, $17.7 million of bad debt expense, and $10.7 million of impairments on long-term investments, partially offset by $119.2 million of deferred income taxes and $51.0 million of net gains from the sale of businesses and investments. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to the Publishing goodwill impairment. The decrease from changes in working capital consists primarily of a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities of $52.4 million, an increase in other assets of $12.9 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $35.8 million and an increase in income taxes payable and receivable of $9.0 million. The decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities is due to (i) a decrease in accrued advertising and revenue share expense at Publishing and Applications mainly due to the effect of the new Google contract, which became effective April 1, 2016, (ii) a decrease in VAT payables related mainly to decreases in international revenue at Publishing, and (iii) decreases in payables at Match Group due to the timing of payments. The increase in other assets is primarily related to an increase in production costs at IAC Films. The increase in deferred revenue is mainly due to growth in subscription sales at Match Group, ANGI Homeservices and Vimeo. The increase in income taxes payable and receivable is primarily due to receipt of 2015 capital loss refund in 2016 and 2016 income tax accruals in excess of 2016 income tax payments, partially offset by payment of 2015 tax liabilities in 2016.\nNet cash provided by investing activities includes net proceeds from the sale of businesses, investments and assets of $172.2 million, which mainly relate to the sale of PriceRunner and ShoeBuy, partially offset by capital expenditures of $78.0 million, primarily related to investments in development of capitalized software at Match Group and ANGI Homeservices to support their products and services, as well as leasehold improvements and computer hardware, purchases (net of sales and maturities) of marketable debt securities of $61.6 million, and cash used in acquisitions and purchases of investments of $31.0 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities includes $450.0 million in principal payments on Match Group debt, $308.9 million for the repurchase of 6.2 million shares of IAC common stock at an average price of $49.74 per share, $126.4 million in principal payments on IAC debt and $29.8 million and $26.7 million for the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of Match Group and IAC employees, respectively, on net settled stock-based awards, partially offset by $400.0 million in\nproceeds from the issuance of Match Group debt and $39.4 million and $25.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of Match Group and IAC common stock, respectively, pursuant to stock-based awards.\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $140.0 million of amortization of intangibles, $105.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, $62.2 million of depreciation, $16.6 million of bad debt expense and $14.1 million of goodwill impairment, partially offset by $59.8 million of deferred income taxes, $34.3 million of gain on a real estate transaction, and $15.5 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. The increase from changes in working capital consists primarily of an increase in deferred revenue of $66.9 million and an increase in income taxes payable and receivable of $24.2 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $29.7 million and an increase in other assets of $21.2 million. The increase in deferred revenue was due mainly to growth in subscription sales at Match Group, Vimeo and ANGI Homeservices, increases related to acquisitions, and increases at Electus, CollegeHumor and Notional mainly due to the timing of various production deals. The increase in income taxes payable and receivable was due to 2015 income tax accruals in excess of 2015 income tax payments. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to growth in Match Group's in-app purchases sold through their mobile products and revenue growth at ANGI Homeservices. The increase in other assets was primarily due to Match Group, relating to an increase in prepaid expenses, primarily from growth and the signing of longer-term contracts, as well as an increase in VAT refund receivables in the Publishing segment.\nNet cash used in investing activities includes acquisitions and purchases of investments of $651.9 million, which includes PlentyOfFish, and capital expenditures of $62.0 million, primarily related to investments in development of capitalized software to support our products and services, and computer hardware, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities (net of purchases) of marketable securities of $125.3 million, and net proceeds from the sale of long-term investments and an asset of $9.4 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities includes $788.0 million in borrowings from the Match Group Term Loan, $428.8 million in net proceeds received from Match Group's initial public offering and $27.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of IAC common stock pursuant to stock-based awards, partially offset by $200.0 million used for the repurchase of 3.0 million shares of common stock at an average price of $67.68 per share, $113.2 million related to the payment of cash dividends to IAC shareholders, $80.0 million for the early redemption of the Liberty Bonds, $65.7 million for the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of IAC employees on net settled stock-based awards, $32.2 million for the purchase of noncontrolling interests, $23.4 million for the purchase of certain fully vested stock-based awards and $19.1 million of debt issuance costs primarily associated with the Match Group Term Loan and revolving credit facility.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents as well as cash flows generated from operations. IAC's consolidated cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 were $1.6 billion, of which $272.6 million was held by Match Group and $221.5 million was held by ANGI Homeservices. The Company generated $416.7 million of operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2017, of which $321.1 million was generated by Match Group and $41.8 million was generated by ANGI Homeservices. Each of Match Group and ANGI Homeservices is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and board of directors and has no obligation to provide the Company with funds. As a result, we cannot freely access the cash of Match Group and ANGI Homeservices and their respective subsidiaries. In addition, agreements governing Match Group's indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or distributions in the event a default has occurred or Match Group's leverage ratio (as defined in the Match Group Indentures) exceeds 5.0 to 1.0. In addition, the agreement governing ANGI Homeservices' Term Loan limits the payment of dividends or distributions in the event a default has occurred or ANGI Homeservices' leverage ratio (as defined in the Term Loan facility) exceeds 4.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2017, there are no restrictions on Match Group's or ANGI Homeservices' ability to pay dividends under these debt agreements.\nIAC has a $300 million revolving credit facility that expires on October 7, 2020. Match Group has a $500 million revolving credit facility that expires on October 7, 2020. At December 31, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under the IAC Credit Facility or the Match Group Credit Facility.\nThe Company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations. The Company's 2018 capital expenditures are expected to be higher than 2017 by approximately 20% to 25%, driven, in part, by higher capital expenditures for ANGI Homeservices and Match Group related to the\ndevelopment of capitalized software to support our products and services and for ANGI Homeservices' new corporate headquarters, partially offset by lower capital expenditures at Corporate.\nAt December 31, 2017, IAC had 8.6 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization. IAC may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors IAC management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook.\nIn May 2017, the Board of Directors of Match Group authorized Match Group to repurchase up to 6 million shares of its common stock. Match Group has not repurchased any shares related to this repurchase authorization.\nThe Company has granted stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights denominated in the equity of certain non-publicly traded subsidiaries to employees and management of those subsidiaries. These equity awards vest over a period of years or upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events. The value of the stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights is tied to the value of the common stock of these subsidiaries. Accordingly, these interests only have value to the extent the relevant business appreciates in value above the initial value utilized to determine the exercise price. These interests can have significant value in the event of significant appreciation. The interests are ultimately settled in IAC common stock with fair market value generally determined by negotiation or arbitration. These equity awards are settled on a net basis, with the award holder entitled to receive a payment in IAC shares equal to the intrinsic value of the award at exercise less an amount equal to the required cash tax withholding payment. The number of shares ultimately needed to settle these awards may vary significantly as a result of both movements in our stock price and a determination of fair value of the relevant subsidiary that is different than our estimate. The number of IAC common shares that would be required to settle these interests, other than for Match Group and ANGI Homeservices subsidiaries, at current estimated fair values, including vested and unvested interests, at December 31, 2017 is 0.1 million shares. Withholding taxes, which will be paid by the Company on behalf of the employees upon exercise, would have been $15.2 million at December 31, 2017, assuming a 50% withholding rate.\nIn July 2017, Tinder, Inc. ( Tinder\u201d) was merged into Match Group and as a result, all Tinder denominated equity awards were converted into Match Group tandem stock options (\"Tandem Awards\"). All of the Tandem Awards exercised during 2017 were exercised on a net basis and settled in IAC common shares. Assuming all vested and unvested Match Group Tandem Awards outstanding on December 31, 2017 were exercised on a net basis on that date and settled using IAC stock, 0.8 million IAC common shares would have been issued in settlement. Match Group would have remitted $102.4 million in cash in withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate) on behalf of the employees and issued 3.3 million of its common shares to IAC as reimbursement.\nIn connection with the Combination, previously issued stock appreciation rights that related to common stock of HomeAdvisor (US) were converted into stock appreciation rights that are settleable in Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices. IAC has the right to settle these awards using shares of IAC common stock. Assuming all vested and unvested stock appreciation rights outstanding on December 31, 2017 were exercised on a net basis on that date and settled using IAC stock, 1.4 million IAC common shares would have been issued in settlement. ANGI Homeservices would have remitted $171.3 million in cash in withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate) on behalf of the employees and issued 16.4 million of its common shares to IAC as reimbursement.\nAs of December 31, 2017, IAC's economic and voting interest in Match Group is 81.2% and 97.6%, respectively, and in ANGI Homeservices is 86.9% and 98.5%, respectively. Certain Match Group and ANGI Homeservices equity awards can be settled either in IAC common shares or the common shares of these subsidiaries at IAC's election. The Company currently expects to settle a sufficient number of awards in IAC shares to maintain an economic interest in both Match Group and ANGI Homeservices of at least 80%.\nThe Company will not be required to pay the one-time Transition Tax under the Tax Act because of its net operating loss position. The Company does not expect to be a full U.S. federal cash income tax payer until 2021, which is in line with previous estimates. We expect the Tax Act to favorably impact our future liquidity, primarily as a result of a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which will lower our effective tax rate and annual tax liability.\nThe Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future. The Company's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. The Company's indebtedness could limit our ability to: (i) obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditure or debt service or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to make acquisitions,\ncapital expenditures, invest in other areas, such as developing business opportunities. The Company may make additional acquisitions and investments and, as a result, the Company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater financial flexibility. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations(a)\n</td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(b)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,372,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,000,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,659,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(c)\n</td> <td>38,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>211,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>360,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(d)\n</td> <td>21,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,415,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,212,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,052,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>The Company has excluded $37.2 million in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest from the table above as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities might be paid.

Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others. What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.\nBusiness Combinations and Contingent Consideration Arrangements\nAcquisitions are an important part of the Company's growth strategy. The Company invested $912.1 million (including the value of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock issued in connection with the Combination), $36.1 million and $650.7 million in acquisitions in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. The fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. The excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.\nIn connection with certain business combinations, the Company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price. Each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled. The contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics. The Company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, are recognized in General and administrative expense\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nRecoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is the Company's largest asset with a carrying value of $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying value of $459.1 million and $320.6 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. In performing its annual assessment, the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.\nFor the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2017, a qualitative assessment of the Match Group, ANGI Homeservices, Vimeo and Applications reporting units' goodwill was performed because the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values. The primary factors that the Company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units are described below:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Match Group's October 1, 2017 market capitalization of $6.3 billion exceeded its carrying value by more than 1100% and Match Group's strong operating performance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ANGI Homeservices' October 1, 2017 market capitalization of $5.9 billion exceeded its carrying value by more than 450% and ANGI Homeservices' strong operating performance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Company performed valuations of the Vimeo and Applications reporting units during 2017. These valuations were prepared primarily in connection with the issuance and/or settlement of equity grants that are denominated in the equity of these businesses. The valuations were prepared time proximate to, however, not as of, October 1, 2017. The fair value of each of these businesses was in excess of its October 1, 2017 carrying value.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The Company foregoes a qualitative assessment and tests the goodwill for impairment when it concludes that it is more likely than not that there may be an impairment. For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2017, the Company\nquantitatively tested the Daily Burn and Electus reporting units. The Company's quantitative test indicated that the fair value of each of these reporting units is in excess of its respective carrying value; therefore, the goodwill of these reporting units is not impaired. The Company's Publishing reporting unit has no goodwill.\nThe aggregate goodwill balance for the reporting units for which the most recent estimate of fair value is less than 120% of their carrying values is approximately $450 million.\nThe annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.\nThe fair value of the Company's reporting units is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows (\"DCF\") and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of October 1 each year. The Company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its subsidiary denominated stock based compensation plans, which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative screen. Determining fair value using a DCF analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed based on the reporting units' current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rates used in determining the fair value of the Company's reporting units ranged from 12.5% to 17.5% in 2017 and 10% to 17.5% in 2016. Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors. While a primary driver in the determination of the fair values of the Company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability, the determination of fair value is based, in part, upon the Company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.\nWhile the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying values, the Company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 1. In 2017, the Company did not quantitatively assess the Angie's List indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired through the Combination given the proximity of the September 29, 2017 transaction date to the October 1, 2017 annual test date. The Company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks. Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 11% to 16% in both 2017 and 2016, and the royalty rates used ranged from 2% to 7% in both 2017 and 2016.\nThe 2017 annual assessment did not identify any impairments. While the 2016 annual assessment did not identify any material impairments, during the second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded impairment charges equal to the entire $275.4 million balance of the Publishing reporting unit goodwill and $11.6 million related to certain Publishing indefinite-lived intangible assets. The 2015 annual assessment identified impairment charges related to certain intangible assets of the Publishing reporting unit and the goodwill on the ShoeBuy reporting unit of $88.0 million and $14.1 million, respectively.\nRecoverability and Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. In addition, the Company reviews the useful lives of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\nthat these lives may be changed. The carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $519.8 million and $341.1 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the balance of deferred tax assets (liabilities), net, is $31.3 million and $(226.3) million, respectively.\nThe Company evaluates and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. Recognition (step one) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustainable upon examination. Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. De-recognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when the Company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits of $39.7 million and $41.0 million, including interest and penalties, respectively. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Although management currently believes changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.\nThe ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.\nNo income taxes have been provided on indefinitely reinvested cash earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of $101.2 million at December 31, 2017. The estimated amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to such cash earnings would be $7.9 million.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $264.6 million, $104.8 million and $105.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Included in stock-based compensation expense in 2017 is $122.1 million related to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor vested and unvested equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards, the expense related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards and the acceleration of certain Angie's List equity awards resulting from the termination of employees in connection with the Combination. The Company estimated the fair value of stock options issued (including those modified in connection with the Combination) in 2017, 2016 and 2015 using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and, for those with a market condition, a lattice model. For stock options, including subsidiary denominated equity, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date at fair value and expensed over the vesting term. The impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one-year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $5.3 million, $20.3 million and $8.5 million, respectively. The Company also issues RSUs and performance-based RSUs. For RSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying IAC common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term. For performance-based RSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying IAC common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.\nMarketable Securities and Long-term Investments\nAt December 31, 2017, marketable securities of $5.0 million consist of commercial paper rated A1+/P1. Long-term investments at December 31, 2017 of $65.0 million include equity securities accounted for under the cost and equity methods.\nThe Company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed. Marketable securities are adjusted to fair value each\nquarter, and the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of shareholders' equity. The specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. The Company recognizes unrealized losses on marketable securities in net earnings when the losses are determined to be other-than-temporary. Additionally, the Company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis, and recognizes an impairment loss if the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary. Future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as other-than-temporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the Company's investments to decline.\nThe Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. Such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition, the rate at which the investee utilizes cash and the investee's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee's existing business model due to changing business and regulatory environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $12.2 million, $10.7 million and $6.7 million, respectively, related to cost and equity method investments.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see \"Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"", "item_7_truncated": "On March 31, 2017, Match Group sold its non-dating business, consisting of The Princeton Review. The non-dating business does not meet the threshold to be reflected as a discontinued operation at the IAC level. The Company moved the non-dating business to its Other\u201d segment effective March 31, 2017 and prior period segment data has been recast to conform to this presentation.\nInterest expense in 2017 decreased from 2016 due primarily to lower interest expense of $16.0 million related to the 2016 prepayment and 2017 repricing of the Match Group Term Loan and $6.6 million related to the repayment of the outstanding balances of the 4.875% Senior Notes and Match Group 6.75% Senior Notes in the fourth quarter of 2017. Partially offsetting these decreases are increases of $10.9 million of interest expense associated with the Match Group 6.375% Senior Notes, $5.2 million from the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes, $1.8 million related to the Match Group 5.00% Senior Notes and $1.7 million from the ANGI Homeservices Term Loan.\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product development expense\n</td> <td>$250,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$38,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$212,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$16,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$196,623\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Domestically, cash equivalents primarily consist of AAA rated government money market funds and commercial paper rated A1/P1 or better with maturities less than 91 days from the date of purchase, and treasury discount notes. \nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Commercial Commitments(e)\n</td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit and surety bonds\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 The Other decrease was due primarily to the sale of The Princeton Review. \n \u2022 Publishing - consists of Premium Brands, which includes Dotdash, Dictionary.com, Investopedia and The Daily Beast; and Ask & Other, which primarily includes Ask Media Group, CityGrid and, for periods prior to its sale on June 30, 2016, ASKfm. \nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$105,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(3,815)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$35,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,636\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\n \u2022 The Applications decrease was due primarily to a decline of $37.5 million in online marketing, principally related to lower anticipated search revenue from our downloadable desktop applications at Consumer. \nNon-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded From Non-GAAP Measure\nThe Princeton Review's revenue was primarily earned from fees received directly from students for in-person and online test preparation classes, access to online test preparation materials and individual tutoring services.

The increase in compensation was due to an increase of $9.1 million in stock-based compensation expense due primarily to an increase in expense related to a subsidiary denominated equity award held by a non-employee, which award was settled in the third quarter of 2017, the employer portion of payroll taxes paid in connection with the exercise of Match Group options and an increase in headcount from business growth.

North America and International ARPU\nAt December 31, 2017, IAC had 8.6 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization. IAC may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors IAC management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook.\n \u2022 The ANGI Homeservices increase was due primarily to higher online and offline marketing of $51.2 million and an increase of $27.8 million in compensation due primarily to an increase in the sales force.  General and administrative expense\nThe revenue earned by our Video segment is derived from subscriptions, media production and distribution, and advertising.\nANGI Homeservices\nANGI Homeservices revenue increased 48% driven by growth of $152.5 million, or 36%, at Marketplace (formerly HomeAdvisor Domestic) and 55% at the European business. Marketplace Revenue growth was driven by a 37% increase in Marketplace Service Requests to 18.1 million and a 26% increase in Marketplace Paying SPs to 181,000. Revenue growth at the European business was driven by the acquisitions of controlling interests in MyHammer on November 3, 2016 and MyBuilder on March 24, 2017, as well as by organic growth across other regions. Revenue in 2017 includes a contribution of $58.9 million from Angie's List since the date of the Combination, which reflects a reduction in revenue of $7.8 million due to the write-off of deferred revenue related to the Combination.\nMatch Group Adjusted EBITDA increased 42% due primarily to higher revenue and a decrease in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue as the product mix continued to shift towards brands with lower marketing spend, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue driven by a significant increase in in-app purchase fees. Additionally, there were $11.8 million of lower costs in 2016 related to the consolidation and streamlining of technology systems and European operations ($4.9 million in 2016 compared to $16.8 million in 2015).\nThe Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future. The Company's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. The Company's indebtedness could limit our ability to: (i) obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditure or debt service or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to make acquisitions,\n (a) The Company has excluded $37.2 million in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest from the table above as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities might be paid. For additional information on income taxes, see \"Note 3-Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" \nIAC is a leading media and Internet company composed of widely known consumer brands, such as Match, Tinder, PlentyOfFish and OkCupid, which are part of Match Group's online dating portfolio, HomeAdvisor and Angie's List, which are operated by ANGI Homeservices, as well as Vimeo, Dotdash, Dictionary.com, The Daily Beast and Investopedia.\nOther Developments\ndecreased 5% and 7%, respectively, due primarily to the continued mix shift towards lower ARPU brands, including Tinder and PlentyOfFish, which had lower price points compared to Match Group's more established brands. North America ARPU decline was partially offset by an increase in mix-adjusted rates.\n \u2022 The Applications decrease was due primarily to a reduction of $52.0 million in traffic acquisition costs driven by a decline in revenue at Partnerships. \nANGI Homeservices Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $37.9 million, despite an increase of $237.5 million in revenue, due primarily to an increase in selling and marketing expense, higher compensation expense due, in part, to increase headcount, the inclusion in 2017 of $44.1 million in costs related to the Combination (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) and increases in bad debt expense due, in part, to higher Marketplace Revenue, outsourced customer service expense and software license and maintenance costs. The higher losses at the European businesses were driven primarily by the European expansion strategy, including increased investment in online and offline marketing and higher compensation costs. Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 was further impacted by write-offs of deferred revenue related to the Combination of $7.8 million and the acquisition of HomeStars of $0.7 million.\nThe aggregate goodwill balance for the reporting units for which the most recent estimate of fair value is less than 120% of their carrying values is approximately $450 million.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nIn 2017, the Company's revenue increased $167.4 million, or 5%, operating income increased $221.1 million from a loss of $32.6 million in the prior year and Adjusted EBITDA grew $74.1 million, or 15%. Revenue increased due primarily to an increase of $237.5 million from ANGI Homeservices due, in part, to the Combination, growth of $212.6 million from Match Group and $48.3 million from Video, partially offset by a decline of $259.4 million from Other due to the sales of ShoeBuy, The Princeton Review and PriceRunner on December 30, 2016, March 31, 2017 and March 18, 2016, respectively, and a decline of $45.5 million from Publishing primarily due to the effects of the Google contract. The operating income increase was due primarily to the inclusion in 2016 of a $275.4 million goodwill impairment charge at Publishing, an increase of $74.1 million in Adjusted EBITDA, described below, and a decrease of $37.3 million in amortization of intangibles, partially offset by an increase of $159.8 million in stock-based compensation expense due, in part, to the Combination. The goodwill impairment charge at Publishing in 2016 was driven by the impact from the Google contract, traffic trends and monetization challenges. The Adjusted EBITDA increase was due primarily to growth of $65.6 million from Match Group, a profit from Publishing of $31.5 million in 2017 compared to a loss of $7.6 million in 2016 and growth of $4.5 million from Applications, partially offset by increased losses of $14.5 million from Corporate, $9.2 million from Video and a decline of $8.0 million from ANGI Homeservices due primarily to costs of $44.1 million (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) and deferred revenue write-offs of $7.8 million related to the Combination.\n\nDepreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.\nGoodwill is the Company's largest asset with a carrying value of $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying value of $459.1 million and $320.6 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nquarter, and the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of shareholders' equity. The specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. The Company recognizes unrealized losses on marketable securities in net earnings when the losses are determined to be other-than-temporary. Additionally, the Company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis, and recognizes an impairment loss if the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary. Future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as other-than-temporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the Company's investments to decline.\nOperating income (loss)\n\nIn July 2017, Match Group elected to convert all outstanding equity awards of its wholly-owned subsidiary Tinder, which awards were primarily held by current and former Tinder employees, to stock options of Match Group (the \"Tinder Equity Plan Settlement\"). Subsequently, during 2017, Match Group made cash payments of approximately $520 million to cover both withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees exercising these converted awards, as these awards were net settled, and the purchase of certain fully vested awards.\n\nIAC reports Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. IAC endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.\nThe Transition Tax on deemed repatriated foreign earnings is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits (\"E&P\") of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. To determine the amount of the Transition Tax, the Company must determine, among other factors, the amount of post-1986 E&P of its foreign subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. The Company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the Transition Tax and has recorded a provisional transition tax expense of $62.7 million. Any adjustment of the Company's provisional tax expense will be reflected as a change in estimate in its results in the period in which the change in estimate is made in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company is continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of the Transition Tax and expects to finalize its calculation prior to the filing of its U.S. federal tax return, which is due on October 15, 2018. The additional information includes, but is not limited to, the allocation and sourcing of income and deductions in 2017 for purposes of calculating the utilization of foreign tax credits. In addition, our estimates may also be impacted and adjusted as the law is clarified and additional guidance is issued at the federal and state levels.\nMANAGEMENT OVERVIEW\nOn August 14, 2017, Match Group increased its Term Loan by $75 million to $425 million, repriced the outstanding balance at LIBOR plus 2.50% and reduced the LIBOR floor to 0.00%. Previously, the interest charged on the Match Group Term Loan was LIBOR plus 3.25%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%.\nGoogle contract, traffic trends and monetization challenges. The decrease in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to lower expense in 2017 as a result of a Publishing trade name and certain intangible assets from the PlentyOfFish acquisition now being fully amortized, partially offset by expense in 2017 related to the Combination. Amortization of intangibles was further impacted by the inclusion of an impairment charge in 2016 of $11.6 million related to certain Publishing indefinite-lived trade names. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to an increase of $140.3 million at ANGI Homeservices due primarily to the modification and acceleration charges related to the Combination, as well as an increase in expense related to a subsidiary denominated equity award held by a non-employee, which award was settled during the third quarter of 2017, and the issuance of new equity awards since 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 The Publishing decrease was due primarily to the effect of the reductions in workforce in 2016, $2.3 million in restructuring costs included in 2016 and the sale of ASKfm on June 30, 2016.  For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nNet cash used in investing activities includes acquisitions and purchases of investments of $651.9 million, which includes PlentyOfFish, and capital expenditures of $62.0 million, primarily related to investments in development of capitalized software to support our products and services, and computer hardware, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities (net of purchases) of marketable securities of $125.3 million, and net proceeds from the sale of long-term investments and an asset of $9.4 million.\nOther income, net in 2015 included a gain of $34.3 million from a real estate transaction, $5.4 million in net foreign currency exchange gains due to the strengthening of the dollar relative to the Euro and $4.3 million in interest income, partially offset by $6.7 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain investments and expense of $2.3 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment pertaining to a subsidiary denominated equity award held by a non-employee.\n (b) Represents contractual amounts due including interest on both fixed and variable rate instruments. Long-term debt at December 31, 2017 consists of $1.4 billion, bearing interest at fixed rates and a $425.0 million Match Group Term Loan and a $275.0 million ANGI Homeservices Term Loan bearing interest at variable rates. The Match Group Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50%, or 3.85%, at December 31, 2017. The ANGI Homeservices Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%, or 3.38% at December 31, 2017. The amount of interest ultimately paid on the Match Group and ANGI Homeservices term loans may differ based on changes in interest rates. For additional information on long-term debt arrangements, see \"Note 9-Long-term Debt\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" \nANGI Homeservices revenue is primarily derived from consumer connection revenue, which includes fees paid by service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the professional ultimately provides the requested service) and membership subscription fees paid by service professionals. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon certain factors including the service requested, type of match (such as Instant Booking, Instant Connect, same day service or next day service) and geographic location of service. Effective with the Combination (described below), revenue is also derived from Angie's List sales of time-based advertising to service professionals and membership subscription fees from consumers.\nMatch Group Adjusted EBITDA increased 16% due primarily to an increase of $212.6 million in revenue and lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue due to the ongoing product mix towards brands with lower marketing spend and a reduction in marketing spend at Match Group's affinity brands, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue, general and administrative expense and product development expense. General and administrative expense and product development expense increased due, in part, to expense of $12.7 million associated with the employer portion of payroll taxes and professional fees resulting from the Tinder Equity Plan Settlement.\n \u2022 The Video decrease was due primarily to a reduction of $8.9 million in online marketing driven primarily by Vimeo. \n \u2022 PlentyOfFish on October 28, 2015 (reflected in the Match Group segment); and \n \u2022 The Corporate increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs in 2017, including an increase in stock-based compensation expense due primarily to the issuance of new equity awards since 2016 and higher professional fees. \nCost of revenue in 2017 decreased from 2016 due to decreases of $169.4 million from Other, $31.6 million from Publishing and $20.9 million from Applications, partially offset by increases of $83.9 million from Match Group, $25.9 million from Video and $8.2 million from ANGI Homeservices.\nAs of December 31, 2017, IAC's economic and voting interest in Match Group is 81.2% and 97.6%, respectively, and in ANGI Homeservices is 86.9% and 98.5%, respectively. Certain Match Group and ANGI Homeservices equity awards can be settled either in IAC common shares or the common shares of these subsidiaries at IAC's election. The Company currently expects to settle a sufficient number of awards in IAC shares to maintain an economic interest in both Match Group and ANGI Homeservices of at least 80%.\n \u2022 The Match Group increase was due primarily to an increase of $20.7 million in compensation driven by an increase of $14.4 million related to increased headcount and the employer portion of payroll taxes paid in connection with the exercise of Match Group options, and an increase of $6.3 million in stock-based compensation expense due primarily to new grants issued since 2016. \nWe review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. In addition, the Company reviews the useful lives of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2017 primarily represents the publicly-held interest in Match Group's earnings, partially offset by ANGI Homeservices losses.\n \u2022 4.875% Senior Notes - The outstanding balance of $361.9 million was redeemed on November 30, 2017, using a portion of the proceeds from the Exchangeable Notes. \nKey Terms:\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Act. The Tax Act subjects to U.S. taxation certain previously deferred earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 ( Transition Tax\u201d) and implements a number of changes that take effect on January 1, 2018, including but not limited to, a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and a new minimum tax on intangible income earned by foreign subsidiaries. The Company's income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes an expense of $63.8 million related to the Tax Act, of which, $62.7 million relates to the Transition Tax and $1.1 million relates to the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate. The Company has sufficient current year net operating losses to offset the taxable income resulting from the Transition Tax and, therefore, will not be required to pay the one-time Transition Tax.\nSelling and marketing expense in 2017 increased from 2016 due to increases of $157.3 million from ANGI Homeservices, $26.5 million from Match Group and $17.5 million from Video, partially offset by decreases of $37.6 million from Publishing and $22.3 million from Other.\nOn October 2, 2017, a finance subsidiary of the Company issued $517.5 million aggregate principal amount of Exchangeable Notes due October 1, 2022, which notes are guaranteed by the Company and are exchangeable into shares of the Company's common stock. The proceeds from these notes were, in part, loaned to IAC, which repaid the outstanding balance of its 4.875% Senior Notes of $361.9 million on November 30, 2017. Each $1,000 of principal of the Exchangeable Notes is exchangeable for 6.5713 shares of the Company's common stock, which is equivalent to an exchange price of approximately $152.18 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.\nCash Flow Information\nA meaningful portion of the Company's revenue is attributable to the services agreement with Google described above. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenue earned from Google represents 22%, 26% and 40%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue.\nThe Company evaluates and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. Recognition (step one) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustainable upon examination. Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. De-recognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when the Company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits of $39.7 million and $41.0 million, including interest and penalties, respectively. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Although management currently believes changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.\n \u2022 The Applications decrease was due primarily to a reduction of $16.6 million in traffic acquisition costs driven by a decline in revenue at Partnerships and a decrease of $2.9 million in compensation due, in part, to the reductions in workforce in 2016. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\n \u2022 Average Revenue per Subscriber (or \"ARPU\") - is Direct Revenue from Subscribers in the relevant measurement period (whether in the form of subscription or \u00e0 la carte) divided by the Average Subscribers in such period and further divided by the number of calendar days in such period. Direct Revenue from users who are not Subscribers and have purchased only \u00e0 la carte features is not included in ARPU. \n \u2022 The Other decrease was due primarily to decreases in consulting expenses and non-income tax related items at The Princeton Review. \nFor a detailed description of the Publishing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, see \"Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nBusiness Combinations and Contingent Consideration Arrangements\n (d) At December 31, 2017 and 2016, cash and cash equivalents include Match Group's domestic and international cash and cash equivalents of $203.5 million and $69.2 million; and $114.0 million and $139.6 million, respectively. Match Group is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and board of directors and has no obligation to provide the Company with funds. As a result, we cannot freely access the cash of Match Group and its subsidiaries. Match Group generated $321.1 million and $259.6 million of operating cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, agreements governing Match Group's indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or distributions, loans or advances to stockholders, including the Company, in the event a default has occurred or Match Group's leverage ratio (as defined in the indentures) exceeds 5.0 to 1.0. \nApplications Adjusted EBITDA decreased 28% due primarily to lower revenue, partially offset by decreases in cost of revenue and selling and marketing expense. Adjusted EBITDA was further impacted by $2.6 million in restructuring charges.\n \u2022 The Match Group increase was primarily related to an increase of $7.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, increased headcount at Tinder, and the 2015 acquisitions of PlentyOfFish and Pairs. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to the issuance of new equity awards and a net increase in expense associated with the modification of certain equity awards since 2015. \nRecoverability and Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets\nOther income, net in 2016 includes gains of $37.5 million and $12.0 million related to the sale of ShoeBuy and PriceRunner, respectively, $34.4 million in net foreign currency exchange gains due to strengthening of the dollar relative to the British Pound and Euro, interest income of $5.1 million and a $3.6 million gain related to the sale of marketable equity securities, partially offset by a non-cash charge of $12.1 million related to the write-off of a proportionate share of original issue discount and deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of $440 million of the Match Group Term Loan, $10.7 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain investments, a loss of $3.8 million related to the sale of ASKfm, a $3.6 million loss on the 4.75% and 4.875% Senior Note redemptions and repurchases and an expense of $2.5 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment pertaining to a subsidiary denominated equity award held by a non-employee.\n \u2022 The ANGI Homeservices increase was due primarily to the inclusion of expense of $3.7 million from Angie's List resulting from the Combination, an increase of $2.8 million in credit card processing fees due to higher revenue and an increase of $1.6 million in hosting fees, partially offset by a reduction in traffic acquisition costs of $0.4 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\n \u2022 The ANGI Homeservices increase was due primarily to higher compensation of $10.8 million due, in part, to increased headcount, an increase in bad debt expense due to higher Marketplace Revenue, an increase in software license and maintenance costs and $2.1 million in transaction-related costs in 2016. \nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the balance of deferred tax assets (liabilities), net, is $31.3 million and $(226.3) million, respectively.\nThe Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. Such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition, the rate at which the investee utilizes cash and the investee's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee's existing business model due to changing business and regulatory environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $12.2 million, $10.7 million and $6.7 million, respectively, related to cost and equity method investments.\n \u2022 The Applications decrease was due primarily to the inclusion in 2016 of $12.0 million in expense related to an acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustment and a $2.9 million favorable legal settlement in 2017. \nNM = Not meaningful.\nMatch Group's revenue is primarily derived directly from users in the form of recurring subscription fees, which typically provide unlimited access to a bundle of features for a specific period of time. Revenue is also derived from \u00e0 la carte features, where users pay a fee for a specific action or event, and from online advertisers who pay to reach our large audiences.\nAt December 31, 2017, there was $423.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.5 years.\n \u2022 Subscribers - are users who purchase a subscription to one of Match Group's products. Users who purchase only \u00e0 la carte features are not included in Subscribers. \nFor a detailed description of IAC, Match Group and ANGI Homeservices long-term debt, see \"Note 9-Long-term Debt\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nVideo revenue increased 7% due primarily to growth at Electus, Vimeo and Daily Burn, partially offset by lower revenue from IAC Films as 2015 benefited from the release of the movie While We're Young. Vimeo's ending subscribers were 768,000, an increase of 14%, compared to 2015.\nIn 2017, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $291.1 million, which was due primarily to the effect of adopting the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, on January 1, 2017 and foreign income taxed at lower rates, partially offset by the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) discussed below. Under ASU No. 2016-09, excess tax benefits generated by the exercise, purchase or settlement of stock-based awards of $361.8 million in 2017 are recognized as a reduction to the income tax provision rather than as an increase to additional paid-in capital.\nNet cash provided by investing activities includes net proceeds from the sale of businesses, investments and assets of $172.2 million, which mainly relate to the sale of PriceRunner and ShoeBuy, partially offset by capital expenditures of $78.0 million, primarily related to investments in development of capitalized software at Match Group and ANGI Homeservices to support their products and services, as well as leasehold improvements and computer hardware, purchases (net of sales and maturities) of marketable debt securities of $61.6 million, and cash used in acquisitions and purchases of investments of $31.0 million.\n (c) At December 31, 2017, marketable securities consist of commercial paper rated A1+/P1 with an initial maturity of more than 91 days. At December 31, 2016, marketable securities consist of commercial paper rated A1/P1, treasury discount notes, and short-to-medium-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers. The Company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed. The Company also may invest in equity securities as part of its investment strategy. \nOther events affecting year-over-year comparability that occurred prior to 2017 include:\nSources of Revenue\nAmortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions (including the Combination). At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as contractor and service professional relationships, technology, customer lists and user base, content, trade names and membership, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.\nNet cash used in financing activities includes principal payments made on Match Group and IAC debt of $445.2 million and $393.5 million, respectively, the payment of $272.5 million for the purchase of certain fully vested stock-based awards, the payment of $254.2 million, $93.8 million and $10.1 million for withholding taxes paid on behalf of Match Group, IAC and ANGI Homeservices employees, respectively, on net settled stock-based awards, $74.4 million for the Exchangeable Notes hedge, $56.4 million for the repurchase of 0.8 million shares of IAC common stock at an average price of $69.24 per share, $33.7 million of debt issuance costs primarily related to the Exchangeable Notes and the 5.00% Match Group Senior Notes, $27.3 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration payments (included in operating activities is $11.1 million for an acquisition-related contingent consideration payment made in excess of the amount initially recognized at the time of acquisition) and $15.4 million for the purchase of noncontrolling interests, partially offset by $525.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of Match Group debt, $517.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes, $275.0 million in proceeds from the ANGI Homeservices Term Loan, $82.4 million and $59.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of IAC and Match Group common stock, respectively, pursuant to stock-based awards, $23.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of warrants, a $20.1 million decrease in restricted cash that relates to settled IAC bond redemptions and $10.6 million of funds returned from escrow for the MyHammer tender offer.\n \u2022 The Publishing decrease was due primarily to lower compensation and other employee-related costs of $3.8 million due, in part, to reductions in workforce in 2016 including $1.2 million in restructuring costs in 2016 and the sale of ASKfm. \n \u2022 The Applications decrease was due primarily to a decrease of $3.6 million in compensation due, in part, to a decrease in headcount related to reductions in workforce in 2016.  For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nNet cash provided by operating activities consists of earnings adjusted for non-cash items, the effect of changes in working capital and acquisition-related contingent consideration payments (to the extent greater than the liability initially recognized at the time of acquisition). Non-cash adjustments include stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, goodwill impairments, deferred income taxes, acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, gains from the sale of businesses and investments and a real estate transaction, impairments of long-term investments and bad debt expense.\n \u2022 The Other decrease was due to the sales of ShoeBuy and The Princeton Review. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nGeneral and administrative expense in 2017 increased from 2016 due to increases of $192.9 million from ANGI Homeservices, $44.8 million from Match Group and $20.0 million from Corporate, partially offset by decreases of $58.5 million from Other, $10.2 million from Applications and $9.0 million from Publishing.\nVideo revenue increased 21% driven by the sales of The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) and The Legacy of a Whitetail Deer Hunter and the release of Lady Bird at IAC Films and strong growth at Vimeo, which had ending subscribers of 873,000, an increase of 14% year-over-year, partially offset by a decline at Electus.\n \u2022 Match Group 6.75% Senior Notes - Match Group's 6.75% Senior Notes due December 15, 2022, with interest payable each June 15 and December 15. Match Group's 6.75% Senior Notes were issued in exchange for the 4.75% Senior Notes on November 16, 2015. The outstanding balance of $445.2 million was redeemed on December 17, 2017 with the proceeds from the Match Group 5.00% Senior Notes (described below) and cash on hand. \n________________________\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements. We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments, and this measure is one of the primary metrics by which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses.\n \u2022 The Publishing increase was due primarily to $1.2 million in restructuring charges related to severance costs in connection with a reduction in workforce. \nHomeAdvisor acquired controlling interests in MyBuilder Limited (\"MyBuilder\") on March 24, 2017, and HomeStars Inc. (\"HomeStars\") on February 8, 2017, leading home services platforms in the United Kingdom and Canada, respectively.\nOther Adjusted EBITDA decreased 62% due to the sale of PriceRunner in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by profits from The Princeton Review in 2016 and improved Adjusted EBITDA at ShoeBuy resulting from increased revenue.\n (b) Internationally, cash equivalents primarily consist of AAA rated government money market funds and time deposits with maturities of less than 91 days. Approximately $420 million of the Company's international cash can be repatriated without any significant tax consequences as it has been substantially subjected to U.S. income taxes due to the Transition Tax imposed by the Tax Act. If needed for our U.S. operations, the remaining cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries could be repatriated, however, under current law, would be subject to foreign, federal and state income taxes of approximately $8 million. We have not provided for any such tax because the Company currently does not anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to finance our U.S. operations and it is the Company's intent to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. \n \u2022 Applications - consists of Consumer, which includes our direct-to-consumer downloadable desktop applications, Apalon, which houses our mobile operations, and SlimWare, which houses our downloadable desktop software and service operations; and Partnerships, which includes our business-to-business partnership operations. \nPublishing Adjusted EBITDA improved to a profit of $31.5 million in 2017 from a loss of $7.6 million in 2016, despite lower revenue, due primarily to lower operating costs resulting from restructurings in 2016 and the sale of ASKfm. Results in 2016 included $15.6 million in restructuring charges related to vacating a data center and severance costs in an effort to reduce costs in light of significant declines in revenue from the new Google contract.\n \u2022 Acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments - relate to the portion of the purchase price of certain acquisitions that is contingent upon the future operating performance of the acquired company. The amounts ultimately paid are generally dependent upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics as stipulated in the relevant purchase agreements. The fair value of the liability is estimated at the date of acquisition and adjusted each reporting period until the liability is settled. If the payment date of the liability is longer than one year, the amount is initially recorded net of a discount, which is amortized as an expense each period. In a period where the acquired company is expected to perform better than the previous estimate, the liability will be increased resulting in additional expense; and in a period when the acquired company is expected to perform worse than the previous estimate, the liability will be decreased resulting in income. The year-over-year impact can be significant, for example, if there is income in one period and expense in the other period. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $264.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, $74.3 million of depreciation, $42.1 million of amortization of intangibles, $28.9 million of bad debt expense, $12.2 million of impairments on long-term investments, and $43.6 million of other adjustments, which primarily consist of losses on bond redemptions and net foreign currency exchange losses, partially offset by $285.3 million of deferred income taxes and $32.7 million of net gains from the sale of businesses and investments. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to the net operating loss created primarily by excess tax benefits of $361.8 million related to stock-based awards and the modification charge for the conversion and acceleration of stock-based awards in connection with the Combination, partially offset by the provisional Transition Tax. The decrease from changes in working capital consists primarily of an increase in accounts receivable of $115.2 million and a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities of $14.1 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $39.2 million. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to (i) the timing of cash receipts and revenue increasingly sourced through mobile app stores at Match Group, which are settled more slowly than traditional credit cards; and (ii) revenue growth at ANGI Homeservices. The decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities is due to: (i) a decrease at Match Group due to the cash settlement of former subsidiary denominated equity awards held by a non-employee, (ii) a decrease in accrued employee compensation mainly related to the timing of payments of cash bonuses, partially offset by (iii) an increase\nThe 2017 annual assessment did not identify any impairments. While the 2016 annual assessment did not identify any material impairments, during the second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded impairment charges equal to the entire $275.4 million balance of the Publishing reporting unit goodwill and $11.6 million related to certain Publishing indefinite-lived intangible assets. The 2015 annual assessment identified impairment charges related to certain intangible assets of the Publishing reporting unit and the goodwill on the ShoeBuy reporting unit of $88.0 million and $14.1 million, respectively.\nStock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions (including the Combination), of stock options, restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), performance-based RSUs and market-based awards. These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method; however, performance-based RSUs and market-based awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market condition(s) have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period). Upon the exercise of stock options and market-based stock options, the awards are gross settled, and the vesting of RSUs, performance-based RSUs and market-based awards RSUs, the awards are settled, on a net basis, with the Company remitting the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nOn December 4, 2017, Match Group completed a private offering of $450 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.00% Senior Notes due December 15, 2027. The proceeds from these notes, along with cash on hand, were used to redeem the outstanding balance of the Match Group 6.75% Senior Notes of $445.2 million on December 17, 2017.\nThe Company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations. The Company's 2018 capital expenditures are expected to be higher than 2017 by approximately 20% to 25%, driven, in part, by higher capital expenditures for ANGI Homeservices and Match Group related to the\nFinancial Position\nin accrued advertising at Match Group. The increase in deferred revenue is due mainly to growth in subscription sales at Match Group and Vimeo, as well as growth in subscription sales and time-based advertising to service professionals at ANGI Homeservices, partially offset by decreases at Electus and Notional mainly due to the delivery of programming related to various production deals.\n \u2022 North America - consists of the financial results and metrics associated with users located in the United States and Canada. \n \u2022 Match Group's October 1, 2017 market capitalization of $6.3 billion exceeded its carrying value by more than 1100% and Match Group's strong operating performance. \n \u2022 The Video increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation at Vimeo due, in part, to increased headcount. \n \u2022 Match Group Term Loan - a seven-year term loan entered into by Match Group on November 16, 2015 in the original amount of $800 million. During 2016, Match Group made $450 million of principal payments, $400 million of which was funded from proceeds of the 6.375% Senior Notes (described below). On August 14, 2017, the Match Group Term Loan was increased by $75 million to $425 million, repriced the outstanding balance at LIBOR plus 2.50% and reduced the LIBOR floor to 0.00%. The outstanding balance of the Match Group Term Loan as of December 31, 2017 is $425 million. The interest rate on the Match Group Term Loan at December 31, 2017 is 3.85%. \nThe annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.\nIncome Taxes\n \u2022 MyHammer Holding AG (\"MyHammer\") on November 3, 2016 (reflected in the ANGI Homeservices segment) \nNoncontrolling interests represent the noncontrolling holders' percentage share of earnings or losses from the subsidiaries in which the Company holds a majority, but less than 100%, ownership interest and the results of which are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $140.0 million of amortization of intangibles, $105.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, $62.2 million of depreciation, $16.6 million of bad debt expense and $14.1 million of goodwill impairment, partially offset by $59.8 million of deferred income taxes, $34.3 million of gain on a real estate transaction, and $15.5 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. The increase from changes in working capital consists primarily of an increase in deferred revenue of $66.9 million and an increase in income taxes payable and receivable of $24.2 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $29.7 million and an increase in other assets of $21.2 million. The increase in deferred revenue was due mainly to growth in subscription sales at Match Group, Vimeo and ANGI Homeservices, increases related to acquisitions, and increases at Electus, CollegeHumor and Notional mainly due to the timing of various production deals. The increase in income taxes payable and receivable was due to 2015 income tax accruals in excess of 2015 income tax payments. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to growth in Match Group's in-app purchases sold through their mobile products and revenue growth at ANGI Homeservices. The increase in other assets was primarily due to Match Group, relating to an increase in prepaid expenses, primarily from growth and the signing of longer-term contracts, as well as an increase in VAT refund receivables in the Publishing segment.\n \u2022 The Publishing decrease was due primarily to a reduction of $132.6 million in online marketing, resulting from a decline in revenue, partially offset by $3.1 million in restructuring charges in 2016 related to severance costs in connection with a reduction in workforce. \n (e) Commercial commitments are funding commitments that could potentially require registrant performance in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nSelling and marketing expense in 2016 decreased from 2015 due to decreases of $130.2 million from Publishing, $40.1 million from Applications and $11.1 million from Video, partially offset by an increase of $80.8 million from ANGI Homeservices.\n \u2022 Product development expense - consists primarily of compensation (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs that are not capitalized for personnel engaged in the design, development, testing and enhancement of product offerings and related technology. \n2017 Consolidated Results\nIn connection with the Combination, previously issued stock appreciation rights that related to common stock of HomeAdvisor (US) were converted into stock appreciation rights that are settleable in Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices. IAC has the right to settle these awards using shares of IAC common stock. Assuming all vested and unvested stock appreciation rights outstanding on December 31, 2017 were exercised on a net basis on that date and settled using IAC stock, 1.4 million IAC common shares would have been issued in settlement. ANGI Homeservices would have remitted $171.3 million in cash in withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate) on behalf of the employees and issued 16.4 million of its common shares to IAC as reimbursement.\n \u2022 The Publishing decrease was due primarily to reductions of $15.2 million in traffic acquisition costs driven by a decline in revenue at Ask & Other, $8.4 million in rent expense due to vacating a data center in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $6.5 million in content costs due primarily to Dotdash due, in part, to its vertical brand strategy which launched in the second quarter of 2016. \nFor a reconciliation of operating income (loss) by reportable segment and net (loss) earnings attributable to IAC shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 see \"Note 14-Segment Information\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nOn November 1, 2017, ANGI Homeservices borrowed $275 million under a five-year term loan facility.\n \u2022 Marketplace (formerly HomeAdvisor Domestic) Paying Service Professionals (or \"Marketplace Paying SPs\") - are the number of HomeAdvisor domestic service professionals that had an active membership and/or paid for consumer matches in the last month of the period.  Video\n \u2022 The Match Group increase was due primarily to a significant increase in in-app purchase fees across multiple brands, including Tinder, and the 2015 acquisitions of PlentyOfFish and Pairs. \nReportable Segments:\nGains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business.\n \u2022 Match Group 6.375% Senior Notes - Match Group's 6.375% Senior Notes due June 1, 2024, with interest payable each June 1 and December 1. The outstanding balance of the Match Group 6.375% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2017 is $400 million. \n \u2022 The Match Group increase was due primarily to higher offline and online marketing of $15.3 million and an increase in compensation of $9.1 million. The increase in marketing is due primarily to an increase in strategic investments in certain international markets at the Tinder business and increased marketing related to the launch of a new brand in Europe, partially offset by a reduction in marketing spend at Match Group's affinity brands. The increase in compensation is primarily related to an increase in headcount at Tinder and the employer portion of payroll taxes paid in connection with the exercise of Match Group options. As a percentage of revenue, selling and marketing expense decreased due primarily to a continued shift towards brands with lower marketing spend and reductions in marketing spend at the affinity brands. \nMatch Group revenue increased 19% driven by International Direct Revenue growth of $146.3 million, or 38%, and North America Direct Revenue growth of $67.6 million, or 10%. Both International and North America Direct Revenue growth were driven by higher Average Subscribers, up 33% and 9%, respectively, due primarily to continued growth in Subscribers at Tinder. Total ARPU increased 1%.\nOther (expense) income, net\n\nProduct development expense in 2017 increased from 2016 due to increases of $27.3 million from ANGI Homeservices, $23.0 million from Match Group and $5.2 million from Video, partially offset by decreases of $6.3 million from Publishing, $4.6 million from Other and $4.4 million from Applications.\nA substantial portion of the revenue from our Applications and Publishing segments is derived from online advertising, most of which is attributable to our services agreement with Google Inc. (\"Google\"). The Company's services agreement became effective on April 1, 2016, following the expiration of the previous services agreement. The services agreement expires on March 31, 2020; however, the Company may choose to terminate the agreement effective March 31, 2019. The services agreement requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google, and Google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice. Any such updates could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenue earned from Google was $740.7 million, $824.4 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenue earned from Google represents 83%, 87% and 94% of Applications revenue and 71%, 73% and 83% of Publishing revenue, respectively.\n \u2022 The Video increase was due primarily to increases in both online and offline marketing at Vimeo and IAC Films of $10.6 million and $6.5 million, respectively, and compensation at Vimeo and Electus of $2.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of $3.5 million in offline marketing at Daily Burn. \nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\n \u2022 The Video increase was due primarily to the acquisition of Livestream. \nApplications revenue decreased 4% due to a decrease of $37.8 million, or 27%, in Partnerships, partially offset by an increase of $11.7 million, or 3%, in Consumer. Partnerships revenue continued to decline due primarily to the loss of certain partners. The growth in Consumer was due primarily to growth of 37% at Apalon, driven by higher advertising and subscription revenue, and growth at SlimWare, driven by higher subscription revenue, partially offset by lower revenue per query at the Consumer desktop applications business. Apalon and SlimWare together comprised 16% of total Applications revenue in 2017.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \u2022 Cost of revenue - consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs and includes (i) fees paid to Apple and Google related to the distribution and the facilitation of in-app purchases of product features and (ii) payments made to partners who distribute our Partnerships customized browser-based applications and who integrate our paid listings into their websites. These payments include amounts based on revenue share and other arrangements. Cost of revenue also includes production costs related to media produced by Electus and other businesses within our Video segment, hosting fees, compensation (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in data center operations and Match Group customer service functions, credit card processing fees, content costs, and expenses associated with the operation of the Company's data centers. For periods prior to the sale of The Princeton Review and ShoeBuy, cost of revenue also includes rent and cost for teachers and tutors and cost of products sold, including shipping and handling costs, respectively. \nAcquisitions are an important part of the Company's growth strategy. The Company invested $912.1 million (including the value of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock issued in connection with the Combination), $36.1 million and $650.7 million in acquisitions in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. The fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. The excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.\nDefinition of Non-GAAP Measure\nOn October 18, 2017, Vimeo acquired Livestream, a leading live video solution that powers millions of events a year.\nRecoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2016 primarily represented the proportionate share of the noncontrolling holders' ownership in Match Group.\nNo income taxes have been provided on indefinitely reinvested cash earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of $101.2 million at December 31, 2017. The estimated amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to such cash earnings would be $7.9 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities includes $450.0 million in principal payments on Match Group debt, $308.9 million for the repurchase of 6.2 million shares of IAC common stock at an average price of $49.74 per share, $126.4 million in principal payments on IAC debt and $29.8 million and $26.7 million for the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of Match Group and IAC employees, respectively, on net settled stock-based awards, partially offset by $400.0 million in\n \u2022 The Publishing decrease was due primarily to the sale of ASKfm and a decrease in bad debt expense, partially offset by $2.3 million in restructuring charges in 2016 primarily related to severance costs in connection with a reduction in workforce. \n \u2022 Marketplace (formerly HomeAdvisor Domestic) Service Requests - are fully completed and submitted domestic customer service requests on HomeAdvisor. \nThe ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.\n \u2022 The Other increase was due primarily to an increase in cost of products sold at ShoeBuy due to increased sales, partially offset by a mix shift to higher margin online products from in-person courses at The Princeton Review and the sale of PriceRunner. \nMarketable Securities and Long-term Investments\nquantitatively tested the Daily Burn and Electus reporting units. The Company's quantitative test indicated that the fair value of each of these reporting units is in excess of its respective carrying value; therefore, the goodwill of these reporting units is not impaired. The Company's Publishing reporting unit has no goodwill.\n \u2022 The Company performed valuations of the Vimeo and Applications reporting units during 2017. These valuations were prepared primarily in connection with the issuance and/or settlement of equity grants that are denominated in the equity of these businesses. The valuations were prepared time proximate to, however, not as of, October 1, 2017. The fair value of each of these businesses was in excess of its October 1, 2017 carrying value.  The Company foregoes a qualitative assessment and tests the goodwill for impairment when it concludes that it is more likely than not that there may be an impairment. For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2017, the Company\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING\n (c) The Company leases land, office space, data center facilities and equipment used in connection with operations under various operating leases, many of which contain escalation clauses. The Company is also committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under a data center lease agreement. These operating expenses are not included in the table above. For additional information on operating leases, see \"Note 15-Commitments and Contingencies\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" \nOther than the items described above, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2017.\n\nAt December 31, 2017, marketable securities of $5.0 million consist of commercial paper rated A1+/P1. Long-term investments at December 31, 2017 of $65.0 million include equity securities accounted for under the cost and equity methods.\nThe Company has granted stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights denominated in the equity of certain non-publicly traded subsidiaries to employees and management of those subsidiaries. These equity awards vest over a period of years or upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events. The value of the stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights is tied to the value of the common stock of these subsidiaries. Accordingly, these interests only have value to the extent the relevant business appreciates in value above the initial value utilized to determine the exercise price. These interests can have significant value in the event of significant appreciation. The interests are ultimately settled in IAC common stock with fair market value generally determined by negotiation or arbitration. These equity awards are settled on a net basis, with the award holder entitled to receive a payment in IAC shares equal to the intrinsic value of the award at exercise less an amount equal to the required cash tax withholding payment. The number of shares ultimately needed to settle these awards may vary significantly as a result of both movements in our stock price and a determination of fair value of the relevant subsidiary that is different than our estimate. The number of IAC common shares that would be required to settle these interests, other than for Match Group and ANGI Homeservices subsidiaries, at current estimated fair values, including vested and unvested interests, at December 31, 2017 is 0.1 million shares. Withholding taxes, which will be paid by the Company on behalf of the employees upon exercise, would have been $15.2 million at December 31, 2017, assuming a 50% withholding rate.\n \u2022 The Match Group increase was due primarily to increases of $75.4 million in in-app purchase fees and $5.9 million in hosting fees. The increases were due primarily to the growth at Tinder. \nOperating income in 2017 increased from a loss in 2016 due primarily to the inclusion in 2016 of a $275.4 million goodwill impairment charge at Publishing, an increase of $74.1 million in Adjusted EBITDA described below, and a decrease of $37.3 million in amortization of intangibles, partially offset by an increase of $159.8 million in stock-based compensation expense, a change of $3.2 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments and an increase of $2.6 million in depreciation expense. The goodwill impairment charge at Publishing in 2016 was driven by the impact from the\ndevelopment of capitalized software to support our products and services and for ANGI Homeservices' new corporate headquarters, partially offset by lower capital expenditures at Corporate.\nIn May 2017, the Board of Directors of Match Group authorized Match Group to repurchase up to 6 million shares of its common stock. Match Group has not repurchased any shares related to this repurchase authorization.\nANGI Homeservices revenue increased 38% due primarily to 44% growth at Marketplace and 18% growth at the European business. Marketplace Revenue growth was driven by a 34% increase in Marketplace Service Requests to 13.2 million and a 41% increase in Marketplace Paying SPs to 143,000. Revenue growth at the European business was driven by organic growth across all regions as well as the acquisition of a controlling interest in MyHammer.\nOn October 23, 2017, Match Group sold a cost method investment for net proceeds of $60.2 million. The gain on sale of $9.1 million is included in \"Other (expense) income, net\" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nStrategic Partnerships, Advertiser Relationships and Online Advertising\nWhen the following terms appear in this report, they have the meanings indicated below:\nGeneral and administrative expense in 2016 increased from 2015 due to increases of $22.1 million from ANGI Homeservices, $12.6 million from Match Group and $10.5 million from Applications, partially offset by decreases of $14.1 million from Publishing, $10.9 million from Other and $3.0 million from Corporate.\n \u2022 ANGI Homeservices Term Loan - a five-year term loan entered into by ANGI Homeservices on November 1, 2017 in the amount of $275 million. The ANGI Homeservices Term Loan currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%. The outstanding balance of the ANGI Homeservices Term Loan as of December 31, 2017 is $275 million. The interest rate on the ANGI Homeservices Term Loan at December 31, 2017 is 3.38%.  See \"Note 9-Long-term Debt\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further information.\nNon-GAAP financial measure:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nCost of revenue in 2016 decreased from 2015 due to decreases of $54.7 million from Applications and $47.0 million from Publishing, partially offset by increases of $61.3 million from Match Group, $7.7 million from Video, $7.1 million from Other and $2.9 million from ANGI Homeservices.\nThe Company will not be required to pay the one-time Transition Tax under the Tax Act because of its net operating loss position. The Company does not expect to be a full U.S. federal cash income tax payer until 2021, which is in line with previous estimates. We expect the Tax Act to favorably impact our future liquidity, primarily as a result of a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which will lower our effective tax rate and annual tax liability.\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $275.4 million of goodwill impairment at the Publishing segment, $104.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, $79.4 million of amortization of intangibles, $71.7 million of depreciation, $17.7 million of bad debt expense, and $10.7 million of impairments on long-term investments, partially offset by $119.2 million of deferred income taxes and $51.0 million of net gains from the sale of businesses and investments. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to the Publishing goodwill impairment. The decrease from changes in working capital consists primarily of a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities of $52.4 million, an increase in other assets of $12.9 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $35.8 million and an increase in income taxes payable and receivable of $9.0 million. The decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities is due to (i) a decrease in accrued advertising and revenue share expense at Publishing and Applications mainly due to the effect of the new Google contract, which became effective April 1, 2016, (ii) a decrease in VAT payables related mainly to decreases in international revenue at Publishing, and (iii) decreases in payables at Match Group due to the timing of payments. The increase in other assets is primarily related to an increase in production costs at IAC Films. The increase in deferred revenue is mainly due to growth in subscription sales at Match Group, ANGI Homeservices and Vimeo. The increase in income taxes payable and receivable is primarily due to receipt of 2015 capital loss refund in 2016 and 2016 income tax accruals in excess of 2016 income tax payments, partially offset by payment of 2015 tax liabilities in 2016.\n \u2022 The ANGI Homeservices increase was due primarily to higher online and offline marketing of $78.2 million, of which $5.3 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, an increase of $64.9 million in compensation, of which $24.4 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, and $9.5 million of expense from acquisitions made prior to the Combination. The increase in marketing is due primarily to increased organic investment including television spend. Compensation increased due primarily to an increase of $24.9 million in stock-based compensation expense, of which $9.8 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, an increase in the sales force and the inclusion of $7.4 million in severance and retention costs related to the Combination. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due \nCost of revenue\nIn summary, the Company's cash flows are as follows: \nVideo Adjusted EBITDA loss improved 45% due primarily to reduced losses at Vimeo and Daily Burn and increased profits at Electus.\n \u2022 The Video increase was due primarily to a net increase in production costs at our media and video businesses and an increase in hosting fees related to Vimeo's subscription growth, increased video plays and expanded On Demand catalog. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in investment in content costs at Vimeo in 2016. \n \u2022 The Applications decrease was due primarily to a decrease of $4.4 million in compensation due, in part, to a decrease in headcount related to a reduction in workforce that took place in the first half of 2016.  Depreciation\n________________________\nIn July 2017, Tinder, Inc. ( Tinder\u201d) was merged into Match Group and as a result, all Tinder denominated equity awards were converted into Match Group tandem stock options (\"Tandem Awards\"). All of the Tandem Awards exercised during 2017 were exercised on a net basis and settled in IAC common shares. Assuming all vested and unvested Match Group Tandem Awards outstanding on December 31, 2017 were exercised on a net basis on that date and settled using IAC stock, 0.8 million IAC common shares would have been issued in settlement. Match Group would have remitted $102.4 million in cash in withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate) on behalf of the employees and issued 3.3 million of its common shares to IAC as reimbursement.\nOther expense, net in 2017 includes $16.8 million in net foreign currency exchange losses due primarily to the weakening of the dollar relative to the British Pound, expense of $15.4 million related to the extinguishment of the Match Group 6.75% Senior Notes and repricing of the Match Group Term Loan, expense of $13.0 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment pertaining to a subsidiary denominated equity award held by a non-employee, $12.2 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain investments and expense of $1.2 million related to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the 4.875% Senior Notes, partially offset by $34.9 million in gains related to the sales of certain investments and interest income of $11.4 million.\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2015 primarily represented the proportionate share of the noncontrolling holders' ownership in certain subsidiaries within the Video, ANGI Homeservices and Publishing segments and Match Group.\nThe fair value of the Company's reporting units is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows (\"DCF\") and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of October 1 each year. The Company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its subsidiary denominated stock based compensation plans, which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative screen. Determining fair value using a DCF analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed based on the reporting units' current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rates used in determining the fair value of the Company's reporting units ranged from 12.5% to 17.5% in 2017 and 10% to 17.5% in 2016. Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors. While a primary driver in the determination of the fair values of the Company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability, the determination of fair value is based, in part, upon the Company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.\n \u2022 Pairs (also known as Eureka) on April 24, 2015 (reflected in the Match Group segment). \n (ii) acquisitions in 2016 and 2015: \nWhile the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying values, the Company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 1. In 2017, the Company did not quantitatively assess the Angie's List indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired through the Combination given the proximity of the September 29, 2017 transaction date to the October 1, 2017 annual test date. The Company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks. Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 11% to 16% in both 2017 and 2016, and the royalty rates used ranged from 2% to 7% in both 2017 and 2016.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nIn connection with certain business combinations, the Company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price. Each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled. The contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics. The Company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, are recognized in General and administrative expense\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nOperating income in 2016 decreased to a loss from 2015 despite an increase of $15.4 million in Adjusted EBITDA described below, due primarily to increases of $261.3 million in goodwill impairment charges, $9.5 million in depreciation and a change of $18.0 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, partially offset by a decrease of $60.5 million in amortization of intangibles. The increase in goodwill impairment charges was due to the write-off of goodwill of $275.4 million at Publishing in 2016 compared to the write-off of goodwill of $14.1 million at ShoeBuy in 2015. The goodwill impairment charge at Publishing was driven by the impact from the new Google contract, which was effective April 1, 2016, traffic trends and monetization challenges and the corresponding impact on the then estimated fair value. The Publishing goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the second quarter of 2016. The change in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments was primarily the result of expense in 2016 of $2.6 million versus income of $15.5 million in 2015. The decrease in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to a reduction in impairment charges during 2016, partially offset by $23.3 million in amortization related to a change in classification of a Publishing trade name from an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a definite-lived intangible asset, effective April 1, 2016. The Company recorded an impairment charge in 2016 of $11.6 million compared to an impairment charge in 2015 of $88.0 million all related to certain Publishing indefinite-lived trade names.\nRevenue\nproceeds from the issuance of Match Group debt and $39.4 million and $25.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of Match Group and IAC common stock, respectively, pursuant to stock-based awards.\nFor a reconciliation of operating income (loss) for the Company's reportable segments and net (loss) earnings attributable to IAC's shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA, see \"Note 14-Segment Information\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nNet cash provided by investing activities includes net proceeds from sale of businesses and investments of $185.8 million, which is primarily related to the sale of The Princeton Review and a Match Group cost method investment, and proceeds (net of purchases) of marketable debt securities of $84.5 million, partially offset by acquisitions and purchases of investments of $158.2 million, which includes Livestream, MyBuilder, Angie's List and HomeStars acquisitions, and capital expenditures of $75.5 million, primarily related to investments in development of capitalized software at Match Group and ANGI Homeservices to support their products and services, computer hardware and the Company's purchase of a 50% ownership interest in an aircraft as a replacement for an existing 50% interest in a previously owned aircraft, which was sold on February 13, 2018.\n \u2022 ANGI Homeservices' October 1, 2017 market capitalization of $5.9 billion exceeded its carrying value by more than 450% and ANGI Homeservices' strong operating performance. \n \u2022 The Video increase was due primarily to an increase in production costs at IAC Films related to the sales of The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) and The Legacy of a Whitetail Deer Hunter and the release of Lady Bird in the current year period, the contribution from Livestream, which was acquired on October 18, 2017, and an increase of $2.6 million in hosting fees at Vimeo due to subscription growth, partially offset by lower production costs at Electus. \nIncome tax benefit (provision)\n \u2022 Exchangeable Notes - On October 2, 2017, a finance subsidiary of the Company issued $517.5 million aggregate principal of 0.875% Exchangeable Senior Notes due October 1, 2022, which notes are guaranteed by the Company and are exchangeable into shares of the Company's common stock. A portion of the proceeds were used to repay the outstanding balance of the 4.875% Senior Notes (described below). Interest is payable each April 1 and October 1, which commences on April 1, 2018. The outstanding balance of the Exchangeable Notes as of December 31, 2017 is $517.5 million. Each $1,000 of principal of the Exchangeable Notes is exchangeable for 6.5713 shares of the Company's common stock, which is equivalent to an exchange price of approximately $152.18 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. \nIn 2015, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $29.5 million, which represented an effective income tax rate of 21%. The effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the realization of certain deferred tax assets, foreign income taxed at lower rates, the non-taxable gain on contingent consideration fair value adjustments, and a reduction in tax reserves and related interest due to the expiration of statutes of limitations, partially offset by a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and unbenefited losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries.\n \u2022 4.75% Senior Notes - IAC's 4.75% Senior Notes due December 15, 2022, with interest payable each June 15 and December 15, a portion of which were exchanged for the Match Group 6.75% Senior Notes (described below) on November 16, 2015. The outstanding balance of the 4.75% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2017 is $34.9 million. \n (iii) costs of $4.9 million and $16.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the consolidation and streamlining of technology systems and European operations at the Match Group segment. This project was complete as of December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 Selling and marketing expense - consists primarily of advertising expenditures, which include online marketing, including fees paid to search engines, social media sites and third parties that distribute our Consumer downloadable desktop applications, offline marketing, which is primarily television advertising, and partner-related payments to those who direct traffic to the Match Group and ANGI Homeservices brands, and compensation (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in selling and marketing and sales support. \n \u2022 The Publishing decrease was due primarily to a reduction of $26.6 million in online marketing, principally related to lower Ask & Other revenue resulting from changes in the Google contract, and a decrease of $8.0 million in compensation due, in part, to reductions in workforce that occurred in 2016 including $3.1 million in restructuring costs in 2016. \n \u2022 Average Subscribers - is the number of Subscribers at the end of each day in the relevant measurement period divided by the number of calendar days in that period. \nInterest expense\n \u2022 Match Group - is the world's leading provider of dating products, operating a portfolio of brands, including Tinder, Match, PlentyOfFish and OkCupid. \nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. In performing its annual assessment, the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.\n \u2022 International - consists of the financial results and metrics associated with users located outside of the United States and Canada. \n \u2022 The ANGI Homeservices increase was due primarily to higher compensation of $130.7 million, of which $38.4 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, and $24.3 million in costs related to the Combination including transaction related costs of $14.3 million and integration related costs of $10.0 million. The increase in compensation was due primarily to an increase of $100.5 million in stock-based compensation expense, of which $18.0 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, an increase in headcount from business growth and the inclusion of $11.8 million in severance and retention costs in 2017 related to the Combination. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due principally to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor vested and unvested equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards, the expense related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards and the acceleration of certain Angie's List equity awards resulting from the termination of employees in connection with the Combination as well as a modification charge related to a HomeAdvisor equity award in 2017. General and administrative expense also includes increases of $9.2 million in bad debt expense due, in part, to higher Marketplace Revenue, $3.9 million in outsourced customer service expense and $3.2 million in software license and maintenance costs, as well as $9.8 million of expense from acquisitions made prior to the Combination. \nOn September 29, 2017, the Company's HomeAdvisor segment and Angie's List, Inc. (\"Angie's List\") combined under a new publicly traded company called ANGI Homeservices Inc. (the \"Combination\"). At December 31, 2017, IAC owned 86.9% and 98.5% of the economic and voting interest, respectively, of ANGI Homeservices. See \"Note 4-Business Combination\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information related to the Combination. In connection with the Combination, the Company changed the name of its HomeAdvisor segment to ANGI Homeservices and year-over-year comparisons for financial results for this segment are to the historical results of the HomeAdvisor segment (adjusted to reflect corporate allocations from IAC). During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $44.1 million in costs related to this transaction (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) as well as deferred revenue write-offs of $7.8 million. The Company expects the remaining aggregate amount of transaction-related expenses, including deferred revenue write-offs, during 2018 to be in the range of $10 million to $20 million. The Company also incurred $122.1 million in stock-based compensation expense during 2017 related to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor vested and unvested equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards, the expense related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards and the acceleration of certain Angie's List equity awards resulting from the termination of employees in connection with the Combination. Stock-based compensation expense arising from the Combination is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2018.\n\n \u2022 Match Group 5.00% Senior Notes - Match Group's 5.00% Senior Notes due December 15, 2027, with interest payable each June 15 and December 15, which commences on June 15, 2018.

Ask & Other revenue decreased due to a decline in revenue at Ask Media Group primarily as a result of the new Google contract, which became effective April 1, 2016, as well as declines from certain other legacy businesses. Premium Brands revenue decreased due primarily to declines in monetization, mainly attributable to the new Google contract and organic traffic at Dotdash, partially offset by strong growth at Investopedia and The Daily Beast.\nIn 2016, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $64.9 million, which represented an effective income tax rate of 80%. The effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to foreign income taxed at lower rates and the non-taxable gain on the sale of ShoeBuy, partially offset by the non-deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge at the Publishing segment.\n \u2022 The ANGI Homeservices increase was due primarily to an increase of $23.0 million in compensation, of which $6.8 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, and $2.9 million of expense from acquisitions made prior to the Combination. The increase in compensation was due principally to an increase of $14.5 million in stock-based compensation expense due to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor vested and unvested equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards in connection with the Combination and increased headcount. \nPublishing Adjusted EBITDA declined to a loss in 2016 due primarily to lower revenue and $15.6 million in restructuring charges related to vacating a data center and severance costs during 2016 in an effort to reduce costs in light of significant declines in revenue from the new Google contract ($9.2 million in cost of revenue, $3.1 million in selling and marketing expense, $2.3 million in general and administrative expense and $1.2 million in product development expense). Adjusted EBITDA was further impacted by decreases in selling and marketing expense, cost of revenue and general and administrative expense exclusive of the restructuring charges.\n* The Other segment consists of the results of PriceRunner, ShoeBuy and The Princeton Review for periods prior to the sales of these businesses, which occurred on March 18, 2016, December 30, 2016 and March 31, 2017, respectively. Beginning in the second quarter of 2017, as a result of the sales of these businesses, the Other segment does not include any financial results.\n (iv) restructuring charges in 2016 of $15.6 million and $2.6 million at the Publishing and Applications segments, respectively, to reduce costs in light of significant declines in revenue from the new Google contract, which was effective April 1, 2016, as well as declines from certain other legacy businesses. \nIAC has a $300 million revolving credit facility that expires on October 7, 2020. Match Group has a $500 million revolving credit facility that expires on October 7, 2020.

For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nInterest expense in 2016 increased from 2015 due to the $800 million of borrowings under the Match Group Term Loan in November 2015, of which $400 million was refinanced on June 1, 2016 with the Match Group 6.375% Senior Notes, and the 2% higher interest rate associated with the Match Group 6.75% Senior Notes which were issued in exchange for a substantially like amount of 4.75% Senior Notes, partially offset by lower interest expense due to repurchases and redemptions of the 4.875% and 4.75% Senior Notes during the year.\nThe following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of IAC's accounting policies contained in \"Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in regard to significant areas of judgment. Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others. What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.\n_________________________________________________________________________\n \u2022 Match Exchange Offer - Match Group exchanged $445 million of Match Group 6.75% Senior Notes for a substantially like amount of 4.75% Senior Notes on November 16, 2015. \nthat these lives may be changed.

See \"Principles of Financial Reporting\" for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA. \nApplications revenue decreased 21% due to a 39% decline in Partnerships and a 12% decline in Consumer. Partnerships revenue decreased due primarily to the loss of certain partners. The Consumer decline was driven by lower search revenue from our downloadable desktop applications due primarily to lower monetization, partially offset by strong growth at Apalon and SlimWare, which together comprised 12% of total Applications revenue in 2016.\nNet cash provided by financing activities includes $788.0 million in borrowings from the Match Group Term Loan, $428.8 million in net proceeds received from Match Group's initial public offering and $27.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of IAC common stock pursuant to stock-based awards, partially offset by $200.0 million used for the repurchase of 3.0 million shares of common stock at an average price of $67.68 per share, $113.2 million related to the payment of cash dividends to IAC shareholders, $80.0 million for the early redemption of the Liberty Bonds, $65.7 million for the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of IAC employees on net settled stock-based awards, $32.2 million for the purchase of noncontrolling interests, $23.4 million for the purchase of certain fully vested stock-based awards and $19.1 million of debt issuance costs primarily associated with the Match Group Term Loan and revolving credit facility.\n \u2022 The Corporate decrease was due primarily to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense resulting from the inclusion in 2015 of a modification charge and a greater number of awards being forfeited in 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by the issuance of new equity awards in 2016.  Product development expense\nCombination and Acquisitions\n\n\nOther revenue decreased 4% due to the sale of PriceRunner on March 18, 2016 and a 6% decrease in revenue at The Princeton Review, partially offset by growth at ShoeBuy. The decrease in revenue at The Princeton Review was primarily due to fewer in-person SAT test preparation courses and in-person tutoring sessions, partially offset by an increase in online and self-paced services.\n \u2022 The ANGI Homeservices increase was due primarily to an increase of $2.5 million in compensation and other employee-related costs due primarily to an increase in headcount. \n \u2022 The Match Group increase was due primarily to an increase of $7.5 million in compensation, an increase of $4.0 million in rent due to growth in the business and a decrease in income of $1.9 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments. The increase in compensation was due to an increase in headcount from both acquisitions and existing business growth, partially offset by a decrease of $2.1 million in stock-based compensation expense due primarily to the inclusion in 2015 of a modification charge related to certain equity awards, partially offset by the issuance of new equity awards since 2015. \nCorporate Adjusted EBITDA loss was essentially flat compared to 2015.\nPublishing revenue decreased 11% due to $58.8 million, or 20%, lower Ask & Other revenue, partially offset by $13.3 million, or 12%, higher Premium Brands revenue. Ask & Other revenue decreased due to declines in paid traffic primarily as a result of the Google contract. Premium Brands revenue increase was due to growth at Investopedia and Dotdash due to an increase in organic traffic and advertising revenue.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nFINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nDepreciation in 2016 increased from 2015 due primarily to acquisitions and capital expenditures, partially offset by certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated.\nFor the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2017, a qualitative assessment of the Match Group, ANGI Homeservices, Vimeo and Applications reporting units' goodwill was performed because the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values. The primary factors that the Company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units are described below:\nIn connection with the management of our businesses, we identify, measure and assess a variety of operating metrics. The principal metrics we use in managing our businesses are set forth below:\nANGI Homeservices Adjusted EBITDA increased 174% due primarily to higher revenue, partially offset by an increased investment in online and offline marketing and $2.1 million in transaction-related costs.

The increased Adjusted EBITDA loss at Vimeo, despite higher revenue, reflects our investments in marketing and product development to grow the business.\n \u2022 The Publishing decrease was due primarily to reductions of $40.0 million in traffic acquisition costs and $4.6 million in content costs driven by a decline in revenue at Ask & Other, partially offset by $9.2 million in restructuring charges in 2016 related to vacating a data center facility and severance costs in connection with a reduction in workforce. \n (i) the sale of ASKfm on June 30, 2016 (reflected in the Publishing segment) \n \u2022 The Applications increase was due primarily to a change of $13.8 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, which was due to expense of $12.0 million in 2016 versus income of $1.8 million in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in compensation due, in part, to a decrease in headcount related to a reduction in workforce that took place in the first half of 2016. \nDuring 2017, the Company repurchased 0.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of $69.73 per share, or $50.1 million in aggregate.\n \u2022 The Other decrease was due primarily to the sales of The Princeton Review and ShoeBuy. \nNet (earnings) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\nApplications Adjusted EBITDA increased 3%, despite a 4% decrease in revenue, due primarily to lower operating costs. Adjusted EBITDA in 2016 includes $2.6 million in restructuring costs.\nStock-Based Compensation\n \u2022 General and administrative expense - consists primarily of compensation (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in executive management, finance, legal, tax, human resources, and customer service functions (except for Match Group which includes customer service costs within cost of revenue), fees for professional services, facilities costs, bad debt expense, software license and maintenance costs and acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments (described below). \nThe Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $264.6 million, $104.8 million and $105.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Included in stock-based compensation expense in 2017 is $122.1 million related to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor vested and unvested equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards, the expense related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards and the acceleration of certain Angie's List equity awards resulting from the termination of employees in connection with the Combination. The Company estimated the fair value of stock options issued (including those modified in connection with the Combination) in 2017, 2016 and 2015 using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and, for those with a market condition, a lattice model. For stock options, including subsidiary denominated equity, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date at fair value and expensed over the vesting term. The impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one-year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $5.3 million, $20.3 million and $8.5 million, respectively. The Company also issues RSUs and performance-based RSUs. For RSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying IAC common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term. For performance-based RSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying IAC common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.\nWe market and offer our services and products to consumers through branded websites, allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner.

Selling and marketing expense\n2017 Developments\n \u2022 The Match Group increase was due primarily to an increase of $20.6 million in compensation, a change of $14.5 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments (expense of $5.3 million in 2017 versus income of $9.2 million in 2016) and an increase of $6.8 million in professional fees. The increase in compensation was due to an increase of $9.1 million in stock-based compensation expense due primarily to an increase in expense related to a subsidiary denominated equity award held by a non-employee, which award was settled in the third quarter of 2017, the employer portion of payroll taxes paid in connection with the exercise of Match Group options and an increase in headcount from business growth. The increase in professional fees was due primarily to the Tinder Equity Plan Settlement. \nMatch Group revenue increased 23% driven by higher Average Subscribers at both North America and International, up 22% and 46%, respectively, due primarily to growth in Subscribers at Tinder and the contribution from the 2015 acquisition of PlentyOfFish. This revenue growth was partially offset by a 6% decline in ARPU.

Marketplace Revenue growth was driven by a 37% increase in Marketplace Service Requests to 18.1 million and a 26% increase in Marketplace Paying SPs to 181,000. Revenue growth at the European business was driven by the acquisitions of controlling interests in MyHammer on November 3, 2016 and MyBuilder on March 24, 2017, as well as by organic growth across other regions. Revenue in 2017 includes a contribution of $58.9 million from Angie's List since the date of the Combination, which reflects a reduction in revenue of $7.8 million due to the write-off of deferred revenue related to the Combination.\nMatch Group Adjusted EBITDA increased 42% due primarily to higher revenue and a decrease in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue as the product mix continued to shift towards brands with lower marketing spend, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue driven by a significant increase in in-app purchase fees. Additionally, there were $11.8 million of lower costs in 2016 related to the consolidation and streamlining of technology systems and European operations ($4.9 million in 2016 compared to $16.8 million in 2015).\nThe Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future. The Company's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. The Company's indebtedness could limit our ability to: (i) obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditure or debt service or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to make acquisitions,\n (a) The Company has excluded $37.2 million in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest from the table above as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities might be paid. For additional information on income taxes, see \"Note 3-Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" \nIAC is a leading media and Internet company composed of widely known consumer brands, such as Match, Tinder, PlentyOfFish and OkCupid, which are part of Match Group's online dating portfolio, HomeAdvisor and Angie's List, which are operated by ANGI Homeservices, as well as Vimeo, Dotdash, Dictionary.com, The Daily Beast and Investopedia.\nOther Developments\ndecreased 5% and 7%, respectively, due primarily to the continued mix shift towards lower ARPU brands, including Tinder and PlentyOfFish, which had lower price points compared to Match Group's more established brands. North America ARPU decline was partially offset by an increase in mix-adjusted rates.\n \u2022 The Applications decrease was due primarily to a reduction of $52.0 million in traffic acquisition costs driven by a decline in revenue at Partnerships. \nANGI Homeservices Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $37.9 million, despite an increase of $237.5 million in revenue, due primarily to an increase in selling and marketing expense, higher compensation expense due, in part, to increase headcount, the inclusion in 2017 of $44.1 million in costs related to the Combination (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) and increases in bad debt expense due, in part, to higher Marketplace Revenue, outsourced customer service expense and software license and maintenance costs. The higher losses at the European businesses were driven primarily by the European expansion strategy, including increased investment in online and offline marketing and higher compensation costs. Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 was further impacted by write-offs of deferred revenue related to the Combination of $7.8 million and the acquisition of HomeStars of $0.7 million.\nThe aggregate goodwill balance for the reporting units for which the most recent estimate of fair value is less than 120% of their carrying values is approximately $450 million.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nIn 2017, the Company's revenue increased $167.4 million, or 5%, operating income increased $221.1 million from a loss of $32.6 million in the prior year and Adjusted EBITDA grew $74.1 million, or 15%. Revenue increased due primarily to an increase of $237.5 million from ANGI Homeservices due, in part, to the Combination, growth of $212.6 million from Match Group and $48.3 million from Video, partially offset by a decline of $259.4 million from Other due to the sales of ShoeBuy, The Princeton Review and PriceRunner on December 30, 2016, March 31, 2017 and March 18, 2016, respectively, and a decline of $45.5 million from Publishing primarily due to the effects of the Google contract. The operating income increase was due primarily to the inclusion in 2016 of a $275.4 million goodwill impairment charge at Publishing, an increase of $74.1 million in Adjusted EBITDA, described below, and a decrease of $37.3 million in amortization of intangibles, partially offset by an increase of $159.8 million in stock-based compensation expense due, in part, to the Combination. The goodwill impairment charge at Publishing in 2016 was driven by the impact from the Google contract, traffic trends and monetization challenges. The Adjusted EBITDA increase was due primarily to growth of $65.6 million from Match Group, a profit from Publishing of $31.5 million in 2017 compared to a loss of $7.6 million in 2016 and growth of $4.5 million from Applications, partially offset by increased losses of $14.5 million from Corporate, $9.2 million from Video and a decline of $8.0 million from ANGI Homeservices due primarily to costs of $44.1 million (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) and deferred revenue write-offs of $7.8 million related to the Combination.\n\nDepreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.\nGoodwill is the Company's largest asset with a carrying value of $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying value of $459.1 million and $320.6 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nquarter, and the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of shareholders' equity. The specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. The Company recognizes unrealized losses on marketable securities in net earnings when the losses are determined to be other-than-temporary. Additionally, the Company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis, and recognizes an impairment loss if the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary. Future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as other-than-temporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the Company's investments to decline.\nOperating income (loss)\n\nIn July 2017, Match Group elected to convert all outstanding equity awards of its wholly-owned subsidiary Tinder, which awards were primarily held by current and former Tinder employees, to stock options of Match Group (the \"Tinder Equity Plan Settlement\"). Subsequently, during 2017, Match Group made cash payments of approximately $520 million to cover both withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees exercising these converted awards, as these awards were net settled, and the purchase of certain fully vested awards.\n\nIAC reports Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. IAC endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.\nThe Transition Tax on deemed repatriated foreign earnings is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits (\"E&P\") of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. To determine the amount of the Transition Tax, the Company must determine, among other factors, the amount of post-1986 E&P of its foreign subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. The Company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the Transition Tax and has recorded a provisional transition tax expense of $62.7 million. Any adjustment of the Company's provisional tax expense will be reflected as a change in estimate in its results in the period in which the change in estimate is made in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company is continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of the Transition Tax and expects to finalize its calculation prior to the filing of its U.S. federal tax return, which is due on October 15, 2018. The additional information includes, but is not limited to, the allocation and sourcing of income and deductions in 2017 for purposes of calculating the utilization of foreign tax credits. In addition, our estimates may also be impacted and adjusted as the law is clarified and additional guidance is issued at the federal and state levels.\nMANAGEMENT OVERVIEW\nOn August 14, 2017, Match Group increased its Term Loan by $75 million to $425 million, repriced the outstanding balance at LIBOR plus 2.50% and reduced the LIBOR floor to 0.00%. Previously, the interest charged on the Match Group Term Loan was LIBOR plus 3.25%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%.\nGoogle contract, traffic trends and monetization challenges. The decrease in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to lower expense in 2017 as a result of a Publishing trade name and certain intangible assets from the PlentyOfFish acquisition now being fully amortized, partially offset by expense in 2017 related to the Combination. Amortization of intangibles was further impacted by the inclusion of an impairment charge in 2016 of $11.6 million related to certain Publishing indefinite-lived trade names. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to an increase of $140.3 million at ANGI Homeservices due primarily to the modification and acceleration charges related to the Combination, as well as an increase in expense related to a subsidiary denominated equity award held by a non-employee, which award was settled during the third quarter of 2017, and the issuance of new equity awards since 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 The Publishing decrease was due primarily to the effect of the reductions in workforce in 2016, $2.3 million in restructuring costs included in 2016 and the sale of ASKfm on June 30, 2016.  For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nNet cash used in investing activities includes acquisitions and purchases of investments of $651.9 million, which includes PlentyOfFish, and capital expenditures of $62.0 million, primarily related to investments in development of capitalized software to support our products and services, and computer hardware, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities (net of purchases) of marketable securities of $125.3 million, and net proceeds from the sale of long-term investments and an asset of $9.4 million.\nOther income, net in 2015 included a gain of $34.3 million from a real estate transaction, $5.4 million in net foreign currency exchange gains due to the strengthening of the dollar relative to the Euro and $4.3 million in interest income, partially offset by $6.7 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain investments and expense of $2.3 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment pertaining to a subsidiary denominated equity award held by a non-employee.\n (b) Represents contractual amounts due including interest on both fixed and variable rate instruments. Long-term debt at December 31, 2017 consists of $1.4 billion, bearing interest at fixed rates and a $425.0 million Match Group Term Loan and a $275.0 million ANGI Homeservices Term Loan bearing interest at variable rates. The Match Group Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50%, or 3.85%, at December 31, 2017. The ANGI Homeservices Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%, or 3.38% at December 31, 2017. The amount of interest ultimately paid on the Match Group and ANGI Homeservices term loans may differ based on changes in interest rates. For additional information on long-term debt arrangements, see \"Note 9-Long-term Debt\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" \nANGI Homeservices revenue is primarily derived from consumer connection revenue, which includes fees paid by service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the professional ultimately provides the requested service) and membership subscription fees paid by service professionals. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon certain factors including the service requested, type of match (such as Instant Booking, Instant Connect, same day service or next day service) and geographic location of service. Effective with the Combination (described below), revenue is also derived from Angie's List sales of time-based advertising to service professionals and membership subscription fees from consumers.\nMatch Group Adjusted EBITDA increased 16% due primarily to an increase of $212.6 million in revenue and lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue due to the ongoing product mix towards brands with lower marketing spend and a reduction in marketing spend at Match Group's affinity brands, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue, general and administrative expense and product development expense. General and administrative expense and product development expense increased due, in part, to expense of $12.7 million associated with the employer portion of payroll taxes and professional fees resulting from the Tinder Equity Plan Settlement.\n \u2022 The Video decrease was due primarily to a reduction of $8.9 million in online marketing driven primarily by Vimeo. \n \u2022 PlentyOfFish on October 28, 2015 (reflected in the Match Group segment); and \n \u2022 The Corporate increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs in 2017, including an increase in stock-based compensation expense due primarily to the issuance of new equity awards since 2016 and higher professional fees. \nCost of revenue in 2017 decreased from 2016 due to decreases of $169.4 million from Other, $31.6 million from Publishing and $20.9 million from Applications, partially offset by increases of $83.9 million from Match Group, $25.9 million from Video and $8.2 million from ANGI Homeservices.\nAs of December 31, 2017, IAC's economic and voting interest in Match Group is 81.2% and 97.6%, respectively, and in ANGI Homeservices is 86.9% and 98.5%, respectively. Certain Match Group and ANGI Homeservices equity awards can be settled either in IAC common shares or the common shares of these subsidiaries at IAC's election. The Company currently expects to settle a sufficient number of awards in IAC shares to maintain an economic interest in both Match Group and ANGI Homeservices of at least 80%.\n \u2022 The Match Group increase was due primarily to an increase of $20.7 million in compensation driven by an increase of $14.4 million related to increased headcount and the employer portion of payroll taxes paid in connection with the exercise of Match Group options, and an increase of $6.3 million in stock-based compensation expense due primarily to new grants issued since 2016. \nWe review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. In addition, the Company reviews the useful lives of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2017 primarily represents the publicly-held interest in Match Group's earnings, partially offset by ANGI Homeservices losses.\n \u2022 4.875% Senior Notes - The outstanding balance of $361.9 million was redeemed on November 30, 2017, using a portion of the proceeds from the Exchangeable Notes. \nKey Terms:\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Act. The Tax Act subjects to U.S. taxation certain previously deferred earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 ( Transition Tax\u201d) and implements a number of changes that take effect on January 1, 2018, including but not limited to, a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and a new minimum tax on intangible income earned by foreign subsidiaries. The Company's income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes an expense of $63.8 million related to the Tax Act, of which, $62.7 million relates to the Transition Tax and $1.1 million relates to the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate. The Company has sufficient current year net operating losses to offset the taxable income resulting from the Transition Tax and, therefore, will not be required to pay the one-time Transition Tax.\nSelling and marketing expense in 2017 increased from 2016 due to increases of $157.3 million from ANGI Homeservices, $26.5 million from Match Group and $17.5 million from Video, partially offset by decreases of $37.6 million from Publishing and $22.3 million from Other.\nOn October 2, 2017, a finance subsidiary of the Company issued $517.5 million aggregate principal amount of Exchangeable Notes due October 1, 2022, which notes are guaranteed by the Company and are exchangeable into shares of the Company's common stock. The proceeds from these notes were, in part, loaned to IAC, which repaid the outstanding balance of its 4.875% Senior Notes of $361.9 million on November 30, 2017. Each $1,000 of principal of the Exchangeable Notes is exchangeable for 6.5713 shares of the Company's common stock, which is equivalent to an exchange price of approximately $152.18 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.\nCash Flow Information\nA meaningful portion of the Company's revenue is attributable to the services agreement with Google described above. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenue earned from Google represents 22%, 26% and 40%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue.\nThe Company evaluates and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. Recognition (step one) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustainable upon examination. Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. De-recognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when the Company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits of $39.7 million and $41.0 million, including interest and penalties, respectively. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Although management currently believes changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.\n \u2022 The Applications decrease was due primarily to a reduction of $16.6 million in traffic acquisition costs driven by a decline in revenue at Partnerships and a decrease of $2.9 million in compensation due, in part, to the reductions in workforce in 2016. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\n \u2022 Average Revenue per Subscriber (or \"ARPU\") - is Direct Revenue from Subscribers in the relevant measurement period (whether in the form of subscription or \u00e0 la carte) divided by the Average Subscribers in such period and further divided by the number of calendar days in such period. Direct Revenue from users who are not Subscribers and have purchased only \u00e0 la carte features is not included in ARPU. \n \u2022 The Other decrease was due primarily to decreases in consulting expenses and non-income tax related items at The Princeton Review. \nFor a detailed description of the Publishing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, see \"Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nBusiness Combinations and Contingent Consideration Arrangements\n (d) At December 31, 2017 and 2016, cash and cash equivalents include Match Group's domestic and international cash and cash equivalents of $203.5 million and $69.2 million; and $114.0 million and $139.6 million, respectively. Match Group is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and board of directors and has no obligation to provide the Company with funds. As a result, we cannot freely access the cash of Match Group and its subsidiaries. Match Group generated $321.1 million and $259.6 million of operating cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, agreements governing Match Group's indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or distributions, loans or advances to stockholders, including the Company, in the event a default has occurred or Match Group's leverage ratio (as defined in the indentures) exceeds 5.0 to 1.0. \nApplications Adjusted EBITDA decreased 28% due primarily to lower revenue, partially offset by decreases in cost of revenue and selling and marketing expense. Adjusted EBITDA was further impacted by $2.6 million in restructuring charges.\n \u2022 The Match Group increase was primarily related to an increase of $7.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, increased headcount at Tinder, and the 2015 acquisitions of PlentyOfFish and Pairs. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due primarily to the issuance of new equity awards and a net increase in expense associated with the modification of certain equity awards since 2015. \nRecoverability and Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets\nOther income, net in 2016 includes gains of $37.5 million and $12.0 million related to the sale of ShoeBuy and PriceRunner, respectively, $34.4 million in net foreign currency exchange gains due to strengthening of the dollar relative to the British Pound and Euro, interest income of $5.1 million and a $3.6 million gain related to the sale of marketable equity securities, partially offset by a non-cash charge of $12.1 million related to the write-off of a proportionate share of original issue discount and deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of $440 million of the Match Group Term Loan, $10.7 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain investments, a loss of $3.8 million related to the sale of ASKfm, a $3.6 million loss on the 4.75% and 4.875% Senior Note redemptions and repurchases and an expense of $2.5 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment pertaining to a subsidiary denominated equity award held by a non-employee.\n \u2022 The ANGI Homeservices increase was due primarily to the inclusion of expense of $3.7 million from Angie's List resulting from the Combination, an increase of $2.8 million in credit card processing fees due to higher revenue and an increase of $1.6 million in hosting fees, partially offset by a reduction in traffic acquisition costs of $0.4 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\n \u2022 The ANGI Homeservices increase was due primarily to higher compensation of $10.8 million due, in part, to increased headcount, an increase in bad debt expense due to higher Marketplace Revenue, an increase in software license and maintenance costs and $2.1 million in transaction-related costs in 2016. \nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the balance of deferred tax assets (liabilities), net, is $31.3 million and $(226.3) million, respectively.\nThe Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. Such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition, the rate at which the investee utilizes cash and the investee's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee's existing business model due to changing business and regulatory environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $12.2 million, $10.7 million and $6.7 million, respectively, related to cost and equity method investments.\n \u2022 The Applications decrease was due primarily to the inclusion in 2016 of $12.0 million in expense related to an acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustment and a $2.9 million favorable legal settlement in 2017. \nNM = Not meaningful.\nMatch Group's revenue is primarily derived directly from users in the form of recurring subscription fees, which typically provide unlimited access to a bundle of features for a specific period of time. Revenue is also derived from \u00e0 la carte features, where users pay a fee for a specific action or event, and from online advertisers who pay to reach our large audiences.\nAt December 31, 2017, there was $423.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.5 years.\n \u2022 Subscribers - are users who purchase a subscription to one of Match Group's products. Users who purchase only \u00e0 la carte features are not included in Subscribers. \nFor a detailed description of IAC, Match Group and ANGI Homeservices long-term debt, see \"Note 9-Long-term Debt\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nVideo revenue increased 7% due primarily to growth at Electus, Vimeo and Daily Burn, partially offset by lower revenue from IAC Films as 2015 benefited from the release of the movie While We're Young. Vimeo's ending subscribers were 768,000, an increase of 14%, compared to 2015.\nIn 2017, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $291.1 million, which was due primarily to the effect of adopting the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, on January 1, 2017 and foreign income taxed at lower rates, partially offset by the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) discussed below. Under ASU No. 2016-09, excess tax benefits generated by the exercise, purchase or settlement of stock-based awards of $361.8 million in 2017 are recognized as a reduction to the income tax provision rather than as an increase to additional paid-in capital.\nNet cash provided by investing activities includes net proceeds from the sale of businesses, investments and assets of $172.2 million, which mainly relate to the sale of PriceRunner and ShoeBuy, partially offset by capital expenditures of $78.0 million, primarily related to investments in development of capitalized software at Match Group and ANGI Homeservices to support their products and services, as well as leasehold improvements and computer hardware, purchases (net of sales and maturities) of marketable debt securities of $61.6 million, and cash used in acquisitions and purchases of investments of $31.0 million.\n (c) At December 31, 2017, marketable securities consist of commercial paper rated A1+/P1 with an initial maturity of more than 91 days. At December 31, 2016, marketable securities consist of commercial paper rated A1/P1, treasury discount notes, and short-to-medium-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers. The Company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed. The Company also may invest in equity securities as part of its investment strategy. \nOther events affecting year-over-year comparability that occurred prior to 2017 include:\nSources of Revenue\nAmortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions (including the Combination). At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as contractor and service professional relationships, technology, customer lists and user base, content, trade names and membership, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.\nNet cash used in financing activities includes principal payments made on Match Group and IAC debt of $445.2 million and $393.5 million, respectively, the payment of $272.5 million for the purchase of certain fully vested stock-based awards, the payment of $254.2 million, $93.8 million and $10.1 million for withholding taxes paid on behalf of Match Group, IAC and ANGI Homeservices employees, respectively, on net settled stock-based awards, $74.4 million for the Exchangeable Notes hedge, $56.4 million for the repurchase of 0.8 million shares of IAC common stock at an average price of $69.24 per share, $33.7 million of debt issuance costs primarily related to the Exchangeable Notes and the 5.00% Match Group Senior Notes, $27.3 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration payments (included in operating activities is $11.1 million for an acquisition-related contingent consideration payment made in excess of the amount initially recognized at the time of acquisition) and $15.4 million for the purchase of noncontrolling interests, partially offset by $525.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of Match Group debt, $517.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes, $275.0 million in proceeds from the ANGI Homeservices Term Loan, $82.4 million and $59.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of IAC and Match Group common stock, respectively, pursuant to stock-based awards, $23.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of warrants, a $20.1 million decrease in restricted cash that relates to settled IAC bond redemptions and $10.6 million of funds returned from escrow for the MyHammer tender offer.\n \u2022 The Publishing decrease was due primarily to lower compensation and other employee-related costs of $3.8 million due, in part, to reductions in workforce in 2016 including $1.2 million in restructuring costs in 2016 and the sale of ASKfm. \n \u2022 The Applications decrease was due primarily to a decrease of $3.6 million in compensation due, in part, to a decrease in headcount related to reductions in workforce in 2016.  For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nNet cash provided by operating activities consists of earnings adjusted for non-cash items, the effect of changes in working capital and acquisition-related contingent consideration payments (to the extent greater than the liability initially recognized at the time of acquisition). Non-cash adjustments include stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, goodwill impairments, deferred income taxes, acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, gains from the sale of businesses and investments and a real estate transaction, impairments of long-term investments and bad debt expense.\n \u2022 The Other decrease was due to the sales of ShoeBuy and The Princeton Review. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nGeneral and administrative expense in 2017 increased from 2016 due to increases of $192.9 million from ANGI Homeservices, $44.8 million from Match Group and $20.0 million from Corporate, partially offset by decreases of $58.5 million from Other, $10.2 million from Applications and $9.0 million from Publishing.\nVideo revenue increased 21% driven by the sales of The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) and The Legacy of a Whitetail Deer Hunter and the release of Lady Bird at IAC Films and strong growth at Vimeo, which had ending subscribers of 873,000, an increase of 14% year-over-year, partially offset by a decline at Electus.\n \u2022 Match Group 6.75% Senior Notes - Match Group's 6.75% Senior Notes due December 15, 2022, with interest payable each June 15 and December 15. Match Group's 6.75% Senior Notes were issued in exchange for the 4.75% Senior Notes on November 16, 2015. The outstanding balance of $445.2 million was redeemed on December 17, 2017 with the proceeds from the Match Group 5.00% Senior Notes (described below) and cash on hand. \n________________________\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements. We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments, and this measure is one of the primary metrics by which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses.\n \u2022 The Publishing increase was due primarily to $1.2 million in restructuring charges related to severance costs in connection with a reduction in workforce. \nHomeAdvisor acquired controlling interests in MyBuilder Limited (\"MyBuilder\") on March 24, 2017, and HomeStars Inc. (\"HomeStars\") on February 8, 2017, leading home services platforms in the United Kingdom and Canada, respectively.\nOther Adjusted EBITDA decreased 62% due to the sale of PriceRunner in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by profits from The Princeton Review in 2016 and improved Adjusted EBITDA at ShoeBuy resulting from increased revenue.\n (b) Internationally, cash equivalents primarily consist of AAA rated government money market funds and time deposits with maturities of less than 91 days. Approximately $420 million of the Company's international cash can be repatriated without any significant tax consequences as it has been substantially subjected to U.S. income taxes due to the Transition Tax imposed by the Tax Act. If needed for our U.S. operations, the remaining cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries could be repatriated, however, under current law, would be subject to foreign, federal and state income taxes of approximately $8 million. We have not provided for any such tax because the Company currently does not anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to finance our U.S. operations and it is the Company's intent to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. \n \u2022 Applications - consists of Consumer, which includes our direct-to-consumer downloadable desktop applications, Apalon, which houses our mobile operations, and SlimWare, which houses our downloadable desktop software and service operations; and Partnerships, which includes our business-to-business partnership operations. \nPublishing Adjusted EBITDA improved to a profit of $31.5 million in 2017 from a loss of $7.6 million in 2016, despite lower revenue, due primarily to lower operating costs resulting from restructurings in 2016 and the sale of ASKfm. Results in 2016 included $15.6 million in restructuring charges related to vacating a data center and severance costs in an effort to reduce costs in light of significant declines in revenue from the new Google contract.\n \u2022 Acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments - relate to the portion of the purchase price of certain acquisitions that is contingent upon the future operating performance of the acquired company. The amounts ultimately paid are generally dependent upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics as stipulated in the relevant purchase agreements. The fair value of the liability is estimated at the date of acquisition and adjusted each reporting period until the liability is settled. If the payment date of the liability is longer than one year, the amount is initially recorded net of a discount, which is amortized as an expense each period. In a period where the acquired company is expected to perform better than the previous estimate, the liability will be increased resulting in additional expense; and in a period when the acquired company is expected to perform worse than the previous estimate, the liability will be decreased resulting in income. The year-over-year impact can be significant, for example, if there is income in one period and expense in the other period. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $264.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, $74.3 million of depreciation, $42.1 million of amortization of intangibles, $28.9 million of bad debt expense, $12.2 million of impairments on long-term investments, and $43.6 million of other adjustments, which primarily consist of losses on bond redemptions and net foreign currency exchange losses, partially offset by $285.3 million of deferred income taxes and $32.7 million of net gains from the sale of businesses and investments. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to the net operating loss created primarily by excess tax benefits of $361.8 million related to stock-based awards and the modification charge for the conversion and acceleration of stock-based awards in connection with the Combination, partially offset by the provisional Transition Tax. The decrease from changes in working capital consists primarily of an increase in accounts receivable of $115.2 million and a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities of $14.1 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $39.2 million. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to (i) the timing of cash receipts and revenue increasingly sourced through mobile app stores at Match Group, which are settled more slowly than traditional credit cards; and (ii) revenue growth at ANGI Homeservices. The decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities is due to: (i) a decrease at Match Group due to the cash settlement of former subsidiary denominated equity awards held by a non-employee, (ii) a decrease in accrued employee compensation mainly related to the timing of payments of cash bonuses, partially offset by (iii) an increase\nThe 2017 annual assessment did not identify any impairments. While the 2016 annual assessment did not identify any material impairments, during the second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded impairment charges equal to the entire $275.4 million balance of the Publishing reporting unit goodwill and $11.6 million related to certain Publishing indefinite-lived intangible assets. The 2015 annual assessment identified impairment charges related to certain intangible assets of the Publishing reporting unit and the goodwill on the ShoeBuy reporting unit of $88.0 million and $14.1 million, respectively.\nStock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions (including the Combination), of stock options, restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), performance-based RSUs and market-based awards. These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method; however, performance-based RSUs and market-based awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market condition(s) have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period). Upon the exercise of stock options and market-based stock options, the awards are gross settled, and the vesting of RSUs, performance-based RSUs and market-based awards RSUs, the awards are settled, on a net basis, with the Company remitting the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nOn December 4, 2017, Match Group completed a private offering of $450 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.00% Senior Notes due December 15, 2027. The proceeds from these notes, along with cash on hand, were used to redeem the outstanding balance of the Match Group 6.75% Senior Notes of $445.2 million on December 17, 2017.\nThe Company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations. The Company's 2018 capital expenditures are expected to be higher than 2017 by approximately 20% to 25%, driven, in part, by higher capital expenditures for ANGI Homeservices and Match Group related to the\nFinancial Position\nin accrued advertising at Match Group. The increase in deferred revenue is due mainly to growth in subscription sales at Match Group and Vimeo, as well as growth in subscription sales and time-based advertising to service professionals at ANGI Homeservices, partially offset by decreases at Electus and Notional mainly due to the delivery of programming related to various production deals.\n \u2022 North America - consists of the financial results and metrics associated with users located in the United States and Canada. \n \u2022 Match Group's October 1, 2017 market capitalization of $6.3 billion exceeded its carrying value by more than 1100% and Match Group's strong operating performance. \n \u2022 The Video increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation at Vimeo due, in part, to increased headcount. \n \u2022 Match Group Term Loan - a seven-year term loan entered into by Match Group on November 16, 2015 in the original amount of $800 million. During 2016, Match Group made $450 million of principal payments, $400 million of which was funded from proceeds of the 6.375% Senior Notes (described below). On August 14, 2017, the Match Group Term Loan was increased by $75 million to $425 million, repriced the outstanding balance at LIBOR plus 2.50% and reduced the LIBOR floor to 0.00%. The outstanding balance of the Match Group Term Loan as of December 31, 2017 is $425 million. The interest rate on the Match Group Term Loan at December 31, 2017 is 3.85%. \nThe annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.\nIncome Taxes\n \u2022 MyHammer Holding AG (\"MyHammer\") on November 3, 2016 (reflected in the ANGI Homeservices segment) \nNoncontrolling interests represent the noncontrolling holders' percentage share of earnings or losses from the subsidiaries in which the Company holds a majority, but less than 100%, ownership interest and the results of which are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $140.0 million of amortization of intangibles, $105.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, $62.2 million of depreciation, $16.6 million of bad debt expense and $14.1 million of goodwill impairment, partially offset by $59.8 million of deferred income taxes, $34.3 million of gain on a real estate transaction, and $15.5 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. The increase from changes in working capital consists primarily of an increase in deferred revenue of $66.9 million and an increase in income taxes payable and receivable of $24.2 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $29.7 million and an increase in other assets of $21.2 million. The increase in deferred revenue was due mainly to growth in subscription sales at Match Group, Vimeo and ANGI Homeservices, increases related to acquisitions, and increases at Electus, CollegeHumor and Notional mainly due to the timing of various production deals. The increase in income taxes payable and receivable was due to 2015 income tax accruals in excess of 2015 income tax payments. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to growth in Match Group's in-app purchases sold through their mobile products and revenue growth at ANGI Homeservices. The increase in other assets was primarily due to Match Group, relating to an increase in prepaid expenses, primarily from growth and the signing of longer-term contracts, as well as an increase in VAT refund receivables in the Publishing segment.\n \u2022 The Publishing decrease was due primarily to a reduction of $132.6 million in online marketing, resulting from a decline in revenue, partially offset by $3.1 million in restructuring charges in 2016 related to severance costs in connection with a reduction in workforce. \n (e) Commercial commitments are funding commitments that could potentially require registrant performance in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nSelling and marketing expense in 2016 decreased from 2015 due to decreases of $130.2 million from Publishing, $40.1 million from Applications and $11.1 million from Video, partially offset by an increase of $80.8 million from ANGI Homeservices.\n \u2022 Product development expense - consists primarily of compensation (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs that are not capitalized for personnel engaged in the design, development, testing and enhancement of product offerings and related technology. \n2017 Consolidated Results\nIn connection with the Combination, previously issued stock appreciation rights that related to common stock of HomeAdvisor (US) were converted into stock appreciation rights that are settleable in Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices. IAC has the right to settle these awards using shares of IAC common stock. Assuming all vested and unvested stock appreciation rights outstanding on December 31, 2017 were exercised on a net basis on that date and settled using IAC stock, 1.4 million IAC common shares would have been issued in settlement. ANGI Homeservices would have remitted $171.3 million in cash in withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate) on behalf of the employees and issued 16.4 million of its common shares to IAC as reimbursement.\n \u2022 The Publishing decrease was due primarily to reductions of $15.2 million in traffic acquisition costs driven by a decline in revenue at Ask & Other, $8.4 million in rent expense due to vacating a data center in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $6.5 million in content costs due primarily to Dotdash due, in part, to its vertical brand strategy which launched in the second quarter of 2016. \nFor a reconciliation of operating income (loss) by reportable segment and net (loss) earnings attributable to IAC shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 see \"Note 14-Segment Information\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nOn November 1, 2017, ANGI Homeservices borrowed $275 million under a five-year term loan facility.\n \u2022 Marketplace (formerly HomeAdvisor Domestic) Paying Service Professionals (or \"Marketplace Paying SPs\") - are the number of HomeAdvisor domestic service professionals that had an active membership and/or paid for consumer matches in the last month of the period.  Video\n \u2022 The Match Group increase was due primarily to a significant increase in in-app purchase fees across multiple brands, including Tinder, and the 2015 acquisitions of PlentyOfFish and Pairs. \nReportable Segments:\nGains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business.\n \u2022 Match Group 6.375% Senior Notes - Match Group's 6.375% Senior Notes due June 1, 2024, with interest payable each June 1 and December 1. The outstanding balance of the Match Group 6.375% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2017 is $400 million. \n \u2022 The Match Group increase was due primarily to higher offline and online marketing of $15.3 million and an increase in compensation of $9.1 million. The increase in marketing is due primarily to an increase in strategic investments in certain international markets at the Tinder business and increased marketing related to the launch of a new brand in Europe, partially offset by a reduction in marketing spend at Match Group's affinity brands. The increase in compensation is primarily related to an increase in headcount at Tinder and the employer portion of payroll taxes paid in connection with the exercise of Match Group options. As a percentage of revenue, selling and marketing expense decreased due primarily to a continued shift towards brands with lower marketing spend and reductions in marketing spend at the affinity brands. \nMatch Group revenue increased 19% driven by International Direct Revenue growth of $146.3 million, or 38%, and North America Direct Revenue growth of $67.6 million, or 10%. Both International and North America Direct Revenue growth were driven by higher Average Subscribers, up 33% and 9%, respectively, due primarily to continued growth in Subscribers at Tinder. Total ARPU increased 1%.\nOther (expense) income, net\n\nProduct development expense in 2017 increased from 2016 due to increases of $27.3 million from ANGI Homeservices, $23.0 million from Match Group and $5.2 million from Video, partially offset by decreases of $6.3 million from Publishing, $4.6 million from Other and $4.4 million from Applications.\nA substantial portion of the revenue from our Applications and Publishing segments is derived from online advertising, most of which is attributable to our services agreement with Google Inc. (\"Google\"). The Company's services agreement became effective on April 1, 2016, following the expiration of the previous services agreement. The services agreement expires on March 31, 2020; however, the Company may choose to terminate the agreement effective March 31, 2019. The services agreement requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google, and Google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice. Any such updates could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenue earned from Google was $740.7 million, $824.4 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenue earned from Google represents 83%, 87% and 94% of Applications revenue and 71%, 73% and 83% of Publishing revenue, respectively.\n \u2022 The Video increase was due primarily to increases in both online and offline marketing at Vimeo and IAC Films of $10.6 million and $6.5 million, respectively, and compensation at Vimeo and Electus of $2.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of $3.5 million in offline marketing at Daily Burn. \nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\n \u2022 The Video increase was due primarily to the acquisition of Livestream. \nApplications revenue decreased 4% due to a decrease of $37.8 million, or 27%, in Partnerships, partially offset by an increase of $11.7 million, or 3%, in Consumer. Partnerships revenue continued to decline due primarily to the loss of certain partners. The growth in Consumer was due primarily to growth of 37% at Apalon, driven by higher advertising and subscription revenue, and growth at SlimWare, driven by higher subscription revenue, partially offset by lower revenue per query at the Consumer desktop applications business. Apalon and SlimWare together comprised 16% of total Applications revenue in 2017.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \u2022 Cost of revenue - consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs and includes (i) fees paid to Apple and Google related to the distribution and the facilitation of in-app purchases of product features and (ii) payments made to partners who distribute our Partnerships customized browser-based applications and who integrate our paid listings into their websites. These payments include amounts based on revenue share and other arrangements. Cost of revenue also includes production costs related to media produced by Electus and other businesses within our Video segment, hosting fees, compensation (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in data center operations and Match Group customer service functions, credit card processing fees, content costs, and expenses associated with the operation of the Company's data centers. For periods prior to the sale of The Princeton Review and ShoeBuy, cost of revenue also includes rent and cost for teachers and tutors and cost of products sold, including shipping and handling costs, respectively. \nAcquisitions are an important part of the Company's growth strategy. The Company invested $912.1 million (including the value of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock issued in connection with the Combination), $36.1 million and $650.7 million in acquisitions in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. The fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. The excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.\nDefinition of Non-GAAP Measure\nOn October 18, 2017, Vimeo acquired Livestream, a leading live video solution that powers millions of events a year.\nRecoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2016 primarily represented the proportionate share of the noncontrolling holders' ownership in Match Group.\nNo income taxes have been provided on indefinitely reinvested cash earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of $101.2 million at December 31, 2017. The estimated amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to such cash earnings would be $7.9 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities includes $450.0 million in principal payments on Match Group debt, $308.9 million for the repurchase of 6.2 million shares of IAC common stock at an average price of $49.74 per share, $126.4 million in principal payments on IAC debt and $29.8 million and $26.7 million for the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of Match Group and IAC employees, respectively, on net settled stock-based awards, partially offset by $400.0 million in\n \u2022 The Publishing decrease was due primarily to the sale of ASKfm and a decrease in bad debt expense, partially offset by $2.3 million in restructuring charges in 2016 primarily related to severance costs in connection with a reduction in workforce. \n \u2022 Marketplace (formerly HomeAdvisor Domestic) Service Requests - are fully completed and submitted domestic customer service requests on HomeAdvisor. \nThe ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.\n \u2022 The Other increase was due primarily to an increase in cost of products sold at ShoeBuy due to increased sales, partially offset by a mix shift to higher margin online products from in-person courses at The Princeton Review and the sale of PriceRunner. \nMarketable Securities and Long-term Investments\nquantitatively tested the Daily Burn and Electus reporting units. The Company's quantitative test indicated that the fair value of each of these reporting units is in excess of its respective carrying value; therefore, the goodwill of these reporting units is not impaired. The Company's Publishing reporting unit has no goodwill.\n \u2022 The Company performed valuations of the Vimeo and Applications reporting units during 2017. These valuations were prepared primarily in connection with the issuance and/or settlement of equity grants that are denominated in the equity of these businesses. The valuations were prepared time proximate to, however, not as of, October 1, 2017. The fair value of each of these businesses was in excess of its October 1, 2017 carrying value.  The Company foregoes a qualitative assessment and tests the goodwill for impairment when it concludes that it is more likely than not that there may be an impairment. For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2017, the Company\n\nPRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING\n (c) The Company leases land, office space, data center facilities and equipment used in connection with operations under various operating leases, many of which contain escalation clauses. The Company is also committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under a data center lease agreement. These operating expenses are not included in the table above. For additional information on operating leases, see \"Note 15-Commitments and Contingencies\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" \nOther than the items described above, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2017.\n\nAt December 31, 2017, marketable securities of $5.0 million consist of commercial paper rated A1+/P1. Long-term investments at December 31, 2017 of $65.0 million include equity securities accounted for under the cost and equity methods.\nThe Company has granted stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights denominated in the equity of certain non-publicly traded subsidiaries to employees and management of those subsidiaries. These equity awards vest over a period of years or upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events. The value of the stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights is tied to the value of the common stock of these subsidiaries. Accordingly, these interests only have value to the extent the relevant business appreciates in value above the initial value utilized to determine the exercise price. These interests can have significant value in the event of significant appreciation. The interests are ultimately settled in IAC common stock with fair market value generally determined by negotiation or arbitration. These equity awards are settled on a net basis, with the award holder entitled to receive a payment in IAC shares equal to the intrinsic value of the award at exercise less an amount equal to the required cash tax withholding payment. The number of shares ultimately needed to settle these awards may vary significantly as a result of both movements in our stock price and a determination of fair value of the relevant subsidiary that is different than our estimate. The number of IAC common shares that would be required to settle these interests, other than for Match Group and ANGI Homeservices subsidiaries, at current estimated fair values, including vested and unvested interests, at December 31, 2017 is 0.1 million shares. Withholding taxes, which will be paid by the Company on behalf of the employees upon exercise, would have been $15.2 million at December 31, 2017, assuming a 50% withholding rate.\n \u2022 The Match Group increase was due primarily to increases of $75.4 million in in-app purchase fees and $5.9 million in hosting fees. The increases were due primarily to the growth at Tinder. \nOperating income in 2017 increased from a loss in 2016 due primarily to the inclusion in 2016 of a $275.4 million goodwill impairment charge at Publishing, an increase of $74.1 million in Adjusted EBITDA described below, and a decrease of $37.3 million in amortization of intangibles, partially offset by an increase of $159.8 million in stock-based compensation expense, a change of $3.2 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments and an increase of $2.6 million in depreciation expense. The goodwill impairment charge at Publishing in 2016 was driven by the impact from the\ndevelopment of capitalized software to support our products and services and for ANGI Homeservices' new corporate headquarters, partially offset by lower capital expenditures at Corporate.\nIn May 2017, the Board of Directors of Match Group authorized Match Group to repurchase up to 6 million shares of its common stock. Match Group has not repurchased any shares related to this repurchase authorization.\nANGI Homeservices revenue increased 38% due primarily to 44% growth at Marketplace and 18% growth at the European business. Marketplace Revenue growth was driven by a 34% increase in Marketplace Service Requests to 13.2 million and a 41% increase in Marketplace Paying SPs to 143,000. Revenue growth at the European business was driven by organic growth across all regions as well as the acquisition of a controlling interest in MyHammer.\nOn October 23, 2017, Match Group sold a cost method investment for net proceeds of $60.2 million. The gain on sale of $9.1 million is included in \"Other (expense) income, net\" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nStrategic Partnerships, Advertiser Relationships and Online Advertising\nWhen the following terms appear in this report, they have the meanings indicated below:\nGeneral and administrative expense in 2016 increased from 2015 due to increases of $22.1 million from ANGI Homeservices, $12.6 million from Match Group and $10.5 million from Applications, partially offset by decreases of $14.1 million from Publishing, $10.9 million from Other and $3.0 million from Corporate.\n \u2022 ANGI Homeservices Term Loan - a five-year term loan entered into by ANGI Homeservices on November 1, 2017 in the amount of $275 million. The ANGI Homeservices Term Loan currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%. The outstanding balance of the ANGI Homeservices Term Loan as of December 31, 2017 is $275 million. The interest rate on the ANGI Homeservices Term Loan at December 31, 2017 is 3.38%.  See \"Note 9-Long-term Debt\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further information.\nNon-GAAP financial measure:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nCost of revenue in 2016 decreased from 2015 due to decreases of $54.7 million from Applications and $47.0 million from Publishing, partially offset by increases of $61.3 million from Match Group, $7.7 million from Video, $7.1 million from Other and $2.9 million from ANGI Homeservices.\nThe Company will not be required to pay the one-time Transition Tax under the Tax Act because of its net operating loss position. The Company does not expect to be a full U.S. federal cash income tax payer until 2021, which is in line with previous estimates. We expect the Tax Act to favorably impact our future liquidity, primarily as a result of a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which will lower our effective tax rate and annual tax liability.\nAdjustments to earnings consist primarily of $275.4 million of goodwill impairment at the Publishing segment, $104.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, $79.4 million of amortization of intangibles, $71.7 million of depreciation, $17.7 million of bad debt expense, and $10.7 million of impairments on long-term investments, partially offset by $119.2 million of deferred income taxes and $51.0 million of net gains from the sale of businesses and investments. The deferred income tax benefit primarily relates to the Publishing goodwill impairment. The decrease from changes in working capital consists primarily of a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities of $52.4 million, an increase in other assets of $12.9 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $35.8 million and an increase in income taxes payable and receivable of $9.0 million. The decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities is due to (i) a decrease in accrued advertising and revenue share expense at Publishing and Applications mainly due to the effect of the new Google contract, which became effective April 1, 2016, (ii) a decrease in VAT payables related mainly to decreases in international revenue at Publishing, and (iii) decreases in payables at Match Group due to the timing of payments. The increase in other assets is primarily related to an increase in production costs at IAC Films. The increase in deferred revenue is mainly due to growth in subscription sales at Match Group, ANGI Homeservices and Vimeo. The increase in income taxes payable and receivable is primarily due to receipt of 2015 capital loss refund in 2016 and 2016 income tax accruals in excess of 2016 income tax payments, partially offset by payment of 2015 tax liabilities in 2016.\n \u2022 The ANGI Homeservices increase was due primarily to higher online and offline marketing of $78.2 million, of which $5.3 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, an increase of $64.9 million in compensation, of which $24.4 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, and $9.5 million of expense from acquisitions made prior to the Combination. The increase in marketing is due primarily to increased organic investment including television spend. Compensation increased due primarily to an increase of $24.9 million in stock-based compensation expense, of which $9.8 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, an increase in the sales force and the inclusion of $7.4 million in severance and retention costs related to the Combination. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due \nCost of revenue\nIn summary, the Company's cash flows are as follows: \nVideo Adjusted EBITDA loss improved 45% due primarily to reduced losses at Vimeo and Daily Burn and increased profits at Electus.\n \u2022 The Video increase was due primarily to a net increase in production costs at our media and video businesses and an increase in hosting fees related to Vimeo's subscription growth, increased video plays and expanded On Demand catalog. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in investment in content costs at Vimeo in 2016. \n \u2022 The Applications decrease was due primarily to a decrease of $4.4 million in compensation due, in part, to a decrease in headcount related to a reduction in workforce that took place in the first half of 2016.  Depreciation\n________________________\nIn July 2017, Tinder, Inc. ( Tinder\u201d) was merged into Match Group and as a result, all Tinder denominated equity awards were converted into Match Group tandem stock options (\"Tandem Awards\"). All of the Tandem Awards exercised during 2017 were exercised on a net basis and settled in IAC common shares. Assuming all vested and unvested Match Group Tandem Awards outstanding on December 31, 2017 were exercised on a net basis on that date and settled using IAC stock, 0.8 million IAC common shares would have been issued in settlement. Match Group would have remitted $102.4 million in cash in withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate) on behalf of the employees and issued 3.3 million of its common shares to IAC as reimbursement.\nOther expense, net in 2017 includes $16.8 million in net foreign currency exchange losses due primarily to the weakening of the dollar relative to the British Pound, expense of $15.4 million related to the extinguishment of the Match Group 6.75% Senior Notes and repricing of the Match Group Term Loan, expense of $13.0 million related to a mark-to-market adjustment pertaining to a subsidiary denominated equity award held by a non-employee, $12.2 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain investments and expense of $1.2 million related to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the 4.875% Senior Notes, partially offset by $34.9 million in gains related to the sales of certain investments and interest income of $11.4 million.\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2015 primarily represented the proportionate share of the noncontrolling holders' ownership in certain subsidiaries within the Video, ANGI Homeservices and Publishing segments and Match Group.\nThe fair value of the Company's reporting units is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows (\"DCF\") and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of October 1 each year. The Company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its subsidiary denominated stock based compensation plans, which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative screen. Determining fair value using a DCF analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed based on the reporting units' current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rates used in determining the fair value of the Company's reporting units ranged from 12.5% to 17.5% in 2017 and 10% to 17.5% in 2016. Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors. While a primary driver in the determination of the fair values of the Company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability, the determination of fair value is based, in part, upon the Company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.\n \u2022 Pairs (also known as Eureka) on April 24, 2015 (reflected in the Match Group segment). \n (ii) acquisitions in 2016 and 2015: \nWhile the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying values, the Company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 1. In 2017, the Company did not quantitatively assess the Angie's List indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired through the Combination given the proximity of the September 29, 2017 transaction date to the October 1, 2017 annual test date. The Company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks. Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 11% to 16% in both 2017 and 2016, and the royalty rates used ranged from 2% to 7% in both 2017 and 2016.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nIn connection with certain business combinations, the Company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price. Each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled. The contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics. The Company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, are recognized in General and administrative expense\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nOperating income in 2016 decreased to a loss from 2015 despite an increase of $15.4 million in Adjusted EBITDA described below, due primarily to increases of $261.3 million in goodwill impairment charges, $9.5 million in depreciation and a change of $18.0 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, partially offset by a decrease of $60.5 million in amortization of intangibles. The increase in goodwill impairment charges was due to the write-off of goodwill of $275.4 million at Publishing in 2016 compared to the write-off of goodwill of $14.1 million at ShoeBuy in 2015. The goodwill impairment charge at Publishing was driven by the impact from the new Google contract, which was effective April 1, 2016, traffic trends and monetization challenges and the corresponding impact on the then estimated fair value. The Publishing goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the second quarter of 2016. The change in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments was primarily the result of expense in 2016 of $2.6 million versus income of $15.5 million in 2015. The decrease in amortization of intangibles was due primarily to a reduction in impairment charges during 2016, partially offset by $23.3 million in amortization related to a change in classification of a Publishing trade name from an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a definite-lived intangible asset, effective April 1, 2016. The Company recorded an impairment charge in 2016 of $11.6 million compared to an impairment charge in 2015 of $88.0 million all related to certain Publishing indefinite-lived trade names.\nRevenue\nproceeds from the issuance of Match Group debt and $39.4 million and $25.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of Match Group and IAC common stock, respectively, pursuant to stock-based awards.\nFor a reconciliation of operating income (loss) for the Company's reportable segments and net (loss) earnings attributable to IAC's shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA, see \"Note 14-Segment Information\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nNet cash provided by investing activities includes net proceeds from sale of businesses and investments of $185.8 million, which is primarily related to the sale of The Princeton Review and a Match Group cost method investment, and proceeds (net of purchases) of marketable debt securities of $84.5 million, partially offset by acquisitions and purchases of investments of $158.2 million, which includes Livestream, MyBuilder, Angie's List and HomeStars acquisitions, and capital expenditures of $75.5 million, primarily related to investments in development of capitalized software at Match Group and ANGI Homeservices to support their products and services, computer hardware and the Company's purchase of a 50% ownership interest in an aircraft as a replacement for an existing 50% interest in a previously owned aircraft, which was sold on February 13, 2018.\n \u2022 ANGI Homeservices' October 1, 2017 market capitalization of $5.9 billion exceeded its carrying value by more than 450% and ANGI Homeservices' strong operating performance. \n \u2022 The Video increase was due primarily to an increase in production costs at IAC Films related to the sales of The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) and The Legacy of a Whitetail Deer Hunter and the release of Lady Bird in the current year period, the contribution from Livestream, which was acquired on October 18, 2017, and an increase of $2.6 million in hosting fees at Vimeo due to subscription growth, partially offset by lower production costs at Electus. \nIncome tax benefit (provision)\n \u2022 Exchangeable Notes - On October 2, 2017, a finance subsidiary of the Company issued $517.5 million aggregate principal of 0.875% Exchangeable Senior Notes due October 1, 2022, which notes are guaranteed by the Company and are exchangeable into shares of the Company's common stock. A portion of the proceeds were used to repay the outstanding balance of the 4.875% Senior Notes (described below). Interest is payable each April 1 and October 1, which commences on April 1, 2018. The outstanding balance of the Exchangeable Notes as of December 31, 2017 is $517.5 million. Each $1,000 of principal of the Exchangeable Notes is exchangeable for 6.5713 shares of the Company's common stock, which is equivalent to an exchange price of approximately $152.18 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. \nIn 2015, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $29.5 million, which represented an effective income tax rate of 21%. The effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the realization of certain deferred tax assets, foreign income taxed at lower rates, the non-taxable gain on contingent consideration fair value adjustments, and a reduction in tax reserves and related interest due to the expiration of statutes of limitations, partially offset by a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and unbenefited losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries.\n \u2022 4.75% Senior Notes - IAC's 4.75% Senior Notes due December 15, 2022, with interest payable each June 15 and December 15, a portion of which were exchanged for the Match Group 6.75% Senior Notes (described below) on November 16, 2015. The outstanding balance of the 4.75% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2017 is $34.9 million. \n (iii) costs of $4.9 million and $16.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the consolidation and streamlining of technology systems and European operations at the Match Group segment. This project was complete as of December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 Selling and marketing expense - consists primarily of advertising expenditures, which include online marketing, including fees paid to search engines, social media sites and third parties that distribute our Consumer downloadable desktop applications, offline marketing, which is primarily television advertising, and partner-related payments to those who direct traffic to the Match Group and ANGI Homeservices brands, and compensation (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in selling and marketing and sales support. \n \u2022 The Publishing decrease was due primarily to a reduction of $26.6 million in online marketing, principally related to lower Ask & Other revenue resulting from changes in the Google contract, and a decrease of $8.0 million in compensation due, in part, to reductions in workforce that occurred in 2016 including $3.1 million in restructuring costs in 2016. \n \u2022 Average Subscribers - is the number of Subscribers at the end of each day in the relevant measurement period divided by the number of calendar days in that period. \nInterest expense\n \u2022 Match Group - is the world's leading provider of dating products, operating a portfolio of brands, including Tinder, Match, PlentyOfFish and OkCupid. \nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. In performing its annual assessment, the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.\n \u2022 International - consists of the financial results and metrics associated with users located outside of the United States and Canada. \n \u2022 The ANGI Homeservices increase was due primarily to higher compensation of $130.7 million, of which $38.4 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, and $24.3 million in costs related to the Combination including transaction related costs of $14.3 million and integration related costs of $10.0 million. The increase in compensation was due primarily to an increase of $100.5 million in stock-based compensation expense, of which $18.0 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, an increase in headcount from business growth and the inclusion of $11.8 million in severance and retention costs in 2017 related to the Combination. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due principally to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor vested and unvested equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards, the expense related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards and the acceleration of certain Angie's List equity awards resulting from the termination of employees in connection with the Combination as well as a modification charge related to a HomeAdvisor equity award in 2017. General and administrative expense also includes increases of $9.2 million in bad debt expense due, in part, to higher Marketplace Revenue, $3.9 million in outsourced customer service expense and $3.2 million in software license and maintenance costs, as well as $9.8 million of expense from acquisitions made prior to the Combination. \nOn September 29, 2017, the Company's HomeAdvisor segment and Angie's List, Inc. (\"Angie's List\") combined under a new publicly traded company called ANGI Homeservices Inc. (the \"Combination\"). At December 31, 2017, IAC owned 86.9% and 98.5% of the economic and voting interest, respectively, of ANGI Homeservices. See \"Note 4-Business Combination\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information related to the Combination. In connection with the Combination, the Company changed the name of its HomeAdvisor segment to ANGI Homeservices and year-over-year comparisons for financial results for this segment are to the historical results of the HomeAdvisor segment (adjusted to reflect corporate allocations from IAC). During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $44.1 million in costs related to this transaction (including severance, retention, transaction and integration related costs) as well as deferred revenue write-offs of $7.8 million. The Company expects the remaining aggregate amount of transaction-related expenses, including deferred revenue write-offs, during 2018 to be in the range of $10 million to $20 million. The Company also incurred $122.1 million in stock-based compensation expense during 2017 related to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor vested and unvested equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards, the expense related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards and the acceleration of certain Angie's List equity awards resulting from the termination of employees in connection with the Combination. Stock-based compensation expense arising from the Combination is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2018.\n\n \u2022 Match Group 5.00% Senior Notes - Match Group's 5.00% Senior Notes due December 15, 2027, with interest payable each June 15 and December 15, which commences on June 15, 2018. The proceeds, along with cash on hand, were used to redeem the outstanding balance of the Match Group 6.75% Senior Notes. The outstanding balance of the Match Group 5.00% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2017 is $450 million. \nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see \"Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nThe Company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed. Marketable securities are adjusted to fair value each\nProduct development expense in 2016 increased from 2015 due to increases of $14.1 million from Match Group, $3.8 million from ANGI Homeservices, $3.3 million from Video and $2.3 million from Publishing, partially offset by a decrease of $6.6 million from Applications.\nPublishing revenue decreased 41% due to 54% lower Ask & Other revenue and 25% lower Premium Brands revenue. Ask & Other revenue decreased due to a decline in revenue at Ask Media Group primarily as a result of the new Google contract, which became effective April 1, 2016, as well as declines from certain other legacy businesses. Premium Brands revenue decreased due primarily to declines in monetization, mainly attributable to the new Google contract and organic traffic at Dotdash, partially offset by strong growth at Investopedia and The Daily Beast.\nIn 2016, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $64.9 million, which represented an effective income tax rate of 80%. The effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to foreign income taxed at lower rates and the non-taxable gain on the sale of ShoeBuy, partially offset by the non-deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge at the Publishing segment.\n \u2022 The ANGI Homeservices increase was due primarily to an increase of $23.0 million in compensation, of which $6.8 million was from the inclusion of Angie's List, and $2.9 million of expense from acquisitions made prior to the Combination. The increase in compensation was due principally to an increase of $14.5 million in stock-based compensation expense due to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor vested and unvested equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards in connection with the Combination and increased headcount. \nPublishing Adjusted EBITDA declined to a loss in 2016 due primarily to lower revenue and $15.6 million in restructuring charges related to vacating a data center and severance costs during 2016 in an effort to reduce costs in light of significant declines in revenue from the new Google contract ($9.2 million in cost of revenue, $3.1 million in selling and marketing expense, $2.3 million in general and administrative expense and $1.2 million in product development expense). Adjusted EBITDA was further impacted by decreases in selling and marketing expense, cost of revenue and general and administrative expense exclusive of the restructuring charges.\n* The Other segment consists of the results of PriceRunner, ShoeBuy and The Princeton Review for periods prior to the sales of these businesses, which occurred on March 18, 2016, December 30, 2016 and March 31, 2017, respectively. Beginning in the second quarter of 2017, as a result of the sales of these businesses, the Other segment does not include any financial results.\n (iv) restructuring charges in 2016 of $15.6 million and $2.6 million at the Publishing and Applications segments, respectively, to reduce costs in light of significant declines in revenue from the new Google contract, which was effective April 1, 2016, as well as declines from certain other legacy businesses. \nIAC has a $300 million revolving credit facility that expires on October 7, 2020. Match Group has a $500 million revolving credit facility that expires on October 7, 2020. At December 31, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under the IAC Credit Facility or the Match Group Credit Facility.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\n \u2022 The Other decrease was due to the sales of ShoeBuy and The Princeton Review.  For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015\nInterest expense in 2016 increased from 2015 due to the $800 million of borrowings under the Match Group Term Loan in November 2015, of which $400 million was refinanced on June 1, 2016 with the Match Group 6.375% Senior Notes, and the 2% higher interest rate associated with the Match Group 6.75% Senior Notes which were issued in exchange for a substantially like amount of 4.75% Senior Notes, partially offset by lower interest expense due to repurchases and redemptions of the 4.875% and 4.75% Senior Notes during the year.\nThe following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of IAC's accounting policies contained in \"Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in regard to significant areas of judgment. Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others. What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.\n_________________________________________________________________________\n \u2022 Match Exchange Offer - Match Group exchanged $445 million of Match Group 6.75% Senior Notes for a substantially like amount of 4.75% Senior Notes on November 16, 2015. \nthat these lives may be changed. The carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $519.8 million and $341.1 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nLong-term debt:\n \u2022 Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") - is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Principles of Financial Reporting\" for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA. \nApplications revenue decreased 21% due to a 39% decline in Partnerships and a 12% decline in Consumer. Partnerships revenue decreased due primarily to the loss of certain partners. The Consumer decline was driven by lower search revenue from our downloadable desktop applications due primarily to lower monetization, partially offset by strong growth at Apalon and SlimWare, which together comprised 12% of total Applications revenue in 2016.\nNet cash provided by financing activities includes $788.0 million in borrowings from the Match Group Term Loan, $428.8 million in net proceeds received from Match Group's initial public offering and $27.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of IAC common stock pursuant to stock-based awards, partially offset by $200.0 million used for the repurchase of 3.0 million shares of common stock at an average price of $67.68 per share, $113.2 million related to the payment of cash dividends to IAC shareholders, $80.0 million for the early redemption of the Liberty Bonds, $65.7 million for the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of IAC employees on net settled stock-based awards, $32.2 million for the purchase of noncontrolling interests, $23.4 million for the purchase of certain fully vested stock-based awards and $19.1 million of debt issuance costs primarily associated with the Match Group Term Loan and revolving credit facility.\n \u2022 The Corporate decrease was due primarily to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense resulting from the inclusion in 2015 of a modification charge and a greater number of awards being forfeited in 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by the issuance of new equity awards in 2016.  Product development expense\nCombination and Acquisitions\n\n\nOther revenue decreased 4% due to the sale of PriceRunner on March 18, 2016 and a 6% decrease in revenue at The Princeton Review, partially offset by growth at ShoeBuy. The decrease in revenue at The Princeton Review was primarily due to fewer in-person SAT test preparation courses and in-person tutoring sessions, partially offset by an increase in online and self-paced services.\n \u2022 The ANGI Homeservices increase was due primarily to an increase of $2.5 million in compensation and other employee-related costs due primarily to an increase in headcount. \n \u2022 The Match Group increase was due primarily to an increase of $7.5 million in compensation, an increase of $4.0 million in rent due to growth in the business and a decrease in income of $1.9 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments. The increase in compensation was due to an increase in headcount from both acquisitions and existing business growth, partially offset by a decrease of $2.1 million in stock-based compensation expense due primarily to the inclusion in 2015 of a modification charge related to certain equity awards, partially offset by the issuance of new equity awards since 2015. \nCorporate Adjusted EBITDA loss was essentially flat compared to 2015.\nPublishing revenue decreased 11% due to $58.8 million, or 20%, lower Ask & Other revenue, partially offset by $13.3 million, or 12%, higher Premium Brands revenue. Ask & Other revenue decreased due to declines in paid traffic primarily as a result of the Google contract. Premium Brands revenue increase was due to growth at Investopedia and Dotdash due to an increase in organic traffic and advertising revenue.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nFINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nDepreciation in 2016 increased from 2015 due primarily to acquisitions and capital expenditures, partially offset by certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated.\nFor the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2017, a qualitative assessment of the Match Group, ANGI Homeservices, Vimeo and Applications reporting units' goodwill was performed because the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values. The primary factors that the Company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units are described below:\nIn connection with the management of our businesses, we identify, measure and assess a variety of operating metrics. The principal metrics we use in managing our businesses are set forth below:\nANGI Homeservices Adjusted EBITDA increased 174% due primarily to higher revenue, partially offset by an increased investment in online and offline marketing and $2.1 million in transaction-related costs. Adjusted EBITDA was further impacted by higher compensation due primarily to increased headcount and an increase in bad debt expense due to higher Marketplace Revenue.\nMatch Group\nFor further details of income tax matters, see \"Note 3-Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8 - Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\n \u2022 Vimeo ending subscribers - are the number of subscribers to Vimeo's SaaS video tools at the end of the period.  Operating costs and expenses:\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents as well as cash flows generated from operations. IAC's consolidated cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 were $1.6 billion, of which $272.6 million was held by Match Group and $221.5 million was held by ANGI Homeservices. The Company generated $416.7 million of operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2017, of which $321.1 million was generated by Match Group and $41.8 million was generated by ANGI Homeservices. Each of Match Group and ANGI Homeservices is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and board of directors and has no obligation to provide the Company with funds. As a result, we cannot freely access the cash of Match Group and ANGI Homeservices and their respective subsidiaries. In addition, agreements governing Match Group's indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or distributions in the event a default has occurred or Match Group's leverage ratio (as defined in the Match Group Indentures) exceeds 5.0 to 1.0. In addition, the agreement governing ANGI Homeservices' Term Loan limits the payment of dividends or distributions in the event a default has occurred or ANGI Homeservices' leverage ratio (as defined in the Term Loan facility) exceeds 4.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2017, there are no restrictions on Match Group's or ANGI Homeservices' ability to pay dividends under these debt agreements.\n \u2022 ANGI Homeservices - is the world's largest digital marketplace for home services, connecting millions of homeowners across the globe with home service professionals, and operates leading brands in eight countries, including HomeAdvisor and Angie's List. \nprimarily to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor vested and unvested equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards, the expense related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards and the acceleration of certain Angie's List equity awards resulting from the termination of employees in connection with the Combination.\n \u2022 Video - consists of Vimeo, Electus, IAC Films and Daily Burn. \nVideo Adjusted EBITDA loss increased 43%, despite higher revenue, due to declines at Electus and higher losses from Vimeo (including the impact of deferred revenue write-offs of $2.1 million related to acquisition of Livestream), partially offset by the contribution from IAC Films and reduced losses at Daily Burn. The increased Adjusted EBITDA loss at Vimeo, despite higher revenue, reflects our investments in marketing and product development to grow the business.\n \u2022 The Publishing decrease was due primarily to reductions of $40.0 million in traffic acquisition costs and $4.6 million in content costs driven by a decline in revenue at Ask & Other, partially offset by $9.2 million in restructuring charges in 2016 related to vacating a data center facility and severance costs in connection with a reduction in workforce. \n (i) the sale of ASKfm on June 30, 2016 (reflected in the Publishing segment) \n \u2022 The Applications increase was due primarily to a change of $13.8 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, which was due to expense of $12.0 million in 2016 versus income of $1.8 million in 2015, partially offset by a decrease in compensation due, in part, to a decrease in headcount related to a reduction in workforce that took place in the first half of 2016. \nDuring 2017, the Company repurchased 0.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of $69.73 per share, or $50.1 million in aggregate.\n \u2022 The Other decrease was due primarily to the sales of The Princeton Review and ShoeBuy. \nNet (earnings) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\nApplications Adjusted EBITDA increased 3%, despite a 4% decrease in revenue, due primarily to lower operating costs. Adjusted EBITDA in 2016 includes $2.6 million in restructuring costs.\nStock-Based Compensation\n \u2022 General and administrative expense - consists primarily of compensation (including stock-based compensation expense) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in executive management, finance, legal, tax, human resources, and customer service functions (except for Match Group which includes customer service costs within cost of revenue), fees for professional services, facilities costs, bad debt expense, software license and maintenance costs and acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments (described below). \nThe Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $264.6 million, $104.8 million and $105.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Included in stock-based compensation expense in 2017 is $122.1 million related to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor vested and unvested equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards, the expense related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards and the acceleration of certain Angie's List equity awards resulting from the termination of employees in connection with the Combination. The Company estimated the fair value of stock options issued (including those modified in connection with the Combination) in 2017, 2016 and 2015 using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and, for those with a market condition, a lattice model. For stock options, including subsidiary denominated equity, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date at fair value and expensed over the vesting term. The impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one-year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $5.3 million, $20.3 million and $8.5 million, respectively. The Company also issues RSUs and performance-based RSUs. For RSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying IAC common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term. For performance-based RSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying IAC common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.\nWe market and offer our services and products to consumers through branded websites, allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner.
