In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from any results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere herein.\nThe terms FLEX,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d mean Prospect Flexible Income Fund, Inc. (formerly known as TP Flexible Income Fund, Inc.) unless the context specifically requires otherwise.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act\u201d). Our investment objective is to generate current income and, as a secondary objective, capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. We intend to meet our investment objective by primarily lending to and investing in the debt of privately-owned U.S. middle market companies, which we define as companies with annual revenue between $50 million and $2.5 billion. We have elected and intend to continue to qualify annually to be taxed for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (\"RIC\") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\").\nOn March 31, 2019, Pathway Capital Opportunity Fund, Inc. ( PWAY\u201d) merged with and into us (the Merger\u201d). As the combined surviving company, we were renamed as TP Flexible Income Fund, Inc. (we were formerly known as Triton Pacific Investment Corporation, Inc. ( TPIC\u201d)). In connection with the Merger, Prospect Flexible Income Management, LLC (the \"Adviser\"), an affiliate of PWAY, became our investment adviser, and Prospect Administration LLC (the \"Administrator\" or \"Prospect Administration\"), an affiliate of the Adviser, became our administrator. Although PWAY merged with and into us, PWAY is considered the accounting survivor of the Merger and its historical financial statements are included and discussed herein and in other applicable reports that we file with the SEC.\nOn and effective August 5, 2020, we changed our name to Prospect Flexible Income Fund, Inc. from TP Flexible Income Fund, Inc. by filing Articles of Amendment to our Fourth Articles of Amendment and Restatement, as amended and supplemented.\nWe have engaged Triton Pacific Securities, LLC (the \"Dealer Manager\") to serve as the dealer manager for our offering. The dealer manager is not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of shares but will use its best efforts to sell the shares offered.\nWe are offering for sale a maximum amount of $300,000,000 our shares of common stock on a \"best efforts\" basis. We are currently offering to sell our Class A Shares up to the maximum offering amount, at an offering price of $9.03 per Class A Share. As of August 27, 2020, we have sold a total of 2,367,478 shares of common stock, including 198,792 shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, for gross proceeds of approximately $31,652,992, including the reduction due to ($2,761,851) in shares repurchased pursuant to the Company's share repurchase program and 14,815 shares of common stock sold to Triton Pacific Adviser, LLC, our former investment adviser (the Former Adviser\u201d) in exchange for gross proceeds of $200,003. As a result of the Merger, the Company issued 775,193 shares.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the Wuhan Virus a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. As of the year ended June 30, 2020, and subsequent to June 30, 2020, the Wuhan Virus pandemic has had a significant impact on the U.S. and global economy and on us. We have experienced an increase in unrealized depreciation of our investment portfolio due to decreases in fair value of its investments attributable to the impact of the Wuhan Virus pandemic on the markets.\nThe extent of the impact of the Wuhan Virus pandemic on the financial performance of our current and future investments will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the virus, related advisories and restrictions, and the health of the financial markets and economy, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. To the extent our portfolio companies are adversely impacted by the effects of the Wuhan Virus pandemic, it may have a material adverse impact on its future net investment income, the fair value of its portfolio investments, its financial condition and the results of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies.\nOur Adviser\nOur Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company and is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Our Adviser is controlled by Prospect Capital Management, who owns a majority of its voting units. Mr. Eliasek is the principal officer of the Adviser.\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nInvestment Transactions\nWe seek to be a long-term investor with our portfolio companies. During the three months and twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we purchased investment securities (excluding short-term securities) of $1,675,000 and $23,678,340, respectively. During the same three month and twelve month period, sales and redemptions of investment securities (excluding short-term securities) were $2,286,635 and $8,271,306, respectively, resulting in a total net portfolio decline of ($611,634) for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and a total net portfolio growth of $15,407,034 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020.\nDebt Issuances and Redemptions\nDuring the three months and twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we drew an additional $0 and $15,500,000, respectively, on our Credit Facility (as defined herein) for a total of $21,000,000 outstanding on our credit facility as of June 30, 2020. See \"Credit Facility\".\nOn March 12, 2020, we made an offer to the Eligible Stockholders as part of the Special Repurchase Offer (the \"Offer\") to purchase up to 402,917.5 shares of the Company's issued and outstanding Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a price equal to the net asset value per share determined as of April 14, 2020. The Offer expired at 4:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on April 9, 2020 and a total of 52,987 shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. In accordance with the terms of the Offer, the Company purchased all of the shares validly tendered and not withdrawn at a price equal to $8.05 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $426,546.\nOn June 9, 2020, under our share repurchase program, we made an offer to purchase (the \"Tender Offer\") up to the number of shares of our issued and outstanding Class A common stock we can repurchase with the proceeds we receive from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan prior to the expiration of the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer is for cash at a price equal to the net offering price per share determined as of July 10, 2020 ( Purchase Price\u201d). The offer expired at 4:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on July 8, 2020 and a total of 65,266 shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the offer. In accordance with the terms of the offer, the Company purchased 28,786 shares validly tendered and not withdrawn at a price equal to $8.25 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $237,488.\nEquity Issuances\nAs part of the dividend reinvestment plan, we issued 7,087, 7,095 and 11,449 shares of our common stock on April 3, 2020, May 1, 2020 and June 5, 2020, respectively. On July 6, 2020 we issued 7,120 shares of our common stock in connection with the dividend reinvestment plan for June 2020 distributions.\nInvestments\nWe intend to primarily lend to and invest in the debt of privately-owned U.S. middle market companies. We may on occasion invest in smaller or larger companies if an attractive opportunity presents itself, especially when there are dislocations in the capital markets. We expect to focus primarily on making investments in syndicated senior secured first lien loans, syndicated senior secured second lien loans, and to a lesser extent, subordinated debt, of middle market companies in a broad range of industries. Syndicated secured loans refer to commercial loans provided by a group of lenders that are structured, arranged, and administered by one or several commercial or investment banks, known as arrangers. These loans are then sold (or syndicated) to other banks or institutional investors. Syndicated secured loans may have a first priority lien on a borrower's assets (i.e., senior secured first lien loans), a second priority lien on a borrower's assets (i.e., senior secured second lien loans), or a lower lien or unsecured position on the borrower's assets (i.e., subordinated debt). We expect our target credit investments will typically have initial maturities between three and ten years and generally range in size between $1 million and $100 million, although the investment size will vary with the size of our capital base. We expect that the majority of our debt investments will bear interest at floating interest rates, but our portfolio may also include fixed-rate investments. We also expect to make our investments directly through the primary issuance by the borrower or in the secondary market.\nWe will generally source our investments primarily through our Adviser. We believe the investment management team of our Adviser has a significant amount of experience in the credit business, including originating, underwriting, principal investing and loan structuring. Our Adviser, through Prospect Capital Management, has access to 95 professionals, 42 of whom perform investment advisory functions.\nWe expect to dynamically allocate our assets in varying types of investments based on our analysis of the credit markets, which may result in our portfolio becoming more concentrated in particular types of credit instruments (such as senior secured loans) and less invested in other types of credit instruments. The loans in which we intend to invest are often rated by a nationally recognized ratings organization, and generally carry a rating below investment grade (rated lower than Baa3\u201d by Moody's Investors Service or lower than BBB-\u201d by Standard & Poor's Corporation - also known as high yield\u201d or junk bonds\u201d). However, we may also invest in non-rated debt securities.\nTo seek to enhance our returns, we may employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of our Adviser, but in no event will leverage employed exceed the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act.\nAs part of our investment objective to generate current income, we expect that at least 70% of our investments will consist primarily of syndicated senior secured first lien loans, syndicated senior secured second lien loans, and to a lesser extent, subordinated debt. We expect that up to 30% of our investments will consist of other securities, including private equity (both common and preferred), dividend-paying equity, royalties, and the equity and junior debt tranches of collateralized loan obligations (\"CLOs\"), which we also refer to as subordinated structured notes (\"SSNs\"). The senior secured loans underlying our CLO investments are expected typically to be BB or B rated (non-investment grade, which are often referred to as high yield\u201d or junk\u201d) and in limited circumstances, unrated, senior secured loans.\nAs a BDC, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making our investments. For example, we have in the past and expect in the future to co-invest on a concurrent basis with certain affiliates, consistent with applicable regulations and our allocation procedures. On January 13, 2020, the parent company of the Adviser received an exemptive order from the SEC granting the ability to negotiate terms, other than price and quantity, of co-investment transactions with other funds managed by our Adviser or certain affiliates, including us, Prospect Capital Corporation and Priority Income Fund, Inc., subject to certain conditions included therein. Under the terms of the Order permitting us to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates, a majority of our independent directors who have no financial interest in the transaction must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies. The Order also imposes reporting and record keeping requirements and limitations on transactional fees. We may only co-invest with certain entities affiliated with our Adviser in negotiated transactions originated by our Adviser or its affiliates in accordance with such Order and existing regulatory guidance. See Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These co-investment transactions may give rise to conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest among us and the other participating accounts. To mitigate these conflicts, our Adviser and its affiliates will seek to allocate portfolio transactions for all of the participating investment accounts, including us, on a fair and equitable basis, taking into account such factors as the relative amounts of capital available for new investments, the applicable investment programs and portfolio positions, the clients for which participation is appropriate and any other factors deemed appropriate. We intend to make all of our investments in compliance with the 1940 Act and in a manner that will not jeopardize our status as a BDC or RIC.\nAs a BDC, we are permitted under the 1940 Act to borrow funds to finance portfolio investments. To enhance our opportunity for gain, we intend to employ leverage as market conditions permit. At the 2019 Annual Meeting, TPIC's stockholders approved a proposal allowing us to modify our asset coverage ratio requirement from 200% to 150%. As a result, we are allowed to increase our leverage capacity effective as of March 16, 2019. The use of leverage, although it may increase returns, may also increase the risk of loss to our investors, particularly if the level of our leverage is high and the value of our investments declines.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue in the form of dividends, interest and capital gains on the debt securities, equity interests and CLOs that we hold. In addition, we may generate revenue from our portfolio companies in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees and performance-based fees. Any such fees will be recognized as earned.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses will be the payment of advisory fees and other expenses under the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser (the \"Investment Advisory Agreement\"). The advisory fees will compensate our Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments.\nWe will bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>corporate and organizational expenses relating to offerings of our common stock, subject to limitations included in the investment advisory and management services agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the cost of effecting sales and repurchase of shares of our common stock and other securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>investment advisory fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>transfer agent and custodial fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>federal and state registration fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>federal, state and local taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>independent directors' fees and expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs of proxy statements, stockholders' reports and notices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>direct costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone, and staff;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>brokerage commissions for our investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>legal, accounting and other costs associated with structuring, negotiating, documenting and completing our investment transactions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>all other expenses incurred by our Adviser, in performing its obligations, subject to the limitations included in the Investment Advisory Agreement; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>all other expenses incurred by either our Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments to our Administrator under the Administration Agreement (as defined herein) that will be based upon our allocable portion of its overhead and other expenses incurred in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief executive officer, chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staffs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Reimbursement of our Administrator for Administrative Services\nWe will reimburse our Administrator for the administrative expenses necessary for its performance of services to us. Such costs will be reasonably allocated to us on the basis of assets, revenues, time records or other reasonable methods. However, such reimbursement is made in an amount equal to the lower of the Administrator's actual costs or the amount that we would be required to pay for comparable administrative services in the same geographic location. We will not reimburse our Administrator for any services for which it receives a separate fee or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of our Administrator.\nMerger\nEffective March 31, 2019, TPIC and PWAY entered into a tax free business combination. Concurrent with the Merger, TPIC, the legal acquirer, was renamed Prospect Flexible Income Fund, Inc. (formerly known as TP Flexible Income Fund, Inc.) As a result of the Merger the Company issued 775,193 shares of the Company's common stock to the former shareholders of PWAY and all shares of PWAY were retired.\nFor financial reporting purposes, the Merger was treated as a recapitalization of PWAY followed by the reverse acquisition of TPIC by PWAY for a purchase price equivalent to the fair value of TPIC's net assets.\nConsistent with tax free business combinations of investment companies, for financial reporting purposes, the reverse merger accounting was recorded at fair value; however, the cost basis of the investments received from TPIC was carried forward to align ongoing financial reporting of the Company's realized and unrealized gains and losses with amounts distributable to shareholders\nfor tax purposes. Further, the components of net assets of the Company reflect the combined components of net assets of both PWAY and TPIC.\nIn accordance with the accounting and presentation for reverse acquisitions, the historical financial statements of the Company, prior to the date of the Merger reflect the financial positions and results of operations of PWAY, with the results of operations of TPIC being included commencing on April 1, 2019. Effective with the completion of the Merger, TPIC, changed its fiscal year end to be the last day of June consistent with PWAY's fiscal year.\nIn the Merger, common shareholders of PWAY received newly-issued common shares in the Company having an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset value of their holdings of PWAY Class A and/or PWAY Class I common shares, as applicable, as determined at the close of business on March 27, 2019, as permitted by the Merger Agreement. The differences in net asset value between March 27, 2019 and March 31, 2019 were not material. Relevant details pertaining to the Merger are as follows:\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NAV/Share\n($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Conversion Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Triton Pacific Investment Corporation, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pathway Capital Opportunity Fund, Inc.: Class A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2848\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pathway Capital Opportunity Fund, Inc.: Class I\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2884\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestments\nThe cost, fair value and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of the investments of TPIC as of the date of the Merger, was as follows:\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>TPIC\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,106,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value of investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,431,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(675,638\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommon Shares\nThe common shares outstanding, net assets applicable to common shares and NAV per common share outstanding immediately before and after the Merger were as follows:\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounting Acquirer - Prior to Merger\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PWAY\nClass A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>PWAY\nClass I\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common shares outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>570,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net assets applicable to common shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,679,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>443,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAV per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal Acquiring Fund - Prior to Merger\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>TPIC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common shares outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,614,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net assets applicable to common shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,915,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAV per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal Acquiring Fund - Post Merger\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>FLEX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common shares outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,403,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net assets applicable to common shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,086,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NAV per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost and Expenses\nIn connection with the Merger, PWAY incurred certain associated costs and expenses of approximately $731,000, of which $709,000 of these costs and expenses were expensed by PWAY and $22,000 were expensed by the Company. In connection with the Merger, TPIC incurred certain associated costs and expenses of approximately $682,000, of which $636,000 were expensed by TPIC and $46,000 were expensed by the Company.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nPWAY as the accounting acquirer acquired 32% of the voting interests of TPIC.

During the same three month and twelve month period, sales and redemptions of investment securities (excluding short-term securities) were $2,286,635 and $8,271,306, respectively, resulting in a total net portfolio decline of ($611,634) for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and a total net portfolio growth of $15,407,034 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, our investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $36,663,703, consisted of interests in 54 investments (82% in senior secured loans, 2% in senior secured notes, 2% in equity/other and 14% in CLO - subordinated notes). During the three months and twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the investment activity continued to focus on repositioning the portfolio as a result of the Merger.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2020, the U.S. loan market exhibited a heightened level of volatility. While U.S. loan prices remained relatively stable throughout February 2020, the increasingly negative sentiment associated with the economic ramifications of the rapid spread of Wuhan Virus led to a precipitous decline in U.S. loan prices in the quarter ended March 31, 2020. During quarter end June 30, 2020, U.S. loan prices rebounded and as a result, our portfolio increased in value during the three months ended June 30, 2020.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, purchases of investment securities (excluding short-term securities) were $12,454,720. During the same period, sales and redemptions of investment securities (excluding short-term securities) were $9,854,278. As of June 30, 2019, our investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $24,019,563, consisted of interests in 53 investment companies (76% in senior secured bonds, 2% in senior secured notes, 2% in equity/other and 20% in CLO - subordinated notes).

For the year ended June 30, 2020, the fair value of our investments was negatively impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the Wuhan Virus pandemic and its effect on market yields and fundamental portfolio company performance. For more information, see Valuation of Portfolio Investments\u201d.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe will generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of our offering, and from cash flows from fees (such as management fees), interest and dividends earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. Our primary use of funds will be investments in companies, and payments of our expenses and distributions to holders of our common stock.\nWe believe that our current cash on hand and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations. This \"Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section should be read in conjunction with Wuhan Virus Pandemic under the \"Recent Developments\" section below.\nThe offering of our common stock represents a continuous offering of our shares. The initial offering of our common stock commenced on September 4, 2012 and terminated on March 1, 2016. On March 17, 2016, we commenced the follow-on offering of our common stock, which follow-on offering is currently ongoing. We intend to file post-effective amendments to our registration statement to allow us to continue our offering for three years. On September 26, 2019, we filed with the SEC an amendment to our registration statement, which was declared effective September 26, 2019, in order to continue our continuous public offering of our shares.\nThe Dealer Manager is not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of shares but will use its best efforts to sell the shares offered. The minimum investment in shares of our common stock is $5,000.\nOn May 14, 2020, the Company decreased its offering price from $11.38 per share to $8.78 per share. The decrease in the offering price is effective for all closings occurring on or after May 15, 2020. We will sell our shares on a continuous basis at a price of $8.78 per share. On August 12, 2020, our Board of Directors determined to change the public offering price per share of our Class A shares of common stock from $8.78 per share to $9.03 per share. The change in the public offering price will be effective as of August 12, 2020 and first applied to subscriptions in good order received on or after August 12, 2020. In addition, on August 26, 2020, the Company increased its offering price from $9.03 per share to $9.33 per share. The increase in the offering price is effective for all closings occurring on or after August 26, 2020. To the extent our net asset value increases, we will sell at a price necessary to ensure that shares are not sold at a price per share, after deduction of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, that is below our net asset value per share. In connection with each closing, our board of directors or a committee thereof is required, within 48 hours of the time that each closing and sale is made, to make the determination that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price per share which, after deducting upfront selling commissions, if any, is below the then-current net asset value per share of the applicable class. Promptly following any such adjustment to the offering price per share, we will file a prospectus supplement with the SEC disclosing the adjusted offering price, and we appropriately publish the updated information.\nWe may borrow funds to make investments at any time, including before we have fully invested the proceeds of our offering, to the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities, or if our board of directors determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. We have not yet decided, however, whether, and to what extent, we will finance portfolio investments using debt. We do not currently anticipate issuing any preferred stock.\nThe North American Securities Administrators Association, in its Omnibus Guidelines Statement of Policy adopted on March 29, 1992 and as amended on May 7, 2007 and from time to time, requires that our sponsor and its affiliates have an aggregate financial net worth, exclusive of home, automobile and home furnishings, of 5% of the first $20,000 of both the gross amount of securities currently being offered and the gross amount of any originally issued direct participation program sold by our sponsor and its affiliates within the last 12 months, plus 1% of all amounts in excess of the first $20,000. Based on these requirements, our sponsor and its affiliates have an aggregate net worth in excess of those amounts required by the Omnibus Guidelines Statement of Policy.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have entered into certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. On March 31, 2019, we entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with Prospect Flexible Income Management, LLC in accordance with the 1940 Act. The Investment Advisory Agreement became effective upon consummation of the Merger. Prospect Flexible Income Management,\nLLC serves as our investment adviser in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. Payments under the Investment Advisory Agreement in each reporting period will consist of (i) a management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our gross assets and (ii) income and capital gains incentive fees based on our performance.\nOn March 31, 2019, we entered into the Administration Agreement with Prospect Administration, which was amended and restated effective as of June 17, 2019, pursuant to which Prospect Administration furnishes us with administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. The Administration Agreement with Prospect Administration initially became effective upon consummation of the Merger. We reimburse Prospect Administration for its allocable portion of overhead incurred by Prospect Administration in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and its allocable portion of the costs of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and her staff. We have engaged Bank of New York Mellon and affiliated entities to act as our custodian. We have also contracted with Phoenix American Financial Services to act as our transfer agent, plan administrator, distribution paying agent and registrar.\nIf any of our contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs may increase under any new agreements that we enter into as replacements. We would also likely incur expenses in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. Any new investment advisory agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities.\nCredit Facility\nOn May 16, 2019, we established a $50 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) with Royal Bank of Canada, a Canadian chartered bank ( RBC\u201d), acting as administrative agent. In connection with the credit facility, our wholly owned financing subsidiary, Prospect Flexible Funding, LLC (the \"SPV\"), as borrower, and each of the other parties thereto, entered into a Revolving Loan Agreement, dated as of May 16, 2019 (the Loan Agreement\u201d). The SPV is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that was formed to facilitate the transactions under the Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the SPV holds certain of the securities that would otherwise be owned by the Company to be used as the borrowing base and collateral under the Credit Facility. Income paid on these investments is distributed to the Company pursuant to a waterfall after taxes, fees, expenses, and debt service. The lenders under the Credit Facility have a security interest in the investments held by the SPV. Although these investments are owned by the SPV, because the SPV is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, the Company is subject to all of the benefits and risks associated with the Credit Facility and the investments held by the SPV.\nThe Credit Facility matures on May 21, 2029 and generally bears an interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.55%. On May 11, 2020, the Company agreed to the increased interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.20% on the Credit Facility for the period between May 16, 2020 to November 15, 2020. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the SPV's properties and assets. Under the Loan Agreement, the SPV has made certain customary representations and warranties and is required to comply with various covenants, including reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The Loan Agreement includes usual and customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature.\nRecent Developments\nManagement has evaluated all known subsequent events through the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements were available to be issued on August 27, 2020 and notes the following:\nName Change\nEffective August 5, 2020, we amended our articles of incorporation to change our name to Prospect Flexible Income Fund, Inc. In addition, on August 5, 2020, we amended and restated our bylaws to reflect the change of our corporate name.\nDealer Manager Agreement\nOn August 6, 2020, we amended our dealer manager agreement with our dealer manager to reflect a change to the upfront sales load paid to our dealer manager in connection with the sale of our Class A Shares. Under the amended dealer manager agreement, we will pay our dealer manager an upfront sales load of up to 9% of the gross proceeds received on Class A Shares sold in our offering all or a portion of which may be paid to selected broker-dealers and financial representatives. The upfront sales load consists of upfront selling commissions of up to 6.0% of the gross proceeds of Class A Shares sold in our offering and a dealer\nmanager fee of up to 3.0% of the gross offering proceeds of Class A Shares sold in our offering. The amended dealer manager agreement became effective on August 26, 2020.\nLicense Agreement\nOn August 4, 2020, we entered into a license agreement with an affiliate of our Adviser, pursuant to which the affiliate granted us a non-exclusive, royalty free license to use the Prospect\u201d name. Under this license agreement, we have the right to use such name for so long as our Adviser or another affiliate of Prospect Capital Management is our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the Prospect\u201d name or logo.\nSales of Common Stock\nFor the period beginning July 1, 2020 and ending August 27, 2020, the Company sold 17,295 shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of $156,000 and issued 15,959 shares pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan in the amount of $131,658.\nInvestment Activity\nDuring the period beginning July 1, 2020 and ending August 27, 2020, the Company made 2 investments totaling $1,189,063. During the period beginning July 1, 2020 and ending August 27, 2020, the Company sold 1 investment totaling $446,250.\nOn August 14, 2020, the Company funded $45,455 of the total $85,227 delayed draw term loan commitment for our investment in Amerilife Holdings, LLC portfolio company.\nOffering Price\nOn August 12, 2020, the Company increased its offering price from $8.78 per share to $9.03 per share. The increase in the offering price is effective for all closings occurring on or after August 12, 2020. In addition, on August 26, 2020, the Company increased its offering price from $9.03 per share to $9.33 per share. The increase in the offering price is effective for all closings occurring on or after August 26, 2020.\nRepurchase Offer\nOn June 9, 2020, under our share repurchase program, we made an offer to purchase (the \"Tender Offer\") up to the number of shares of our issued and outstanding Class A common stock we can repurchase with the proceeds we receive from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan prior to the expiration of the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer is for cash at a price equal to the net offering price per share determined as of July 10, 2020 ( Purchase Price\u201d). The offer expired at 4:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on July 8, 2020 and a total of 65,266 shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the offer. In accordance with the terms of the offer, the Company purchased 28,786 shares validly tendered and not withdrawn at a price equal to $8.25 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $237,488.\nDistributions\nGeneral\nWe elected to be treated, beginning with our fiscal year ending December 31, 2012, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under the Code. To maintain RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute at least 90% of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: (i) 98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of our recognized capital gains in excess of recognized capital losses for the one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any ordinary income or capital gains recognized but not distributed in preceding years and on which we paid no federal income tax.\nWhile we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of the tax. In that event, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.\nOur board of directors has authorized, and has declared, cash distributions on our common stock on a monthly basis since the second quarter of 2015 (in our capacity as TPIC). The amount of each such distribution is subject to our board of directors' discretion and applicable legal restrictions related to the payment of distributions. We calculate each stockholder's specific distribution amount for the month using record and declaration dates, and distributions will begin to accrue on the date we accept subscriptions for shares of our common stock. From time to time, we may also pay interim distributions at the discretion of our board of directors. Each year a statement on Internal Revenue Service Form 1099-DIV (or any successor form) identifying the source of the distribution (i.e.,(i) paid from investment company taxable income, which is generally our net ordinary income plus our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital gains, (ii) paid from net capital gain on the sale\nof securities, which is our realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net-short term capital losses, and/or (iii) a return of paid-in capital surplus, which is generally a nontaxable distribution) will be mailed to our stockholders. Our distributions may exceed our earnings, especially during the period before we have substantially invested the proceeds from our offering. As a result, a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital for tax purposes.\nWe have adopted an opt in\u201d distribution reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, when we make a distribution, stockholders will receive distributions in cash unless they specifically opt in\u201d to the distribution reinvestment plan so as to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to U.S. stockholders.\nRelated Party Transactions\nLicense Agreement\nWe entered into a license agreement with an affiliate of our Adviser, pursuant to which the affiliate granted us a non-exclusive, royalty free license to use the Prospect\u201d name. Under this license agreement, we have the right to use such name for so long as our Adviser or another affiliate of Prospect Capital Management is our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the Prospect\u201d name or logo.\nInvestment Advisory Agreement\nWe have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with our Adviser. We will pay our Adviser a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components - a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee payable to the Adviser and any incentive fees it earns will ultimately be borne by our stockholders. See -Investment Advisory Fees.\u201d\nCertain members of our senior management hold an equity interest in our Adviser. Members of our senior management also serve as principals of other investment managers affiliated with our Adviser that do and may in the future manage investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles with investment objectives similar to ours.\nAdministration Agreement\nOn September 2, 2014, PWAY entered into an administration agreement with Prospect Administration LLC, an affiliate of the Adviser and in which certain members of our senior management hold an equity interest and act as principals. Pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger as amended and restated, between TPIC and PWAY, Prospect Administration LLC became the administrator for the Company pursuant to an administrative agreement, as amended and restated as of June 17, 2019 (the \"Administration Agreement\"). The Administrator performs, oversees and arranges for the performance of administrative services necessary for the operation of the Company. These services include, but are not limited to, accounting, finance and legal services. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, the Company reimburses the Administrator for the Company's actual and allocable portion of expenses and overhead incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the Company's allocable portion of the costs of its Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and her staff. For the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 administrative costs incurred by the Company and PWAY to the Administrator were $596,030, $442,047 and $357,995, respectively. As of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, $122,384 and $341,235, respectively, was payable to the Administrator by the Company.\nAllocation of Expenses\nThe cost of valuation services for CLOs is initially borne by Priority Income Fund, Inc. (\"PRIS\"), which then allocates to the Company its proportional share of such expense. During the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, PRIS incurred $77,212, $61,311 and $60,004, respectively, in expenses related to valuation services that are attributable to the Company. The Company reimburses PRIS for these expenses and includes them as part of valuation services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, $13,516 and $32,314, respectively, of expense is due to PRIS, which is presented as part of due to affiliates on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nThe cost of filing software is initially borne by PSEC, which then allocates to the Company its proportional share of such expense. During the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, PSEC incurred $9,065, $9,390 and $10,162, respectively in expenses related to the filing services that are attributable to the Company. The Company reimburses PSEC for these expenses and includes them as part of general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, $0 and $2,348 was due to PSEC, respectively.\nThe cost of portfolio management software is initially borne by the Company, which then allocates to PSEC its proportional share of such expense. During the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred $0, $11,058 and $23,603, respectively, in expenses related to the portfolio management software that is attributable to PSEC. PSEC reimburses the Company for these expenses and included them as part of general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, $0 of expense is due from PSEC.\nOfficers and Directors\nCertain officers and directors of the Company are also officers and directors of the Adviser and its affiliates. There were no fees paid to the independent directors of the Company as the Company did not exceed the minimum net asset value required (i.e., greater than $100 million) to receive a fee for the year ended June 30, 2020. The officers do not receive any direct compensation from the Company.\nDealer Manager Agreement\nThe Company and its Adviser have entered into a dealer manager agreement with Triton Pacific Securities, LLC pursuant to which the Company will pay the Dealer Manager a fee of up to 9.0% of gross proceeds raised in the Company's offering, some of which will be re-allowed to other participating broker-dealers. In addition to the upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees, the Adviser may pay the Dealer Manager a fee (the \"Additional Selling Commissions\") equal to no more than 1.0% of the net asset value per share per year. The Dealer Manager will reallow all or a portion of the Additional Selling Commissions to participating broker-dealers. The Dealer Manager is an affiliated entity of the Former Adviser and is partially owned by one of our directors, Craig Faggen.\nExpense Limitation Agreement\nThe Company has entered into an expense limitation agreement with the Adviser pursuant to which the Adviser, in its sole discretion,\nmay waive a portion or all of the investment advisory fees that it is entitled to receive under the Investment Advisory Agreement\nin order to limit the Company's operating expenses to an annual rate, expressed as a percentage of the Company's average quarterly\nnet assets, equal to 8.00%. See Expense Limitation Agreement\u201d below.\nExpense Limitation Agreement\nExpense Reimbursement Agreement with our Former Adviser\nOn March 27, 2014, we and our Former Adviser entered into an Expense Reimbursement Agreement. The Expense Reimbursement Agreement was amended and restated effective April 5, 2018. Under the Expense Reimbursement Agreement, as amended, our Former Adviser, in consultation with the Company, could pay up to 100% of both our organizational and offering expenses and our operating expenses, all as determined by us and our Former Adviser. The Expense Reimbursement Agreement stated that until the net proceeds to us from our offering are at least $25 million, our Former Adviser could pay up to 100% of both our organizational and offering expenses and our operating expenses. After we received at least $25 million in net proceeds from our offering, our Former Adviser could, with our consent, continue to make expense support payments to us in such amounts as was acceptable to us and our Former Adviser. The Expense Reimbursement Agreement terminated on December 31, 2018. Our Former Adviser had agreed to reimburse a total of $5,292,192 as of December 31, 2018. However, as part of the Merger, the Former Adviser agreed to waive any amounts owed to it under the Expense Reimbursement Agreement.\nExpense Limitation Agreement with the Adviser\nConcurrently with the closing of the Merger, we entered into an Expense Limitation Agreement with our Adviser (the ELA\u201d). Pursuant to the ELA, our Adviser, in its sole discretion, may waive a portion or all of the investment advisory fees that it is entitled to receive pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement in order to limit our Operating Expenses (as defined below) to an annual rate, expressed as a percentage of our average quarterly net assets, equal to 8.00% (the Annual Limit\u201d). For purposes of the ELA, the term Operating Expenses\u201d with respect to the Company, is defined to include all expenses necessary or appropriate for the operation of the Company, including but not limited to our Adviser's base management fee, any and all costs and expenses that qualify as line item organization and offering\u201d expenses in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as the same are filed with the SEC and other expenses described in the Investment Advisory Agreement, but does not include any portfolio transaction or other investment-related costs (including brokerage commissions, dealer and underwriter spreads, prime broker fees and expenses and dividend expenses related to short sales), interest expenses and other financing costs, extraordinary expenses and acquired fund fees and expenses. Upfront shareholder transaction expenses (such as sales commissions, dealer manager fees, and similar expenses) are not Operating Expenses. On April 30, 2020, the Company's board of directors approved extending the Expense Limitation Agreement for an additional 12-month term ending on April 30, 2021\nAny amount waived pursuant to the ELA is subject to repayment to our Adviser (an ELA Reimbursement\u201d) by us within the three years following the end of the quarter in which the waiver was made by our Adviser. If the ELA is terminated or expires pursuant to its terms, our Adviser maintains its right to repayment for any waiver it has made under the ELA, subject to the Repayment Limitations (discussed below).\nAny ELA Reimbursement can be made solely in the event that we have sufficient excess cash on hand at the time of any proposed ELA Reimbursement and shall be limited to the lesser of (i) the excess of the Annual Limit applicable to such quarter over the Company's actual Operating Expenses for such quarter and (ii) the amount of ELA Reimbursement which, when added to the Company's expenses for such quarter, permits the Company to pay the then-current aggregate quarterly distribution to its shareholders, at a minimum annualized rate of at least 6.00% (based on the gross offering prices of Company shares) (the Distribution\u201d) from the sum of (x) the Company's net investment income (loss) for such quarter plus (y) the Company's net realized gains (losses) for such quarter (collectively, the Repayment Limitations\u201d). For the purposes of the calculations pursuant to (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence, any ELA Reimbursement will be treated as an expense of the Company for such quarter, without regard to the GAAP treatment of such expense. In the event that the Company is unable to make a full payment of any ELA Reimbursements due for any applicable quarter because the Company does not have sufficient excess cash on hand, any such unpaid amount shall become a payable of the Company for accounting purposes and shall be paid when the Company has sufficient cash on hand (subject to the Repayment Limitations); provided, that in the case of any ELA Reimbursements, such payment shall be made no later than the date that is three years following the end of the quarter in which the applicable waiver was made by our Adviser.\nInvestment Advisory Fees\nPursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay the Adviser a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee payable to the Adviser and any incentive fees it earns will ultimately be borne by our stockholders.\nBase Management Fee. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% (0.4375% quarterly) of our average total assets, which includes any borrowings for investment purposes. For the first quarter of our operations following the Merger, the base management fee was calculated based on the average value of our total assets as of the date of the Investment Advisory Agreement and at the end of the calendar quarter in which the date of the Investment Advisory Agreement fell, and was appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the then current calendar quarter. Subsequently, the base management fee\nis payable quarterly in arrears, and is calculated based on the average value of our total assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and is appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the then current calendar quarter. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter is appropriately pro-rated. At the Adviser's option, the base management fee for any period may be deferred, without interest thereon, and paid to the Adviser at any time subsequent to any such deferral as the Adviser determines.\nIncentive Fee. The incentive fee consists of two parts: (1) the subordinated incentive fee on income and (2) the capital gains incentive fee.\nSubordinated Incentive Fee on Income. The first part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the subordinated incentive fee on income, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based upon our pre-incentive fee net investment income\u201d for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For purposes of this fee, pre-incentive fee net investment income\u201d means interest income, dividend income and distribution cash flows from equity investments and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses reimbursed under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the organization and offering expenses and incentive fees on income and capital gains). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The subordinated incentive fee on income is subject to a quarterly fixed preferred return to investors, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, of 1.5% (6.0% annualized), subject to a catch up\u201d feature. Operating expenses are included in the calculation of the subordinated incentive fee on income.\nWe will pay our Adviser a subordinated incentive fee on income for each calendar quarter as follows:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>No incentive fee will be payable to our Adviser in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the preferred return rate of 1.5%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the preferred return but is less than or equal to 1.875% in any calendar quarter (7.5% annualized). We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the preferred return but is less than or equal to 1.875%) as the catch-up.\u201d The effect of the catch-up\u201d provision is that, if our pre-incentive fee net investment income reaches 1.875% in any calendar quarter, our Adviser will receive 20.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a preferred return did not apply.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>20.0% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 1.875% in any calendar quarter (7.5% annualized) will be payable to our Adviser. This reflects that once the preferred return is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 20.0% of all pre-incentive fee net investment income thereafter will be allocated to our Adviser.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Capital Gains Incentive Fee. The second part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the capital gains incentive fee, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20.00% of our realized capital gains for the calendar year, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation at the end of such year. In determining the capital gains incentive fee payable to the Adviser, we calculate the aggregate realized capital gains, aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, as applicable, with respect to each investment that has been in our portfolio. For the purpose of this calculation, an investment\u201d is defined as the total of all rights and claims which may be asserted against a portfolio company arising from our participation in the debt, equity, and other financial instruments issued by that company. Aggregate realized capital gains, if any, equal the sum of the differences between the aggregate net sales price of each investment and the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment when sold or otherwise disposed. Aggregate realized capital losses equal the sum of the amounts by which the aggregate net sales price of each investment is less than the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment when sold or otherwise disposed. Aggregate unrealized capital depreciation equals the sum of the differences, if negative, between the aggregate valuation of each investment and the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment as of the applicable calendar year-end. At the end of the applicable calendar year, the amount of capital gains that serves as the basis for our calculation of the capital gains incentive fee involves netting aggregate realized capital gains against aggregate realized capital losses on a since-inception basis and then reducing this amount by the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation. If this number is positive, then the capital gains incentive fee payable is equal to 20.00% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains incentive fees paid since inception. Operating expenses are not taken into account when determining capital gains incentive fees.\nAsset Coverage\nIn accordance with the 1940 Act, the Company is currently only allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage,\u201d as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 150% after such borrowing. Asset coverage\u201d generally refers to a company's total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities,\u201d as defined in the 1940 Act, divided by total senior securities representing indebtedness and, if applicable, preferred stock. Senior securities\u201d for this purpose includes borrowings from banks or other lenders, debt securities and preferred stock.\nOn March 23, 2018, an amendment to Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act was signed into law to permit BDCs to reduce the minimum asset coverage\u201d ratio from 200% to 150%, so long as certain approval and disclosure requirements are satisfied. In addition, for BDCs like the Company whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, the Company is also required to offer to repurchase its outstanding shares at the rate of 25% per quarter over four calendar quarters. Under the existing 200% minimum asset coverage ratio, the Company is permitted to borrow up to one dollar for investment purposes for every one dollar of investor equity, and under the 150% minimum asset coverage ratio, the Company will be permitted to borrow up to two dollars for investment purposes for every one dollar of investor equity. In other words, Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, as amended, permits BDCs to potentially increase their debt-to-equity ratio from a maximum of 1 to 1 to a maximum of 2 to 1.\nAt the 2019 Annual Meeting, stockholders approved the application to the Company of the 150% minimum asset coverage ratio set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, and subject to certain additional disclosure requirements and the repurchase obligations described above, the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to the Company was reduced from 200% to 150%, effective as of March 16, 2019.\nBelow is the asset coverage for the twelve month ended June 30, 2020 and the year ended June 30, 2019.\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>Total Amount Outstanding\n</td> <td>Asset Coverage per Unit(1)\n</td> <td>Involuntary Liquidating Preference per Unit(2)\n</td> <td>Average Market Value per Unit(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2020\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2020\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) The asset coverage ratio is calculated as our consolidated total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, divided by secured senior securities representing indebtedness.

Section II of the April 2020 Order (i) affords BDCs greater flexibility in calculating asset coverage ratios for purposes of the 1940 Act asset coverage requirements, (ii) requires a BDC's board of directors, including a required majority of such board, as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act, to determine that the issuance or sale of covered senior securities is permitted by this April 2020 Order and is in the best interests of the BDC and its stockholders, (iii) requires prior disclosure on Form 8-K of an election to rely on Section II of the April 2020 Order, and (iv) includes certain limitations on new investments, among other requirements detailed in the April 2020 Order. The Company has not taken advantage of the relief provided by the April 2020 Order.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q, ASC 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies ( ASC 946\u201d), and Articles 3, 6 and 12 of Regulation S-X. Under the 1940 Act, ASC 946, and the regulations pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X, we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company or an operating company which provides substantially all of its services to benefit us. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Prospect Flexible Funding, LLC. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nThe Company determines the fair value of its investment portfolio each quarter. The fair values of the Company's investments are determined in good faith by the Company's board of directors. The Company's board of directors is solely responsible for the valuation of the Company's portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the Company's valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process.\nIn connection with that determination, the Adviser provides the Company's board of directors with portfolio company valuations which are based on relevant inputs which may include indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by third-party valuation services.\nWe follow guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820\u201d), which classifies the inputs used to measure fair values into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1. Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2. Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in an inactive market, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.\nLevel 3. Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nIn all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment.\nSecurities that are publicly-traded are valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market are valued by an independent pricing agent or more than one principal market maker, if available, otherwise a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. We value over-the-counter securities by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which were provided by an independent pricing agent and screened for validity by such service. As a result of the volatility and disruption to the global economy from the Wuhan Virus pandemic (as further discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements), certain market quotations were not deemed to represent fair value.\nWhen market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, our board of directors has approved a multi-step valuation process for each quarter, as described below, and such investments are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy:\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>Each portfolio company or investment is reviewed by investment professionals of the Adviser with the independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.\n</td> <td>The independent valuation firms prepare independent valuations based on their own independent assessments and issue their reports.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.\n</td> <td>The audit committee of our board of directors (the Audit Committee\u201d) reviews and discusses with the independent valuation firms the valuation reports, and then makes a recommendation to our board of directors of the value for each investment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.\n</td> <td>Our board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of such investments in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Adviser, the respective independent valuation firms and the Audit Committee.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur non-CLO investments are valued utilizing broker quotes, yield technique, enterprise value ( EV\u201d) technique, net asset value technique, liquidation technique, discounted cash flow technique, or a combination of techniques, as appropriate. The yield technique uses loan spreads for loans and other relevant information implied by market data involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Under the EV technique, the EV of a portfolio company is first determined and allocated over the portfolio company's securities in order of their preference relative to one another (i.e., waterfall\u201d allocation). To determine the EV, we\ntypically use a market (multiples) valuation approach that considers relevant and applicable market trading data of guideline public companies, transaction metrics from precedent merger and acquisitions transactions, and/or a discounted cash flow technique. The net asset value technique, an income approach, is used to derive a value of an underlying investment by dividing a relevant earnings stream by an appropriate capitalization rate. The liquidation technique is intended to approximate the net recovery value of an investment based on, among other things, assumptions regarding liquidation proceeds based on a hypothetical liquidation of a portfolio company's assets. The discounted cash flow technique converts future cash flows or earnings to a range of fair values from which a single estimate may be derived utilizing an appropriate discount rate. The fair value measurement is based on the net present value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts.\nOur investments in bonds and loans are classified as Level 3 fair value measured securities under ASC 820.\nThe types of factors that are taken into account in fair value determination include, as relevant, market changes in expected returns for similar investments, performance improvement or deterioration, security covenants, call protection provisions, and information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the issuer's ability to make payments and its earnings and cash flows, the principal markets in which the issuer does business, publicly available financial ratios of peer companies, comparisons to traded securities, enterprise values, and other relevant factors.\nOur investments in CLOs are classified as Level 3 fair value measured securities under ASC 820 and are valued using a discounted multi-path cash flow model. The CLO structures are analyzed to identify the risk exposures and to determine an appropriate call date (i.e., expected maturity). These risk factors are sensitized in the multi-path cash flow model using Monte Carlo simulations, which is a simulation used to model the probability of different outcomes, to generate probability-weighted (i.e., multi-path) cash flows from the underlying assets and liabilities. These cash flows are discounted using appropriate market discount rates, and relevant data in the CLO market as well as certain benchmark credit indices are considered, to determine the value of each CLO investment. In addition, we generate a single-path cash flow utilizing our best estimate of expected cash receipts, and assess the reasonableness of the implied discount rate that would be effective for the value derived from the multi-path cash flows. We are not responsible for and have no influence over the asset management of the portfolios underlying the CLO investments we hold, as those portfolios are managed by non-affiliated third-party CLO collateral managers. The main risk factors are default risk, prepayment risk, interest rate risk, downgrade risk, and credit spread risk.\nImpact of the novel coronavirus (the \"Wuhan Virus\") pandemic\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, our operating results were negatively impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the Wuhan Virus pandemic, which has caused severe disruptions in the global economy and negatively impacted the fair value and performance of our investment portfolio. For the year ended June 30, 2020, the resulting changes in net unrealized depreciation on investments were largely due to widening credit spreads as market participants expected a higher yield on similar investments given the significant market volatility generated by the Wuhan Virus pandemic. To a lesser extent, the changes in net unrealized depreciation on investments for the quarter for certain of our portfolio companies also reflected other factors such as specific industry concerns, uncertainty about the duration of business shutdowns and near-term liquidity needs. For additional information concerning the Wuhan Virus pandemic and its potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Part II - Other information, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Risk Factors - The Wuhan Virus pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the global economy, which has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our portfolio companies and our business and operations.\u201d\nValuation of Other Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nASC 825, Financial Instruments, specifically ASC 825-10-25, permits an entity to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value (the \"Fair Value Option\"). We have not elected the Fair Value Option to report selected financial assets and financial liabilities.\nInvestment Risks\nOur investments are subject to a variety of risks. Those risks include the following:\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the fair value of the financial instrument.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk represents the risk that we would incur if the counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their agreements with us.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk represents the possibility that we may not be able to rapidly adjust the size of our investment positions in times of high volatility and financial stress at a reasonable price.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk represents a change in interest rates, which could result in an adverse change in the fair value of an interest-bearing financial instrument.\nPrepayment Risk\nMany of our debt investments allow for prepayment of principal without penalty. Downward changes in interest rates may cause prepayments to occur at a faster than expected rate, thereby effectively shortening the maturity of the security and making us less likely to fully earn all of the expected income of that security and reinvesting in a lower yielding instrument.\nStructured Credit Related Risk\nCLO investments may be riskier and less transparent to us than direct investments in underlying companies. CLOs typically will have no significant assets other than their underlying senior secured loans. Therefore, payments on CLO investments are and will be payable solely from the cash flows from such senior secured loans.\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis. Accretion of such purchase discounts or amortization of such premiums is calculated using the effective interest method as of the settlement date and adjusted only for material amendments or prepayments. Upon the prepayment of a loan or bond, any unamortized discount or premium is recorded as interest income. The Company records dividend income on the ex-dividend date. The Company does not accrue as a receivable interest or dividends on loans and securities if it has reason to doubt its ability to collect such income. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Unpaid accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans are either applied to the cost basis or interest income, depending upon management's judgment of the collectibility of the loan receivable. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and in management's judgment, is likely to remain current and future principal and interest collections when due are probable. Interest received and applied against cost while a loan is on non-accrual, and PIK interest capitalized but not recognized while on non-accrual, is recognized prospectively on the effective yield basis through maturity of the loan when placed back on accrual status, to the extent deemed collectible by management. As of June 30, 2020, the Company did not have any loans on non-accrual status. Loan origination fees are capitalized and the Company accretes such amounts as interest income over the respective term of the loan or security. Upon the prepayment of a loan or security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. Upfront structuring fees are recorded as fee income when earned. The Company records prepayment premiums on loans and securities as fee income when it receives such amounts.\nSome of our loans and other investments may have contractual payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest or dividends. PIK income computed at the contractual rate is accrued into income and reflected as receivable up to the capitalization date. PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities. When additional securities are received, they typically have the same terms, including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued. On these payment dates, we capitalize the accrued interest (reflecting such amounts in the basis as additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. At the point that we believe PIK is not fully expected to be realized, the PIK investment will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are reversed from the related receivable through interest or dividend income, respectively. We do not reverse previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends. Upon capitalization, PIK is subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments. PIK investments on non-accrual status are restored to accrual status if we believe that PIK is expected to be realized.\nInterest income from investments in Structured Subordinated Notes (typically preferred shares, income notes or subordinated notes of CLO funds) is recorded based on an estimation of an effective yield to expected maturity utilizing assumed future cash flows in accordance with ASC 325-40, Beneficial Interest in the Securitized Financial Assets. The Company monitors the expected cash inflows from CLO equity investments, including the expected residual payments, and the estimated effective yield is determined and updated periodically. In accordance with ASC 325-40, Beneficial Interest in Securitized Financial Assets, investments in CLOs are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d). When the Company determines that a CLO has OTTI, the amortized cost basis of the CLO is written down to its fair value as of the date of the determination based on events and information evaluated and that write-down is recognized as a realized loss.\nDue from and to Adviser\nAmounts due from the Adviser are for amounts waived under the ELA (as such term is defined in Note 4) and amounts due to the Adviser are for base management fees, incentive fees, operating expenses paid on our behalf and offering and organization expenses paid on our behalf. The due from and due to Adviser balances are presented net on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of June 30, 2020 and are presented gross on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of June 30, 2019. All balances due from and to the Adviser are settled quarterly.\nPaid-In-Kind Interest\nThe Company has certain investments in its portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest provision, which represents contractual interest or dividends that are added to the principal balance and recorded as income. For the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, PIK interest included in interest income totaled $10,273 and $166, respectively. The Company stops accruing PIK interest when it is determined that PIK interest is no longer collectible. To maintain RIC tax treatment, and to avoid corporate tax, substantially all of this income must be paid out to the stockholders in the form of distributions, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash.\nOffering Costs and Expenses\nThe Company will incur certain costs and expenses in connection with registering to sell shares of its common stock. These costs and expenses principally relate to certain costs and expenses for advertising and sales, printing and marketing costs, professional and filing fees. Offering costs incurred by the Company are capitalized to deferred offering costs on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and amortized to expense over the 12 month period following such capitalization on a straight line basis. Prior to the Merger, there were offering and organizational costs due to the PWAY's investment adviser (as such term is defined in Note 4).\nDividends and Distributions\nDividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date. The amount, if any, to be paid as a monthly dividend or distribution is approved by our board of directors quarterly and generally depends on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board deems relevant from time to time. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually.\nFinancing Costs\nWe record origination expenses related to our Revolving Credit Facility as deferred financing costs. These expenses are deferred and amortized as part of interest expense using the straight-line method over the stated life of the obligation of our Revolving Credit Facility. (See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion).\nPer Share Information\nNet increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations per share is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period presented. In accordance with ASC 946, convertible securities are not considered in the calculation of net asset value per share. As of June 30, 2020, there were no issued convertible securities.\nNet Realized and Net Change in Unrealized Gains or Losses\nGains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated by using the specific identification method. The Company measures realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized.\nFederal and State Income Taxes\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d), and intends to continue to comply with the requirements of the Code applicable to RICs. As a RIC, the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable income and intends to distribute (or retain through a deemed distribution) all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain to stockholders; therefore, the Company has made no provision for income taxes. The character of income and gains that the Company will distribute is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP. Book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividends and distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified to paid-in capital.\nIf the Company does not distribute (or is not deemed to have distributed) at least 98% of its annual ordinary income and 98.2% of its net capital gains in the calendar year earned, it will generally be required to pay an excise tax equal to 4% of the amount by which 98% of its annual ordinary income and 98.2% of its capital gains exceeds the distributions from such taxable income for\nthe year. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income, it accrues excise taxes, if any, on estimated excess taxable income. As of June 30, 2020, the Company does not expect to have any excise tax due for the 2020 calendar year. Thus, the Company has not accrued any excise tax for this period.\nIf the Company fails to satisfy the annual distribution requirement or otherwise fails to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, it would be subject to tax on all of its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates. The Company would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would it be required to make distributions. Distributions would generally be taxable to the Company's individual and other non-corporate taxable stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for the reduced maximum rate applicable to qualified dividend income to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits, provided certain holding period and other requirements are met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributions would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. To qualify again to be taxed as a RIC in a subsequent year, the Company would be required to distribute to its shareholders its accumulated earnings and profits attributable to non-RIC years. In addition, if the Company failed to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, then, in order to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year, it would be required to elect to recognize and pay tax on any net built-in gain (the excess of aggregate gain, including items of income, over aggregate loss that would have been realized if we had been liquidated) or, alternatively, be subject to taxation on such built-in gain recognized for a period of five years.\nThe Company follows ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. As of June 30, 2020, the Company did not record any unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities. Management's determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an on-going analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. Although the Company files both federal and state income tax returns, its major tax jurisdiction is federal. The Company's federal tax returns for the tax years ended December 31, 2017 and thereafter remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which amends the financial instruments impairment guidance so that an entity is required to measure expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As such, an entity will use forward-looking information to estimate credit losses. ASU 2016-13 also amends the guidance in FASB ASC Subtopic No. 325-40, Investments-Other, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets, related to the subsequent measurement of accretable yield recognized as interest income over the life of a beneficial interest in securitized financial assets under the effective yield method. ASU 2016-13 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The standard will modify the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, or adding certain disclosures. ASU No. 2018-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted upon issuance of this ASU. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The standard is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the optional guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. The Company did not utilize the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), which significantly changed the Code, including a reduction in the corporate income tax rate, a new limitation on the deductibility of interest expense, and significant changes to the taxation of income earned from foreign sources and foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act also authorizes the IRS to issue regulations with respect to the new provisions. We cannot predict how the changes in the Tax Act, or regulations or other guidance issued under it, might affect us, our business or the business of our portfolio companies. However, our portfolio companies\nmay or may not make certain elections under the Tax Act that could materially increase their taxable earnings and profits.

Under the Expense Reimbursement Agreement, as amended, our Former Adviser, in consultation with the Company, could pay up to 100% of both our organizational and offering expenses and our operating expenses, all as determined by us and our Former Adviser. The Expense Reimbursement Agreement stated that until the net proceeds to us from our offering are at least $25 million, our Former Adviser could pay up to 100% of both our organizational and offering expenses and our operating expenses. After we received at least $25 million in net proceeds from our offering, our Former Adviser could, with our consent, continue to make expense support payments to us in such amounts as was acceptable to us and our Former Adviser. The Expense Reimbursement Agreement terminated on December 31, 2018. Our Former Adviser had agreed to reimburse a total of $5,292,192 as of December 31, 2018.

As of the year ended June 30, 2020, and subsequent to June 30, 2020, the Wuhan Virus pandemic has had a significant impact on the U.S. and global economy and on us. We have experienced an increase in unrealized depreciation of our investment portfolio due to decreases in fair value of its investments attributable to the impact of the Wuhan Virus pandemic on the markets.\nOn May 14, 2020, the Company decreased its offering price from $11.38 per share to $8.78 per share. The decrease in the offering price is effective for all closings occurring on or after May 15, 2020. We will sell our shares on a continuous basis at a price of $8.78 per share. On August 12, 2020, our Board of Directors determined to change the public offering price per share of our Class A shares of common stock from $8.78 per share to $9.03 per share. The change in the public offering price will be effective as of August 12, 2020 and first applied to subscriptions in good order received on or after August 12, 2020. In addition, on August 26, 2020, the Company increased its offering price from $9.03 per share to $9.33 per share. The increase in the offering price is effective for all closings occurring on or after August 26, 2020. To the extent our net asset value increases, we will sell at a price necessary to ensure that shares are not sold at a price per share, after deduction of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, that is below our net asset value per share. In connection with each closing, our board of directors or a committee thereof is required, within 48 hours of the time that each closing and sale is made, to make the determination that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price per share which, after deducting upfront selling commissions, if any, is below the then-current net asset value per share of the applicable class. Promptly following any such adjustment to the offering price per share, we will file a prospectus supplement with the SEC disclosing the adjusted offering price, and we appropriately publish the updated information.\nBase Management Fee. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% (0.4375% quarterly) of our average total assets, which includes any borrowings for investment purposes. For the first quarter of our operations following the Merger, the base management fee was calculated based on the average value of our total assets as of the date of the Investment Advisory Agreement and at the end of the calendar quarter in which the date of the Investment Advisory Agreement fell, and was appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the then current calendar quarter. Subsequently, the base management fee\nAs a BDC, we are permitted under the 1940 Act to borrow funds to finance portfolio investments. To enhance our opportunity for gain, we intend to employ leverage as market conditions permit. At the 2019 Annual Meeting, TPIC's stockholders approved a proposal allowing us to modify our asset coverage ratio requirement from 200% to 150%. As a result, we are allowed to increase our leverage capacity effective as of March 16, 2019. The use of leverage, although it may increase returns, may also increase the risk of loss to our investors, particularly if the level of our leverage is high and the value of our investments declines.\n \u2022 all other expenses incurred by our Adviser, in performing its obligations, subject to the limitations included in the Investment Advisory Agreement; and \nRelated Party Transactions\nWe entered into a license agreement with an affiliate of our Adviser, pursuant to which the affiliate granted us a non-exclusive, royalty free license to use the Prospect\u201d name. Under this license agreement, we have the right to use such name for so long as our Adviser or another affiliate of Prospect Capital Management is our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the Prospect\u201d name or logo.\nThe North American Securities Administrators Association, in its Omnibus Guidelines Statement of Policy adopted on March 29, 1992 and as amended on May 7, 2007 and from time to time, requires that our sponsor and its affiliates have an aggregate financial net worth, exclusive of home, automobile and home furnishings, of 5% of the first $20,000 of both the gross amount of securities currently being offered and the gross amount of any originally issued direct participation program sold by our sponsor and its affiliates within the last 12 months, plus 1% of all amounts in excess of the first $20,000. Based on these requirements, our sponsor and its affiliates have an aggregate net worth in excess of those amounts required by the Omnibus Guidelines Statement of Policy.\nIn all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment.\nAllocation of Expenses\nWe are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act\u201d). Our investment objective is to generate current income and, as a secondary objective, capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. We intend to meet our investment objective by primarily lending to and investing in the debt of privately-owned U.S. middle market companies, which we define as companies with annual revenue between $50 million and $2.5 billion. We have elected and intend to continue to qualify annually to be taxed for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (\"RIC\") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\").\nDividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date. The amount, if any, to be paid as a monthly dividend or distribution is approved by our board of directors quarterly and generally depends on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board deems relevant from time to time. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The standard will modify the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, or adding certain disclosures. ASU No. 2018-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted upon issuance of this ASU. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company determines the fair value of its investment portfolio each quarter. The fair values of the Company's investments are determined in good faith by the Company's board of directors. The Company's board of directors is solely responsible for the valuation of the Company's portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the Company's valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process.\nOur investments in CLOs are classified as Level 3 fair value measured securities under ASC 820 and are valued using a discounted multi-path cash flow model. The CLO structures are analyzed to identify the risk exposures and to determine an appropriate call date (i.e., expected maturity). These risk factors are sensitized in the multi-path cash flow model using Monte Carlo simulations, which is a simulation used to model the probability of different outcomes, to generate probability-weighted (i.e., multi-path) cash flows from the underlying assets and liabilities. These cash flows are discounted using appropriate market discount rates, and relevant data in the CLO market as well as certain benchmark credit indices are considered, to determine the value of each CLO investment. In addition, we generate a single-path cash flow utilizing our best estimate of expected cash receipts, and assess the reasonableness of the implied discount rate that would be effective for the value derived from the multi-path cash flows. We are not responsible for and have no influence over the asset management of the portfolios underlying the CLO investments we hold, as those portfolios are managed by non-affiliated third-party CLO collateral managers. The main risk factors are default risk, prepayment risk, interest rate risk, downgrade risk, and credit spread risk.\nWe will bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to:\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d), and intends to continue to comply with the requirements of the Code applicable to RICs. As a RIC, the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable income and intends to distribute (or retain through a deemed distribution) all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain to stockholders; therefore, the Company has made no provision for income taxes. The character of income and gains that the Company will distribute is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP. Book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividends and distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified to paid-in capital.\n\n \u2022 fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws; \nEffective March 31, 2019, TPIC and PWAY entered into a tax free business combination. Concurrent with the Merger, TPIC, the legal acquirer, was renamed Prospect Flexible Income Fund, Inc. (formerly known as TP Flexible Income Fund, Inc.) As a result of the Merger the Company issued 775,193 shares of the Company's common stock to the former shareholders of PWAY and all shares of PWAY were retired.\nPursuant to the expense limitation support payment (discussed below), the sponsor reimbursed the Company $(708,464), $(309,881) and $(748,696) for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2020, the U.S. loan market exhibited a heightened level of volatility. While U.S. loan prices remained relatively stable throughout February 2020, the increasingly negative sentiment associated with the economic ramifications of the rapid spread of Wuhan Virus led to a precipitous decline in U.S. loan prices in the quarter ended March 31, 2020. During quarter end June 30, 2020, U.S. loan prices rebounded and as a result, our portfolio increased in value during the three months ended June 30, 2020.\nValuation of Other Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nCertain officers and directors of the Company are also officers and directors of the Adviser and its affiliates. There were no fees paid to the independent directors of the Company as the Company did not exceed the minimum net asset value required (i.e., greater than $100 million) to receive a fee for the year ended June 30, 2020. The officers do not receive any direct compensation from the Company.\nEquity Issuances\nWe generate revenue in the form of dividends, interest and capital gains on the debt securities, equity interests and CLOs that we hold. In addition, we may generate revenue from our portfolio companies in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees and performance-based fees. Any such fees will be recognized as earned.\nThe Dealer Manager is not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of shares but will use its best efforts to sell the shares offered. The minimum investment in shares of our common stock is $5,000.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nThe cost, fair value and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of the investments of TPIC as of the date of the Merger, was as follows:\nContractual Obligations\nWe record origination expenses related to our Revolving Credit Facility as deferred financing costs. These expenses are deferred and amortized as part of interest expense using the straight-line method over the stated life of the obligation of our Revolving Credit Facility. (See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion).\nWe intend to primarily lend to and invest in the debt of privately-owned U.S. middle market companies. We may on occasion invest in smaller or larger companies if an attractive opportunity presents itself, especially when there are dislocations in the capital markets. We expect to focus primarily on making investments in syndicated senior secured first lien loans, syndicated senior secured second lien loans, and to a lesser extent, subordinated debt, of middle market companies in a broad range of industries. Syndicated secured loans refer to commercial loans provided by a group of lenders that are structured, arranged, and administered by one or several commercial or investment banks, known as arrangers. These loans are then sold (or syndicated) to other banks or institutional investors. Syndicated secured loans may have a first priority lien on a borrower's assets (i.e., senior secured first lien loans), a second priority lien on a borrower's assets (i.e., senior secured second lien loans), or a lower lien or unsecured position on the borrower's assets (i.e., subordinated debt). We expect our target credit investments will typically have initial maturities between three and ten years and generally range in size between $1 million and $100 million, although the investment size will vary with the size of our capital base. We expect that the majority of our debt investments will bear interest at floating interest rates, but our portfolio may also include fixed-rate investments. We also expect to make our investments directly through the primary issuance by the borrower or in the secondary market.\nOn August 12, 2020, the Company increased its offering price from $8.78 per share to $9.03 per share. The increase in the offering price is effective for all closings occurring on or after August 12, 2020. In addition, on August 26, 2020, the Company increased its offering price from $9.03 per share to $9.33 per share. The increase in the offering price is effective for all closings occurring on or after August 26, 2020.\nInvestment Advisory Fees\nmanager fee of up to 3.0% of the gross offering proceeds of Class A Shares sold in our offering. The amended dealer manager agreement became effective on August 26, 2020.\nLevel 1. Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.\nPWAY as the accounting acquirer acquired 32% of the voting interests of TPIC. The below table summarizes the purchase price allocation from TPIC:\n \u2022 investment advisory fees; \nOffering Price\nCost and Expenses\n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; \n \u2022 fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments; \nmay waive a portion or all of the investment advisory fees that it is entitled to receive under the Investment Advisory Agreement\nThe extent of the impact of the Wuhan Virus pandemic on the financial performance of our current and future investments will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the virus, related advisories and restrictions, and the health of the financial markets and economy, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. To the extent our portfolio companies are adversely impacted by the effects of the Wuhan Virus pandemic, it may have a material adverse impact on its future net investment income, the fair value of its portfolio investments, its financial condition and the results of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies.\nRevenues\nin order to limit the Company's operating expenses to an annual rate, expressed as a percentage of the Company's average quarterly\nOur Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company and is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Our Adviser is controlled by Prospect Capital Management, who owns a majority of its voting units. Mr. Eliasek is the principal officer of the Adviser.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nNet Unrealized Gains/Losses on Investments\nmay or may not make certain elections under the Tax Act that could materially increase their taxable earnings and profits. Any such increase in the taxable earnings and profits of a portfolio company may result in the characterization of certain distributions sourced from sale proceeds as dividend income, which may increase our distributable taxable income.\nFinancing Costs\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, our operating results were negatively impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the Wuhan Virus pandemic, which has caused severe disruptions in the global economy and negatively impacted the fair value and performance of our investment portfolio. For the year ended June 30, 2020, the resulting changes in net unrealized depreciation on investments were largely due to widening credit spreads as market participants expected a higher yield on similar investments given the significant market volatility generated by the Wuhan Virus pandemic. To a lesser extent, the changes in net unrealized depreciation on investments for the quarter for certain of our portfolio companies also reflected other factors such as specific industry concerns, uncertainty about the duration of business shutdowns and near-term liquidity needs. For additional information concerning the Wuhan Virus pandemic and its potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Part II - Other information, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Risk Factors - The Wuhan Virus pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the global economy, which has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our portfolio companies and our business and operations.\u201d\nThe offering of our common stock represents a continuous offering of our shares. The initial offering of our common stock commenced on September 4, 2012 and terminated on March 1, 2016. On March 17, 2016, we commenced the follow-on offering of our common stock, which follow-on offering is currently ongoing. We intend to file post-effective amendments to our registration statement to allow us to continue our offering for three years. On September 26, 2019, we filed with the SEC an amendment to our registration statement, which was declared effective September 26, 2019, in order to continue our continuous public offering of our shares.\nAs part of the dividend reinvestment plan, we issued 7,087, 7,095 and 11,449 shares of our common stock on April 3, 2020, May 1, 2020 and June 5, 2020, respectively. On July 6, 2020 we issued 7,120 shares of our common stock in connection with the dividend reinvestment plan for June 2020 distributions.\nLicense Agreement\nBelow is the asset coverage for the twelve month ended June 30, 2020 and the year ended June 30, 2019.\nIn the Merger, common shareholders of PWAY received newly-issued common shares in the Company having an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset value of their holdings of PWAY Class A and/or PWAY Class I common shares, as applicable, as determined at the close of business on March 27, 2019, as permitted by the Merger Agreement. The differences in net asset value between March 27, 2019 and March 31, 2019 were not material. Relevant details pertaining to the Merger are as follows:\nThe legal expenses for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively, were $175,811, $833,849 and $49,565. The legal expenses for the year ended June 30, 2019 were higher due to the costs incurred in order to close the Merger.\n \u2022 20.0% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 1.875% in any calendar quarter (7.5% annualized) will be payable to our Adviser. This reflects that once the preferred return is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 20.0% of all pre-incentive fee net investment income thereafter will be allocated to our Adviser.  Capital Gains Incentive Fee. The second part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the capital gains incentive fee, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20.00% of our realized capital gains for the calendar year, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation at the end of such year. In determining the capital gains incentive fee payable to the Adviser, we calculate the aggregate realized capital gains, aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, as applicable, with respect to each investment that has been in our portfolio. For the purpose of this calculation, an investment\u201d is defined as the total of all rights and claims which may be asserted against a portfolio company arising from our participation in the debt, equity, and other financial instruments issued by that company. Aggregate realized capital gains, if any, equal the sum of the differences between the aggregate net sales price of each investment and the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment when sold or otherwise disposed. Aggregate realized capital losses equal the sum of the amounts by which the aggregate net sales price of each investment is less than the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment when sold or otherwise disposed. Aggregate unrealized capital depreciation equals the sum of the differences, if negative, between the aggregate valuation of each investment and the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment as of the applicable calendar year-end. At the end of the applicable calendar year, the amount of capital gains that serves as the basis for our calculation of the capital gains incentive fee involves netting aggregate realized capital gains against aggregate realized capital losses on a since-inception basis and then reducing this amount by the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation. If this number is positive, then the capital gains incentive fee payable is equal to 20.00% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains incentive fees paid since inception. Operating expenses are not taken into account when determining capital gains incentive fees.\nOur board of directors has authorized, and has declared, cash distributions on our common stock on a monthly basis since the second quarter of 2015 (in our capacity as TPIC). The amount of each such distribution is subject to our board of directors' discretion and applicable legal restrictions related to the payment of distributions. We calculate each stockholder's specific distribution amount for the month using record and declaration dates, and distributions will begin to accrue on the date we accept subscriptions for shares of our common stock. From time to time, we may also pay interim distributions at the discretion of our board of directors. Each year a statement on Internal Revenue Service Form 1099-DIV (or any successor form) identifying the source of the distribution (i.e.,(i) paid from investment company taxable income, which is generally our net ordinary income plus our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital gains, (ii) paid from net capital gain on the sale\nCLO investments may be riskier and less transparent to us than direct investments in underlying companies. CLOs typically will have no significant assets other than their underlying senior secured loans. Therefore, payments on CLO investments are and will be payable solely from the cash flows from such senior secured loans.\nOn and effective August 5, 2020, we changed our name to Prospect Flexible Income Fund, Inc. from TP Flexible Income Fund, Inc. by filing Articles of Amendment to our Fourth Articles of Amendment and Restatement, as amended and supplemented.\nIn connection with the Merger, PWAY incurred certain associated costs and expenses of approximately $731,000, of which $709,000 of these costs and expenses were expensed by PWAY and $22,000 were expensed by the Company. In connection with the Merger, TPIC incurred certain associated costs and expenses of approximately $682,000, of which $636,000 were expensed by TPIC and $46,000 were expensed by the Company.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs of June 30, 2020, our investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $36,663,703, consisted of interests in 27 portfolio companies and 24 structured subordinated notes. The following table presents certain selected information regarding our portfolio composition and weighted average yields as of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019:\nName Change\nWe have entered into certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. On March 31, 2019, we entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with Prospect Flexible Income Management, LLC in accordance with the 1940 Act. The Investment Advisory Agreement became effective upon consummation of the Merger. Prospect Flexible Income Management,\nWe seek to be a long-term investor with our portfolio companies. During the three months and twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we purchased investment securities (excluding short-term securities) of $1,675,000 and $23,678,340, respectively. During the same three month and twelve month period, sales and redemptions of investment securities (excluding short-term securities) were $2,286,635 and $8,271,306, respectively, resulting in a total net portfolio decline of ($611,634) for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and a total net portfolio growth of $15,407,034 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020.\nThe Company and its Adviser have entered into a dealer manager agreement with Triton Pacific Securities, LLC pursuant to which the Company will pay the Dealer Manager a fee of up to 9.0% of gross proceeds raised in the Company's offering, some of which will be re-allowed to other participating broker-dealers. In addition to the upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees, the Adviser may pay the Dealer Manager a fee (the \"Additional Selling Commissions\") equal to no more than 1.0% of the net asset value per share per year. The Dealer Manager will reallow all or a portion of the Additional Selling Commissions to participating broker-dealers. The Dealer Manager is an affiliated entity of the Former Adviser and is partially owned by one of our directors, Craig Faggen.\nInvestment Transactions\n \u2022 federal and state registration fees; \nPrepayment Risk\nOn December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), which significantly changed the Code, including a reduction in the corporate income tax rate, a new limitation on the deductibility of interest expense, and significant changes to the taxation of income earned from foreign sources and foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act also authorizes the IRS to issue regulations with respect to the new provisions. We cannot predict how the changes in the Tax Act, or regulations or other guidance issued under it, might affect us, our business or the business of our portfolio companies. However, our portfolio companies\nWe may borrow funds to make investments at any time, including before we have fully invested the proceeds of our offering, to the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities, or if our board of directors determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. We have not yet decided, however, whether, and to what extent, we will finance portfolio investments using debt. We do not currently anticipate issuing any preferred stock.\nOn August 14, 2020, the Company funded $45,455 of the total $85,227 delayed draw term loan commitment for our investment in Amerilife Holdings, LLC portfolio company.\nThe types of factors that are taken into account in fair value determination include, as relevant, market changes in expected returns for similar investments, performance improvement or deterioration, security covenants, call protection provisions, and information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the issuer's ability to make payments and its earnings and cash flows, the principal markets in which the issuer does business, publicly available financial ratios of peer companies, comparisons to traded securities, enterprise values, and other relevant factors.\nThe terms FLEX,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d mean Prospect Flexible Income Fund, Inc.

Asset coverage\u201d generally refers to a company's total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities,\u201d as defined in the 1940 Act, divided by total senior securities representing indebtedness and, if applicable, preferred stock. Senior securities\u201d for this purpose includes borrowings from banks or other lenders, debt securities and preferred stock.\n \u2022 legal, accounting and other costs associated with structuring, negotiating, documenting and completing our investment transactions; \n \u2022 transfer agent and custodial fees; \n 4. Our board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of such investments in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Adviser, the respective independent valuation firms and the Audit Committee. \nWhen market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, our board of directors has approved a multi-step valuation process for each quarter, as described below, and such investments are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy:\nNet Investment Income\nRepurchase Offer\nInvestment Activity\nis payable quarterly in arrears, and is calculated based on the average value of our total assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and is appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the then current calendar quarter. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter is appropriately pro-rated. At the Adviser's option, the base management fee for any period may be deferred, without interest thereon, and paid to the Adviser at any time subsequent to any such deferral as the Adviser determines.\nWe have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with our Adviser. We will pay our Adviser a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components - a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee payable to the Adviser and any incentive fees it earns will ultimately be borne by our stockholders. See -Investment Advisory Fees.\u201d\nLLC serves as our investment adviser in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. Payments under the Investment Advisory Agreement in each reporting period will consist of (i) a management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our gross assets and (ii) income and capital gains incentive fees based on our performance.\nInterest income from investments in Structured Subordinated Notes (typically preferred shares, income notes or subordinated notes of CLO funds) is recorded based on an estimation of an effective yield to expected maturity utilizing assumed future cash flows in accordance with ASC 325-40, Beneficial Interest in the Securitized Financial Assets. The Company monitors the expected cash inflows from CLO equity investments, including the expected residual payments, and the estimated effective yield is determined and updated periodically. In accordance with ASC 325-40, Beneficial Interest in Securitized Financial Assets, investments in CLOs are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d). When the Company determines that a CLO has OTTI, the amortized cost basis of the CLO is written down to its fair value as of the date of the determination based on events and information evaluated and that write-down is recognized as a realized loss.\nMany of our debt investments allow for prepayment of principal without penalty. Downward changes in interest rates may cause prepayments to occur at a faster than expected rate, thereby effectively shortening the maturity of the security and making us less likely to fully earn all of the expected income of that security and reinvesting in a lower yielding instrument.\nWe measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized.\nAdministration Agreement\nLiquidity risk represents the possibility that we may not be able to rapidly adjust the size of our investment positions in times of high volatility and financial stress at a reasonable price.\nPaid-In-Kind Interest\nMarket risk represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the fair value of the financial instrument.\nCredit Risk\nOther than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities.\nThe cost of portfolio management software is initially borne by the Company, which then allocates to PSEC its proportional share of such expense. During the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred $0, $11,058 and $23,603, respectively, in expenses related to the portfolio management software that is attributable to PSEC. PSEC reimburses the Company for these expenses and included them as part of general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, $0 of expense is due from PSEC.\nExpense Reimbursement Agreement with our Former Adviser\nConcurrently with the closing of the Merger, we entered into an Expense Limitation Agreement with our Adviser (the ELA\u201d). Pursuant to the ELA, our Adviser, in its sole discretion, may waive a portion or all of the investment advisory fees that it is entitled to receive pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement in order to limit our Operating Expenses (as defined below) to an annual rate, expressed as a percentage of our average quarterly net assets, equal to 8.00% (the Annual Limit\u201d). For purposes of the ELA, the term Operating Expenses\u201d with respect to the Company, is defined to include all expenses necessary or appropriate for the operation of the Company, including but not limited to our Adviser's base management fee, any and all costs and expenses that qualify as line item organization and offering\u201d expenses in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as the same are filed with the SEC and other expenses described in the Investment Advisory Agreement, but does not include any portfolio transaction or other investment-related costs (including brokerage commissions, dealer and underwriter spreads, prime broker fees and expenses and dividend expenses related to short sales), interest expenses and other financing costs, extraordinary expenses and acquired fund fees and expenses. Upfront shareholder transaction expenses (such as sales commissions, dealer manager fees, and similar expenses) are not Operating Expenses. On April 30, 2020, the Company's board of directors approved extending the Expense Limitation Agreement for an additional 12-month term ending on April 30, 2021\n\ntypically use a market (multiples) valuation approach that considers relevant and applicable market trading data of guideline public companies, transaction metrics from precedent merger and acquisitions transactions, and/or a discounted cash flow technique. The net asset value technique, an income approach, is used to derive a value of an underlying investment by dividing a relevant earnings stream by an appropriate capitalization rate. The liquidation technique is intended to approximate the net recovery value of an investment based on, among other things, assumptions regarding liquidation proceeds based on a hypothetical liquidation of a portfolio company's assets. The discounted cash flow technique converts future cash flows or earnings to a range of fair values from which a single estimate may be derived utilizing an appropriate discount rate. The fair value measurement is based on the net present value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts.\nOur investments in bonds and loans are classified as Level 3 fair value measured securities under ASC 820.\nCertain members of our senior management hold an equity interest in our Adviser. Members of our senior management also serve as principals of other investment managers affiliated with our Adviser that do and may in the future manage investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles with investment objectives similar to ours.\nNet increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations per share is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period presented. In accordance with ASC 946, convertible securities are not considered in the calculation of net asset value per share. As of June 30, 2020, there were no issued convertible securities.\nLiquidity Risk\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe expect to dynamically allocate our assets in varying types of investments based on our analysis of the credit markets, which may result in our portfolio becoming more concentrated in particular types of credit instruments (such as senior secured loans) and less invested in other types of credit instruments. The loans in which we intend to invest are often rated by a nationally recognized ratings organization, and generally carry a rating below investment grade (rated lower than Baa3\u201d by Moody's Investors Service or lower than BBB-\u201d by Standard & Poor's Corporation - also known as high yield\u201d or junk bonds\u201d). However, we may also invest in non-rated debt securities.\nThe table below describes investments by industry classification and enumerates the percentage, by fair value, of the total portfolio assets in such industries as of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019:\n \u2022 corporate and organizational expenses relating to offerings of our common stock, subject to limitations included in the investment advisory and management services agreement; \nDebt Issuances and Redemptions\nAt the 2019 Annual Meeting, stockholders approved the application to the Company of the 150% minimum asset coverage ratio set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, and subject to certain additional disclosure requirements and the repurchase obligations described above, the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to the Company was reduced from 200% to 150%, effective as of March 16, 2019.\nSecurities that are publicly-traded are valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market are valued by an independent pricing agent or more than one principal market maker, if available, otherwise a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. We value over-the-counter securities by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which were provided by an independent pricing agent and screened for validity by such service. As a result of the volatility and disruption to the global economy from the Wuhan Virus pandemic (as further discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements), certain market quotations were not deemed to represent fair value.\n \u2022 No incentive fee will be payable to our Adviser in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the preferred return rate of 1.5%. \nRecent Developments\nFederal and State Income Taxes\nOn June 9, 2020, under our share repurchase program, we made an offer to purchase (the \"Tender Offer\") up to the number of shares of our issued and outstanding Class A common stock we can repurchase with the proceeds we receive from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan prior to the expiration of the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer is for cash at a price equal to the net offering price per share determined as of July 10, 2020 ( Purchase Price\u201d). The offer expired at 4:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on July 8, 2020 and a total of 65,266 shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the offer. In accordance with the terms of the offer, the Company purchased 28,786 shares validly tendered and not withdrawn at a price equal to $8.25 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $237,488.\nDuring the period beginning July 1, 2020 and ending August 27, 2020, the Company made 2 investments totaling $1,189,063. During the period beginning July 1, 2020 and ending August 27, 2020, the Company sold 1 investment totaling $446,250.\nLicense Agreement\nOfficers and Directors\n\nDistributions\nThe cost of filing software is initially borne by PSEC, which then allocates to the Company its proportional share of such expense. During the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, PSEC incurred $9,065, $9,390 and $10,162, respectively in expenses related to the filing services that are attributable to the Company. The Company reimburses PSEC for these expenses and includes them as part of general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, $0 and $2,348 was due to PSEC, respectively.\nThe cost of valuation services for CLOs is initially borne by Priority Income Fund, Inc. (\"PRIS\"), which then allocates to the Company its proportional share of such expense. During the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, PRIS incurred $77,212, $61,311 and $60,004, respectively, in expenses related to valuation services that are attributable to the Company. The Company reimburses PRIS for these expenses and includes them as part of valuation services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Our distributions may exceed our earnings, especially during the period before we have substantially invested the proceeds from our offering. As a result, a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital for tax purposes.\nTo seek to enhance our returns, we may employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of our Adviser, but in no event will leverage employed exceed the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act.\nOn May 16, 2019, we established a $50 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) with Royal Bank of Canada, a Canadian chartered bank ( RBC\u201d), acting as administrative agent. In connection with the credit facility, our wholly owned financing subsidiary, Prospect Flexible Funding, LLC (the \"SPV\"), as borrower, and each of the other parties thereto, entered into a Revolving Loan Agreement, dated as of May 16, 2019 (the Loan Agreement\u201d). The SPV is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that was formed to facilitate the transactions under the Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the SPV holds certain of the securities that would otherwise be owned by the Company to be used as the borrowing base and collateral under the Credit Facility. Income paid on these investments is distributed to the Company pursuant to a waterfall after taxes, fees, expenses, and debt service. The lenders under the Credit Facility have a security interest in the investments held by the SPV. Although these investments are owned by the SPV, because the SPV is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, the Company is subject to all of the benefits and risks associated with the Credit Facility and the investments held by the SPV.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 we generated $3,342,618, $1,410,726 and $1,298,317, respectively, in investment income in the form of interest and fees earned on our debt portfolio. Such revenues were primarily cash income and non-cash portions related to the accretion of discounts.\nOn March 12, 2020, we made an offer to the Eligible Stockholders as part of the Special Repurchase Offer (the \"Offer\") to purchase up to 402,917.5 shares of the Company's issued and outstanding Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a price equal to the net asset value per share determined as of April 14, 2020. The Offer expired at 4:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on April 9, 2020 and a total of 52,987 shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. In accordance with the terms of the Offer, the Company purchased all of the shares validly tendered and not withdrawn at a price equal to $8.05 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $426,546.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively, we received proceeds from sales and repayments on unaffiliated investments of $8,271,306, $9,854,278 and $5,320,764, from which we realized gains (losses) of $(1,552,290), $(1,202,884) and $181,008.\nThe Company will incur certain costs and expenses in connection with registering to sell shares of its common stock. These costs and expenses principally relate to certain costs and expenses for advertising and sales, printing and marketing costs, professional and filing fees. Offering costs incurred by the Company are capitalized to deferred offering costs on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and amortized to expense over the 12 month period following such capitalization on a straight line basis. Prior to the Merger, there were offering and organizational costs due to the PWAY's investment adviser (as such term is defined in Note 4).\nAsset Coverage\nThe common shares outstanding, net assets applicable to common shares and NAV per common share outstanding immediately before and after the Merger were as follows:\nWe elected to be treated, beginning with our fiscal year ending December 31, 2012, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under the Code. To maintain RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute at least 90% of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: (i) 98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of our recognized capital gains in excess of recognized capital losses for the one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any ordinary income or capital gains recognized but not distributed in preceding years and on which we paid no federal income tax.\nOn August 4, 2020, we entered into a license agreement with an affiliate of our Adviser, pursuant to which the affiliate granted us a non-exclusive, royalty free license to use the Prospect\u201d name. Under this license agreement, we have the right to use such name for so long as our Adviser or another affiliate of Prospect Capital Management is our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the Prospect\u201d name or logo.\nASC 825, Financial Instruments, specifically ASC 825-10-25, permits an entity to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value (the \"Fair Value Option\"). We have not elected the Fair Value Option to report selected financial assets and financial liabilities.\nManagement has evaluated all known subsequent events through the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements were available to be issued on August 27, 2020 and notes the following:\nCredit risk represents the risk that we would incur if the counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their agreements with us.\n \u2022 the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; \nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which amends the financial instruments impairment guidance so that an entity is required to measure expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As such, an entity will use forward-looking information to estimate credit losses. ASU 2016-13 also amends the guidance in FASB ASC Subtopic No. 325-40, Investments-Other, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets, related to the subsequent measurement of accretable yield recognized as interest income over the life of a beneficial interest in securitized financial assets under the effective yield method. ASU 2016-13 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\n 2. The independent valuation firms prepare independent valuations based on their own independent assessments and issue their reports. \n \u2022 the cost of effecting sales and repurchase of shares of our common stock and other securities; \nThe base management fees for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively, were $708,464, $281,078 and $264,101. The base management fees for the the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, increased as a result of the increase in assets as a result of the Merger.\nNet Realized and Net Change in Unrealized Gains or Losses\nThe Credit Facility matures on May 21, 2029 and generally bears an interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.55%. On May 11, 2020, the Company agreed to the increased interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.20% on the Credit Facility for the period between May 16, 2020 to November 15, 2020. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the SPV's properties and assets. Under the Loan Agreement, the SPV has made certain customary representations and warranties and is required to comply with various covenants, including reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The Loan Agreement includes usual and customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature.\nCredit Facility\nAny amount waived pursuant to the ELA is subject to repayment to our Adviser (an ELA Reimbursement\u201d) by us within the three years following the end of the quarter in which the waiver was made by our Adviser. If the ELA is terminated or expires pursuant to its terms, our Adviser maintains its right to repayment for any waiver it has made under the ELA, subject to the Repayment Limitations (discussed below).\nAny ELA Reimbursement can be made solely in the event that we have sufficient excess cash on hand at the time of any proposed ELA Reimbursement and shall be limited to the lesser of (i) the excess of the Annual Limit applicable to such quarter over the Company's actual Operating Expenses for such quarter and (ii) the amount of ELA Reimbursement which, when added to the Company's expenses for such quarter, permits the Company to pay the then-current aggregate quarterly distribution to its shareholders, at a minimum annualized rate of at least 6.00% (based on the gross offering prices of Company shares) (the Distribution\u201d) from the sum of (x) the Company's net investment income (loss) for such quarter plus (y) the Company's net realized gains (losses) for such quarter (collectively, the Repayment Limitations\u201d). For the purposes of the calculations pursuant to (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence, any ELA Reimbursement will be treated as an expense of the Company for such quarter, without regard to the GAAP treatment of such expense. In the event that the Company is unable to make a full payment of any ELA Reimbursements due for any applicable quarter because the Company does not have sufficient excess cash on hand, any such unpaid amount shall become a payable of the Company for accounting purposes and shall be paid when the Company has sufficient cash on hand (subject to the Repayment Limitations); provided, that in the case of any ELA Reimbursements, such payment shall be made no later than the date that is three years following the end of the quarter in which the applicable waiver was made by our Adviser.\nAs a BDC, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making our investments. For example, we have in the past and expect in the future to co-invest on a concurrent basis with certain affiliates, consistent with applicable regulations and our allocation procedures. On January 13, 2020, the parent company of the Adviser received an exemptive order from the SEC granting the ability to negotiate terms, other than price and quantity, of co-investment transactions with other funds managed by our Adviser or certain affiliates, including us, Prospect Capital Corporation and Priority Income Fund, Inc., subject to certain conditions included therein. Under the terms of the Order permitting us to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates, a majority of our independent directors who have no financial interest in the transaction must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies. The Order also imposes reporting and record keeping requirements and limitations on transactional fees. We may only co-invest with certain entities affiliated with our Adviser in negotiated transactions originated by our Adviser or its affiliates in accordance with such Order and existing regulatory guidance. See Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These co-investment transactions may give rise to conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest among us and the other participating accounts. To mitigate these conflicts, our Adviser and its affiliates will seek to allocate portfolio transactions for all of the participating investment accounts, including us, on a fair and equitable basis, taking into account such factors as the relative amounts of capital available for new investments, the applicable investment programs and portfolio positions, the clients for which participation is appropriate and any other factors deemed appropriate. We intend to make all of our investments in compliance with the 1940 Act and in a manner that will not jeopardize our status as a BDC or RIC.\nPer Share Information\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, purchases of investment securities (excluding short-term securities) were $12,454,720. During the same period, sales and redemptions of investment securities (excluding short-term securities) were $9,854,278. As of June 30, 2019, our investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $24,019,563, consisted of interests in 53 investment companies (76% in senior secured bonds, 2% in senior secured notes, 2% in equity/other and 20% in CLO - subordinated notes). In connection with the Merger, the Company expected to have its portfolio repositioned, including by selling portfolio investments that were not qualifying assets\u201d under the 1940 Act, for cash and re-investing such proceeds in assets that were qualifying assets\u201d under the 1940 Act and consistent with the Company's investment strategy. As of June 30, 2019, a substantial amount of such portfolio repositioning had been completed by the Company.\nMarket Risk\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K (the \"Annual Report\"). In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from any results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere herein.\nOur net investment income totaled $567,042, $268,928 and $518,793 for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively.\nInvestment Risks\nOn March 23, 2018, an amendment to Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act was signed into law to permit BDCs to reduce the minimum asset coverage\u201d ratio from 200% to 150%, so long as certain approval and disclosure requirements are satisfied. In addition, for BDCs like the Company whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, the Company is also required to offer to repurchase its outstanding shares at the rate of 25% per quarter over four calendar quarters. Under the existing 200% minimum asset coverage ratio, the Company is permitted to borrow up to one dollar for investment purposes for every one dollar of investor equity, and under the 150% minimum asset coverage ratio, the Company will be permitted to borrow up to two dollars for investment purposes for every one dollar of investor equity. In other words, Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, as amended, permits BDCs to potentially increase their debt-to-equity ratio from a maximum of 1 to 1 to a maximum of 2 to 1.\nThe Company has certain investments in its portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest provision, which represents contractual interest or dividends that are added to the principal balance and recorded as income. For the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, PIK interest included in interest income totaled $10,273 and $166, respectively. The Company stops accruing PIK interest when it is determined that PIK interest is no longer collectible. To maintain RIC tax treatment, and to avoid corporate tax, substantially all of this income must be paid out to the stockholders in the form of distributions, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash.\n\nInvestment Income\nGeneral\nExpense Limitation Agreement\n \u2022 direct costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone, and staff; \nWe believe that our current cash on hand and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations.

During the same three month and twelve month period, sales and redemptions of investment securities (excluding short-term securities) were $2,286,635 and $8,271,306, respectively, resulting in a total net portfolio decline of ($611,634) for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and a total net portfolio growth of $15,407,034 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, our investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $36,663,703, consisted of interests in 54 investments (82% in senior secured loans, 2% in senior secured notes, 2% in equity/other and 14% in CLO - subordinated notes). During the three months and twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the investment activity continued to focus on repositioning the portfolio as a result of the Merger.\nOur investments are subject to a variety of risks.

Under the 1940 Act, ASC 946, and the regulations pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X, we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company or an operating company which provides substantially all of its services to benefit us. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Prospect Flexible Funding, LLC. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nIncentive Fee. The incentive fee consists of two parts: (1) the subordinated incentive fee on income and (2) the capital gains incentive fee.\nWe are offering for sale a maximum amount of $300,000,000 our shares of common stock on a \"best efforts\" basis. We are currently offering to sell our Class A Shares up to the maximum offering amount, at an offering price of $9.03 per Class A Share. As of August 27, 2020, we have sold a total of 2,367,478 shares of common stock, including 198,792 shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, for gross proceeds of approximately $31,652,992, including the reduction due to ($2,761,851) in shares repurchased pursuant to the Company's share repurchase program and 14,815 shares of common stock sold to Triton Pacific Adviser, LLC, our former investment adviser (the Former Adviser\u201d) in exchange for gross proceeds of $200,003. As a result of the Merger, the Company issued 775,193 shares.\n \u2022 independent directors' fees and expenses; \nAs part of our investment objective to generate current income, we expect that at least 70% of our investments will consist primarily of syndicated senior secured first lien loans, syndicated senior secured second lien loans, and to a lesser extent, subordinated debt. We expect that up to 30% of our investments will consist of other securities, including private equity (both common and preferred), dividend-paying equity, royalties, and the equity and junior debt tranches of collateralized loan obligations (\"CLOs\"), which we also refer to as subordinated structured notes (\"SSNs\"). The senior secured loans underlying our CLO investments are expected typically to be BB or B rated (non-investment grade, which are often referred to as high yield\u201d or junk\u201d) and in limited circumstances, unrated, senior secured loans.\nIf the Company does not distribute (or is not deemed to have distributed) at least 98% of its annual ordinary income and 98.2% of its net capital gains in the calendar year earned, it will generally be required to pay an excise tax equal to 4% of the amount by which 98% of its annual ordinary income and 98.2% of its capital gains exceeds the distributions from such taxable income for\nnet assets, equal to 8.00%. See Expense Limitation Agreement\u201d below.\nExpense Limitation Agreement\nfor tax purposes. Further, the components of net assets of the Company reflect the combined components of net assets of both PWAY and TPIC.\nThe Company follows ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. As of June 30, 2020, the Company did not record any unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities. Management's determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an on-going analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. Although the Company files both federal and state income tax returns, its major tax jurisdiction is federal. The Company's federal tax returns for the tax years ended December 31, 2017 and thereafter remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe amortization of offering costs for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively, were $575,073, $165,517 and $358,608. The increase in offering costs was driven by the increased marketing efforts as a result of the Merger.\nInterest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis. Accretion of such purchase discounts or amortization of such premiums is calculated using the effective interest method as of the settlement date and adjusted only for material amendments or prepayments. Upon the prepayment of a loan or bond, any unamortized discount or premium is recorded as interest income. The Company records dividend income on the ex-dividend date. The Company does not accrue as a receivable interest or dividends on loans and securities if it has reason to doubt its ability to collect such income. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Unpaid accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans are either applied to the cost basis or interest income, depending upon management's judgment of the collectibility of the loan receivable. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and in management's judgment, is likely to remain current and future principal and interest collections when due are probable. Interest received and applied against cost while a loan is on non-accrual, and PIK interest capitalized but not recognized while on non-accrual, is recognized prospectively on the effective yield basis through maturity of the loan when placed back on accrual status, to the extent deemed collectible by management. As of June 30, 2020, the Company did not have any loans on non-accrual status. Loan origination fees are capitalized and the Company accretes such amounts as interest income over the respective term of the loan or security. Upon the prepayment of a loan or security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. Upfront structuring fees are recorded as fee income when earned. The Company records prepayment premiums on loans and securities as fee income when it receives such amounts.\nFor financial reporting purposes, the Merger was treated as a recapitalization of PWAY followed by the reverse acquisition of TPIC by PWAY for a purchase price equivalent to the fair value of TPIC's net assets.\nOur primary operating expenses will be the payment of advisory fees and other expenses under the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser (the \"Investment Advisory Agreement\"). The advisory fees will compensate our Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The standard is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the optional guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. The Company did not utilize the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nWe have adopted an opt in\u201d distribution reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, when we make a distribution, stockholders will receive distributions in cash unless they specifically opt in\u201d to the distribution reinvestment plan so as to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to U.S. stockholders.\nIf the Company fails to satisfy the annual distribution requirement or otherwise fails to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, it would be subject to tax on all of its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates. The Company would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would it be required to make distributions. Distributions would generally be taxable to the Company's individual and other non-corporate taxable stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for the reduced maximum rate applicable to qualified dividend income to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits, provided certain holding period and other requirements are met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributions would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. To qualify again to be taxed as a RIC in a subsequent year, the Company would be required to distribute to its shareholders its accumulated earnings and profits attributable to non-RIC years. In addition, if the Company failed to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, then, in order to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year, it would be required to elect to recognize and pay tax on any net built-in gain (the excess of aggregate gain, including items of income, over aggregate loss that would have been realized if we had been liquidated) or, alternatively, be subject to taxation on such built-in gain recognized for a period of five years.\n\nResults of Operations\nDealer Manager Agreement\nEffective August 5, 2020, we amended our articles of incorporation to change our name to Prospect Flexible Income Fund, Inc. In addition, on August 5, 2020, we amended and restated our bylaws to reflect the change of our corporate name.\nFor the period beginning July 1, 2020 and ending August 27, 2020, the Company sold 17,295 shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of $156,000 and issued 15,959 shares pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan in the amount of $131,658.\n \u2022 federal, state and local taxes; \nAmounts due from the Adviser are for amounts waived under the ELA (as such term is defined in Note 4) and amounts due to the Adviser are for base management fees, incentive fees, operating expenses paid on our behalf and offering and organization expenses paid on our behalf. The due from and due to Adviser balances are presented net on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of June 30, 2020 and are presented gross on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of June 30, 2019. All balances due from and to the Adviser are settled quarterly.\nPursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay the Adviser a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee payable to the Adviser and any incentive fees it earns will ultimately be borne by our stockholders.\nIn accordance with the accounting and presentation for reverse acquisitions, the historical financial statements of the Company, prior to the date of the Merger reflect the financial positions and results of operations of PWAY, with the results of operations of TPIC being included commencing on April 1, 2019. Effective with the completion of the Merger, TPIC, changed its fiscal year end to be the last day of June consistent with PWAY's fiscal year.\nWe have engaged Triton Pacific Securities, LLC (the \"Dealer Manager\") to serve as the dealer manager for our offering. The dealer manager is not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of shares but will use its best efforts to sell the shares offered.\nThe Company has entered into an expense limitation agreement with the Adviser pursuant to which the Adviser, in its sole discretion,\nStructured Credit Related Risk\nExpenses\nSome of our loans and other investments may have contractual payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest or dividends. PIK income computed at the contractual rate is accrued into income and reflected as receivable up to the capitalization date. PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities. When additional securities are received, they typically have the same terms, including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued. On these payment dates, we capitalize the accrued interest (reflecting such amounts in the basis as additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. At the point that we believe PIK is not fully expected to be realized, the PIK investment will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are reversed from the related receivable through interest or dividend income, respectively. We do not reverse previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends. Upon capitalization, PIK is subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments. PIK investments on non-accrual status are restored to accrual status if we believe that PIK is expected to be realized.\nPortfolio Holdings\nWe will reimburse our Administrator for the administrative expenses necessary for its performance of services to us. Such costs will be reasonably allocated to us on the basis of assets, revenues, time records or other reasonable methods. However, such reimbursement is made in an amount equal to the lower of the Administrator's actual costs or the amount that we would be required to pay for comparable administrative services in the same geographic location. We will not reimburse our Administrator for any services for which it receives a separate fee or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of our Administrator.\nthe year. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income, it accrues excise taxes, if any, on estimated excess taxable income. As of June 30, 2020, the Company does not expect to have any excise tax due for the 2020 calendar year. Thus, the Company has not accrued any excise tax for this period.\nIf any of our contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs may increase under any new agreements that we enter into as replacements. We would also likely incur expenses in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. Any new investment advisory agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders.\nExpense Limitation Agreement with the Adviser\nIn connection with that determination, the Adviser provides the Company's board of directors with portfolio company valuations which are based on relevant inputs which may include indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by third-party valuation services.\n \u2022 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the preferred return but is less than or equal to 1.875% in any calendar quarter (7.5% annualized). We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the preferred return but is less than or equal to 1.875%) as the catch-up.\u201d The effect of the catch-up\u201d provision is that, if our pre-incentive fee net investment income reaches 1.875% in any calendar quarter, our Adviser will receive 20.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a preferred return did not apply. \n 1. Each portfolio company or investment is reviewed by investment professionals of the Adviser with the independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors. \nOur non-CLO investments are valued utilizing broker quotes, yield technique, enterprise value ( EV\u201d) technique, net asset value technique, liquidation technique, discounted cash flow technique, or a combination of techniques, as appropriate. The yield technique uses loan spreads for loans and other relevant information implied by market data involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Under the EV technique, the EV of a portfolio company is first determined and allocated over the portfolio company's securities in order of their preference relative to one another (i.e., waterfall\u201d allocation). To determine the EV, we\nOn March 31, 2019, Pathway Capital Opportunity Fund, Inc. ( PWAY\u201d) merged with and into us (the Merger\u201d). As the combined surviving company, we were renamed as TP Flexible Income Fund, Inc. (we were formerly known as Triton Pacific Investment Corporation, Inc. ( TPIC\u201d)). In connection with the Merger, Prospect Flexible Income Management, LLC (the \"Adviser\"), an affiliate of PWAY, became our investment adviser, and Prospect Administration LLC (the \"Administrator\" or \"Prospect Administration\"), an affiliate of the Adviser, became our administrator. Although PWAY merged with and into us, PWAY is considered the accounting survivor of the Merger and its historical financial statements are included and discussed herein and in other applicable reports that we file with the SEC.\n \u2022 all other expenses incurred by either our Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments to our Administrator under the Administration Agreement (as defined herein) that will be based upon our allocable portion of its overhead and other expenses incurred in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief executive officer, chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staffs.

The Tender Offer is for cash at a price equal to the net offering price per share determined as of July 10, 2020 ( Purchase Price\u201d). The offer expired at 4:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on July 8, 2020 and a total of 65,266 shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the offer. In accordance with the terms of the offer, the Company purchased 28,786 shares validly tendered and not withdrawn at a price equal to $8.25 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $237,488.\nMerger\nOperating Expenses\nLevel 3. Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nOn August 6, 2020, we amended our dealer manager agreement with our dealer manager to reflect a change to the upfront sales load paid to our dealer manager in connection with the sale of our Class A Shares. Under the amended dealer manager agreement, we will pay our dealer manager an upfront sales load of up to 9% of the gross proceeds received on Class A Shares sold in our offering all or a portion of which may be paid to selected broker-dealers and financial representatives. The upfront sales load consists of upfront selling commissions of up to 6.0% of the gross proceeds of Class A Shares sold in our offering and a dealer\nLevel 2. Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in an inactive market, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.\n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; \nDealer Manager Agreement\nCritical Accounting Policies\nDue from and to Adviser\nWe do not control\u201d any of our portfolio companies, as defined in the 1940 Act. We are an affiliate of Injured Workers Pharmacy, LLC (held through ACON IWP Investors I, L.L.C.). In general, under the 1940 Act, we would be presumed to control\u201d a portfolio company if we owned 25% or more of its voting securities and would be an affiliate\u201d of a portfolio company if we owned 5% or more of its voting securities.\nOffering Costs and Expenses\nOn April 8, 2020, in connection with the outbreak of the Wuhan Virus pandemic, the SEC issued an Order Under Sections 6(c), 17(d), 38(a) and 57(i) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 17d-1 Thereunder Granting Exemptions from Specified Provisions of the Investment Company Act and Certain Rules Thereunder, the 1940 Act Release No. 33837 (Apr. 8, 2020) (the April 2020 Order\u201d), which provides exemptions from certain requirements of the 1940 Act. Section II of the April 2020 Order (i) affords BDCs greater flexibility in calculating asset coverage ratios for purposes of the 1940 Act asset coverage requirements, (ii) requires a BDC's board of directors, including a required majority of such board, as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act, to determine that the issuance or sale of covered senior securities is permitted by this April 2020 Order and is in the best interests of the BDC and its stockholders, (iii) requires prior disclosure on Form 8-K of an election to rely on Section II of the April 2020 Order, and (iv) includes certain limitations on new investments, among other requirements detailed in the April 2020 Order. The Company has not taken advantage of the relief provided by the April 2020 Order.\nOverview\nCommon Shares\nThe interest and credit facility expense for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively, were $603,263, $58,638 and $67,195.\nTotal operating expenses before expense limitation support and waiver of offering costs totaled $3,484,040, $2,943,931 and $1,984,880 for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. These operating expenses consisted primarily of interest and credit facility expense, amortization of offering costs, base management fees, administrator costs, legal expense, audit and tax expense, and adviser shared service expense.\nWhile we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of the tax. In that event, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.\nDividends and Distributions\nImpact of the novel coronavirus (the \"Wuhan Virus\") pandemic\nSubordinated Incentive Fee on Income. The first part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the subordinated incentive fee on income, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based upon our pre-incentive fee net investment income\u201d for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For purposes of this fee, pre-incentive fee net investment income\u201d means interest income, dividend income and distribution cash flows from equity investments and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses reimbursed under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the organization and offering expenses and incentive fees on income and capital gains). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The subordinated incentive fee on income is subject to a quarterly fixed preferred return to investors, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, of 1.5% (6.0% annualized), subject to a catch up\u201d feature. Operating expenses are included in the calculation of the subordinated incentive fee on income.\n\nInterest rate risk represents a change in interest rates, which could result in an adverse change in the fair value of an interest-bearing financial instrument.\nInterest Rate Risk\n \u2022 costs of proxy statements, stockholders' reports and notices; \nOn March 31, 2019, we entered into the Administration Agreement with Prospect Administration, which was amended and restated effective as of June 17, 2019, pursuant to which Prospect Administration furnishes us with administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. The Administration Agreement with Prospect Administration initially became effective upon consummation of the Merger. We reimburse Prospect Administration for its allocable portion of overhead incurred by Prospect Administration in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and its allocable portion of the costs of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and her staff. We have engaged Bank of New York Mellon and affiliated entities to act as our custodian. We have also contracted with Phoenix American Financial Services to act as our transfer agent, plan administrator, distribution paying agent and registrar.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPurchase Price Allocation\nGains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated by using the specific identification method. The Company measures realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized.\nNet Realized Gains/Losses from Investments\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nOn September 2, 2014, PWAY entered into an administration agreement with Prospect Administration LLC, an affiliate of the Adviser and in which certain members of our senior management hold an equity interest and act as principals. Pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger as amended and restated, between TPIC and PWAY, Prospect Administration LLC became the administrator for the Company pursuant to an administrative agreement, as amended and restated as of June 17, 2019 (the \"Administration Agreement\"). The Administrator performs, oversees and arranges for the performance of administrative services necessary for the operation of the Company. These services include, but are not limited to, accounting, finance and legal services. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, the Company reimburses the Administrator for the Company's actual and allocable portion of expenses and overhead incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the Company's allocable portion of the costs of its Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and her staff. For the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 administrative costs incurred by the Company and PWAY to the Administrator were $596,030, $442,047 and $357,995, respectively. As of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, $122,384 and $341,235, respectively, was payable to the Administrator by the Company.\nDuring the three months and twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we drew an additional $0 and $15,500,000, respectively, on our Credit Facility (as defined herein) for a total of $21,000,000 outstanding on our credit facility as of June 30, 2020. See \"Credit Facility\".\n\nInvestments\n", "item_7_text": "Consistent with tax free business combinations of investment companies, for financial reporting purposes, the reverse merger accounting was recorded at fair value; however, the cost basis of the investments received from TPIC was carried forward to align ongoing financial reporting of the Company's realized and unrealized gains and losses with amounts distributable to shareholders\nInvestment Advisory Agreement\nWe will pay our Adviser a subordinated incentive fee on income for each calendar quarter as follows:\nWe will generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of our offering, and from cash flows from fees (such as management fees), interest and dividends earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. Our primary use of funds will be investments in companies, and payments of our expenses and distributions to holders of our common stock.\nSales of Common Stock\nOn March 27, 2014, we and our Former Adviser entered into an Expense Reimbursement Agreement. The Expense Reimbursement Agreement was amended and restated effective April 5, 2018. Under the Expense Reimbursement Agreement, as amended, our Former Adviser, in consultation with the Company, could pay up to 100% of both our organizational and offering expenses and our operating expenses, all as determined by us and our Former Adviser. The Expense Reimbursement Agreement stated that until the net proceeds to us from our offering are at least $25 million, our Former Adviser could pay up to 100% of both our organizational and offering expenses and our operating expenses. After we received at least $25 million in net proceeds from our offering, our Former Adviser could, with our consent, continue to make expense support payments to us in such amounts as was acceptable to us and our Former Adviser. The Expense Reimbursement Agreement terminated on December 31, 2018. Our Former Adviser had agreed to reimburse a total of $5,292,192 as of December 31, 2018. However, as part of the Merger, the Former Adviser agreed to waive any amounts owed to it under the Expense Reimbursement Agreement.\nNet change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments reflects the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio. For the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively, net change in unrealized gains (losses) totaled $(1,332,402), $150,069 and $(704,926), respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2020, the fair value of our investments was negatively impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the Wuhan Virus pandemic and its effect on market yields and fundamental portfolio company performance. For more information, see Valuation of Portfolio Investments\u201d.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2020, PIK interest included in interest income totaled $10,273. There was no PIK interest for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. Investment income for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, increased due to the increase in assets and investments as a result of the Merger.\nOur Adviser\n 3. The audit committee of our board of directors (the Audit Committee\u201d) reviews and discusses with the independent valuation firms the valuation reports, and then makes a recommendation to our board of directors of the value for each investment. \nWe follow guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820\u201d), which classifies the inputs used to measure fair values into the following hierarchy:\nThe Adviser shared service expense for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively, were $0, $19,028 and $216,184.\nThe following table shows the composition of our investment portfolio by level of control as of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019:\nWe will generally source our investments primarily through our Adviser. We believe the investment management team of our Adviser has a significant amount of experience in the credit business, including originating, underwriting, principal investing and loan structuring. Our Adviser, through Prospect Capital Management, has access to 95 professionals, 42 of whom perform investment advisory functions.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the Wuhan Virus a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. As of the year ended June 30, 2020, and subsequent to June 30, 2020, the Wuhan Virus pandemic has had a significant impact on the U.S. and global economy and on us. We have experienced an increase in unrealized depreciation of our investment portfolio due to decreases in fair value of its investments attributable to the impact of the Wuhan Virus pandemic on the markets.\nOn May 14, 2020, the Company decreased its offering price from $11.38 per share to $8.78 per share. The decrease in the offering price is effective for all closings occurring on or after May 15, 2020. We will sell our shares on a continuous basis at a price of $8.78 per share. On August 12, 2020, our Board of Directors determined to change the public offering price per share of our Class A shares of common stock from $8.78 per share to $9.03 per share. The change in the public offering price will be effective as of August 12, 2020 and first applied to subscriptions in good order received on or after August 12, 2020. In addition, on August 26, 2020, the Company increased its offering price from $9.03 per share to $9.33 per share. The increase in the offering price is effective for all closings occurring on or after August 26, 2020. To the extent our net asset value increases, we will sell at a price necessary to ensure that shares are not sold at a price per share, after deduction of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, that is below our net asset value per share. In connection with each closing, our board of directors or a committee thereof is required, within 48 hours of the time that each closing and sale is made, to make the determination that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price per share which, after deducting upfront selling commissions, if any, is below the then-current net asset value per share of the applicable class. Promptly following any such adjustment to the offering price per share, we will file a prospectus supplement with the SEC disclosing the adjusted offering price, and we appropriately publish the updated information.\nBase Management Fee. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% (0.4375% quarterly) of our average total assets, which includes any borrowings for investment purposes. For the first quarter of our operations following the Merger, the base management fee was calculated based on the average value of our total assets as of the date of the Investment Advisory Agreement and at the end of the calendar quarter in which the date of the Investment Advisory Agreement fell, and was appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the then current calendar quarter. Subsequently, the base management fee\nAs a BDC, we are permitted under the 1940 Act to borrow funds to finance portfolio investments. To enhance our opportunity for gain, we intend to employ leverage as market conditions permit. At the 2019 Annual Meeting, TPIC's stockholders approved a proposal allowing us to modify our asset coverage ratio requirement from 200% to 150%. As a result, we are allowed to increase our leverage capacity effective as of March 16, 2019. The use of leverage, although it may increase returns, may also increase the risk of loss to our investors, particularly if the level of our leverage is high and the value of our investments declines.\n \u2022 all other expenses incurred by our Adviser, in performing its obligations, subject to the limitations included in the Investment Advisory Agreement; and \nRelated Party Transactions\nWe entered into a license agreement with an affiliate of our Adviser, pursuant to which the affiliate granted us a non-exclusive, royalty free license to use the Prospect\u201d name. Under this license agreement, we have the right to use such name for so long as our Adviser or another affiliate of Prospect Capital Management is our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the Prospect\u201d name or logo.\nThe North American Securities Administrators Association, in its Omnibus Guidelines Statement of Policy adopted on March 29, 1992 and as amended on May 7, 2007 and from time to time, requires that our sponsor and its affiliates have an aggregate financial net worth, exclusive of home, automobile and home furnishings, of 5% of the first $20,000 of both the gross amount of securities currently being offered and the gross amount of any originally issued direct participation program sold by our sponsor and its affiliates within the last 12 months, plus 1% of all amounts in excess of the first $20,000. Based on these requirements, our sponsor and its affiliates have an aggregate net worth in excess of those amounts required by the Omnibus Guidelines Statement of Policy.\nIn all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment.\nAllocation of Expenses\nWe are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act\u201d). Our investment objective is to generate current income and, as a secondary objective, capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. We intend to meet our investment objective by primarily lending to and investing in the debt of privately-owned U.S. middle market companies, which we define as companies with annual revenue between $50 million and $2.5 billion. We have elected and intend to continue to qualify annually to be taxed for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (\"RIC\") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\").\nDividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date. The amount, if any, to be paid as a monthly dividend or distribution is approved by our board of directors quarterly and generally depends on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board deems relevant from time to time. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The standard will modify the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, or adding certain disclosures. ASU No. 2018-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted upon issuance of this ASU. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company determines the fair value of its investment portfolio each quarter. The fair values of the Company's investments are determined in good faith by the Company's board of directors. The Company's board of directors is solely responsible for the valuation of the Company's portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the Company's valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process.\nOur investments in CLOs are classified as Level 3 fair value measured securities under ASC 820 and are valued using a discounted multi-path cash flow model. The CLO structures are analyzed to identify the risk exposures and to determine an appropriate call date (i.e., expected maturity). These risk factors are sensitized in the multi-path cash flow model using Monte Carlo simulations, which is a simulation used to model the probability of different outcomes, to generate probability-weighted (i.e., multi-path) cash flows from the underlying assets and liabilities. These cash flows are discounted using appropriate market discount rates, and relevant data in the CLO market as well as certain benchmark credit indices are considered, to determine the value of each CLO investment. In addition, we generate a single-path cash flow utilizing our best estimate of expected cash receipts, and assess the reasonableness of the implied discount rate that would be effective for the value derived from the multi-path cash flows. We are not responsible for and have no influence over the asset management of the portfolios underlying the CLO investments we hold, as those portfolios are managed by non-affiliated third-party CLO collateral managers. The main risk factors are default risk, prepayment risk, interest rate risk, downgrade risk, and credit spread risk.\nWe will bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to:\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d), and intends to continue to comply with the requirements of the Code applicable to RICs. As a RIC, the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable income and intends to distribute (or retain through a deemed distribution) all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain to stockholders; therefore, the Company has made no provision for income taxes. The character of income and gains that the Company will distribute is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP. Book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividends and distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified to paid-in capital.\n\n \u2022 fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws; \nEffective March 31, 2019, TPIC and PWAY entered into a tax free business combination. Concurrent with the Merger, TPIC, the legal acquirer, was renamed Prospect Flexible Income Fund, Inc. (formerly known as TP Flexible Income Fund, Inc.) As a result of the Merger the Company issued 775,193 shares of the Company's common stock to the former shareholders of PWAY and all shares of PWAY were retired.\nPursuant to the expense limitation support payment (discussed below), the sponsor reimbursed the Company $(708,464), $(309,881) and $(748,696) for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2020, the U.S. loan market exhibited a heightened level of volatility. While U.S. loan prices remained relatively stable throughout February 2020, the increasingly negative sentiment associated with the economic ramifications of the rapid spread of Wuhan Virus led to a precipitous decline in U.S. loan prices in the quarter ended March 31, 2020. During quarter end June 30, 2020, U.S. loan prices rebounded and as a result, our portfolio increased in value during the three months ended June 30, 2020.\nValuation of Other Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nCertain officers and directors of the Company are also officers and directors of the Adviser and its affiliates. There were no fees paid to the independent directors of the Company as the Company did not exceed the minimum net asset value required (i.e., greater than $100 million) to receive a fee for the year ended June 30, 2020. The officers do not receive any direct compensation from the Company.\nEquity Issuances\nWe generate revenue in the form of dividends, interest and capital gains on the debt securities, equity interests and CLOs that we hold. In addition, we may generate revenue from our portfolio companies in the form of commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees and performance-based fees. Any such fees will be recognized as earned.\nThe Dealer Manager is not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of shares but will use its best efforts to sell the shares offered. The minimum investment in shares of our common stock is $5,000.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nThe cost, fair value and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of the investments of TPIC as of the date of the Merger, was as follows:\nContractual Obligations\nWe record origination expenses related to our Revolving Credit Facility as deferred financing costs. These expenses are deferred and amortized as part of interest expense using the straight-line method over the stated life of the obligation of our Revolving Credit Facility. (See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion).\nWe intend to primarily lend to and invest in the debt of privately-owned U.S. middle market companies. We may on occasion invest in smaller or larger companies if an attractive opportunity presents itself, especially when there are dislocations in the capital markets. We expect to focus primarily on making investments in syndicated senior secured first lien loans, syndicated senior secured second lien loans, and to a lesser extent, subordinated debt, of middle market companies in a broad range of industries. Syndicated secured loans refer to commercial loans provided by a group of lenders that are structured, arranged, and administered by one or several commercial or investment banks, known as arrangers. These loans are then sold (or syndicated) to other banks or institutional investors. Syndicated secured loans may have a first priority lien on a borrower's assets (i.e., senior secured first lien loans), a second priority lien on a borrower's assets (i.e., senior secured second lien loans), or a lower lien or unsecured position on the borrower's assets (i.e., subordinated debt). We expect our target credit investments will typically have initial maturities between three and ten years and generally range in size between $1 million and $100 million, although the investment size will vary with the size of our capital base. We expect that the majority of our debt investments will bear interest at floating interest rates, but our portfolio may also include fixed-rate investments. We also expect to make our investments directly through the primary issuance by the borrower or in the secondary market.\nOn August 12, 2020, the Company increased its offering price from $8.78 per share to $9.03 per share. The increase in the offering price is effective for all closings occurring on or after August 12, 2020. In addition, on August 26, 2020, the Company increased its offering price from $9.03 per share to $9.33 per share. The increase in the offering price is effective for all closings occurring on or after August 26, 2020.\nInvestment Advisory Fees\nmanager fee of up to 3.0% of the gross offering proceeds of Class A Shares sold in our offering.

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.\nPWAY as the accounting acquirer acquired 32% of the voting interests of TPIC. The below table summarizes the purchase price allocation from TPIC:\n \u2022 investment advisory fees; \nOffering Price\nCost and Expenses\n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; \n \u2022 fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence reviews of prospective investments; \nmay waive a portion or all of the investment advisory fees that it is entitled to receive under the Investment Advisory Agreement\nThe extent of the impact of the Wuhan Virus pandemic on the financial performance of our current and future investments will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the virus, related advisories and restrictions, and the health of the financial markets and economy, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. To the extent our portfolio companies are adversely impacted by the effects of the Wuhan Virus pandemic, it may have a material adverse impact on its future net investment income, the fair value of its portfolio investments, its financial condition and the results of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies.\nRevenues\nin order to limit the Company's operating expenses to an annual rate, expressed as a percentage of the Company's average quarterly\nOur Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company and is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Our Adviser is controlled by Prospect Capital Management, who owns a majority of its voting units. Mr. Eliasek is the principal officer of the Adviser.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nNet Unrealized Gains/Losses on Investments\nmay or may not make certain elections under the Tax Act that could materially increase their taxable earnings and profits. Any such increase in the taxable earnings and profits of a portfolio company may result in the characterization of certain distributions sourced from sale proceeds as dividend income, which may increase our distributable taxable income.\nFinancing Costs\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, our operating results were negatively impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the Wuhan Virus pandemic, which has caused severe disruptions in the global economy and negatively impacted the fair value and performance of our investment portfolio. For the year ended June 30, 2020, the resulting changes in net unrealized depreciation on investments were largely due to widening credit spreads as market participants expected a higher yield on similar investments given the significant market volatility generated by the Wuhan Virus pandemic. To a lesser extent, the changes in net unrealized depreciation on investments for the quarter for certain of our portfolio companies also reflected other factors such as specific industry concerns, uncertainty about the duration of business shutdowns and near-term liquidity needs. For additional information concerning the Wuhan Virus pandemic and its potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Part II - Other information, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Risk Factors - The Wuhan Virus pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the global economy, which has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our portfolio companies and our business and operations.\u201d\nThe offering of our common stock represents a continuous offering of our shares. The initial offering of our common stock commenced on September 4, 2012 and terminated on March 1, 2016. On March 17, 2016, we commenced the follow-on offering of our common stock, which follow-on offering is currently ongoing. We intend to file post-effective amendments to our registration statement to allow us to continue our offering for three years. On September 26, 2019, we filed with the SEC an amendment to our registration statement, which was declared effective September 26, 2019, in order to continue our continuous public offering of our shares.\nAs part of the dividend reinvestment plan, we issued 7,087, 7,095 and 11,449 shares of our common stock on April 3, 2020, May 1, 2020 and June 5, 2020, respectively. On July 6, 2020 we issued 7,120 shares of our common stock in connection with the dividend reinvestment plan for June 2020 distributions.\nLicense Agreement\nBelow is the asset coverage for the twelve month ended June 30, 2020 and the year ended June 30, 2019.\nIn the Merger, common shareholders of PWAY received newly-issued common shares in the Company having an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset value of their holdings of PWAY Class A and/or PWAY Class I common shares, as applicable, as determined at the close of business on March 27, 2019, as permitted by the Merger Agreement. The differences in net asset value between March 27, 2019 and March 31, 2019 were not material. Relevant details pertaining to the Merger are as follows:\nThe legal expenses for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively, were $175,811, $833,849 and $49,565. The legal expenses for the year ended June 30, 2019 were higher due to the costs incurred in order to close the Merger.\n \u2022 20.0% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 1.875% in any calendar quarter (7.5% annualized) will be payable to our Adviser. This reflects that once the preferred return is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 20.0% of all pre-incentive fee net investment income thereafter will be allocated to our Adviser.  Capital Gains Incentive Fee. The second part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the capital gains incentive fee, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20.00% of our realized capital gains for the calendar year, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation at the end of such year. In determining the capital gains incentive fee payable to the Adviser, we calculate the aggregate realized capital gains, aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, as applicable, with respect to each investment that has been in our portfolio. For the purpose of this calculation, an investment\u201d is defined as the total of all rights and claims which may be asserted against a portfolio company arising from our participation in the debt, equity, and other financial instruments issued by that company. Aggregate realized capital gains, if any, equal the sum of the differences between the aggregate net sales price of each investment and the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment when sold or otherwise disposed. Aggregate realized capital losses equal the sum of the amounts by which the aggregate net sales price of each investment is less than the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment when sold or otherwise disposed. Aggregate unrealized capital depreciation equals the sum of the differences, if negative, between the aggregate valuation of each investment and the aggregate amortized cost basis of such investment as of the applicable calendar year-end. At the end of the applicable calendar year, the amount of capital gains that serves as the basis for our calculation of the capital gains incentive fee involves netting aggregate realized capital gains against aggregate realized capital losses on a since-inception basis and then reducing this amount by the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation. If this number is positive, then the capital gains incentive fee payable is equal to 20.00% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains incentive fees paid since inception. Operating expenses are not taken into account when determining capital gains incentive fees.\nOur board of directors has authorized, and has declared, cash distributions on our common stock on a monthly basis since the second quarter of 2015 (in our capacity as TPIC). The amount of each such distribution is subject to our board of directors' discretion and applicable legal restrictions related to the payment of distributions. We calculate each stockholder's specific distribution amount for the month using record and declaration dates, and distributions will begin to accrue on the date we accept subscriptions for shares of our common stock. From time to time, we may also pay interim distributions at the discretion of our board of directors. Each year a statement on Internal Revenue Service Form 1099-DIV (or any successor form) identifying the source of the distribution (i.e.,(i) paid from investment company taxable income, which is generally our net ordinary income plus our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital gains, (ii) paid from net capital gain on the sale\nCLO investments may be riskier and less transparent to us than direct investments in underlying companies. CLOs typically will have no significant assets other than their underlying senior secured loans. Therefore, payments on CLO investments are and will be payable solely from the cash flows from such senior secured loans.\nOn and effective August 5, 2020, we changed our name to Prospect Flexible Income Fund, Inc. from TP Flexible Income Fund, Inc. by filing Articles of Amendment to our Fourth Articles of Amendment and Restatement, as amended and supplemented.\nIn connection with the Merger, PWAY incurred certain associated costs and expenses of approximately $731,000, of which $709,000 of these costs and expenses were expensed by PWAY and $22,000 were expensed by the Company. In connection with the Merger, TPIC incurred certain associated costs and expenses of approximately $682,000, of which $636,000 were expensed by TPIC and $46,000 were expensed by the Company.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs of June 30, 2020, our investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $36,663,703, consisted of interests in 27 portfolio companies and 24 structured subordinated notes. The following table presents certain selected information regarding our portfolio composition and weighted average yields as of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019:\nName Change\nWe have entered into certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. On March 31, 2019, we entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with Prospect Flexible Income Management, LLC in accordance with the 1940 Act. The Investment Advisory Agreement became effective upon consummation of the Merger. Prospect Flexible Income Management,\nWe seek to be a long-term investor with our portfolio companies. During the three months and twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we purchased investment securities (excluding short-term securities) of $1,675,000 and $23,678,340, respectively. During the same three month and twelve month period, sales and redemptions of investment securities (excluding short-term securities) were $2,286,635 and $8,271,306, respectively, resulting in a total net portfolio decline of ($611,634) for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and a total net portfolio growth of $15,407,034 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020.\nThe Company and its Adviser have entered into a dealer manager agreement with Triton Pacific Securities, LLC pursuant to which the Company will pay the Dealer Manager a fee of up to 9.0% of gross proceeds raised in the Company's offering, some of which will be re-allowed to other participating broker-dealers. In addition to the upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees, the Adviser may pay the Dealer Manager a fee (the \"Additional Selling Commissions\") equal to no more than 1.0% of the net asset value per share per year. The Dealer Manager will reallow all or a portion of the Additional Selling Commissions to participating broker-dealers. The Dealer Manager is an affiliated entity of the Former Adviser and is partially owned by one of our directors, Craig Faggen.\nInvestment Transactions\n \u2022 federal and state registration fees; \nPrepayment Risk\nOn December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), which significantly changed the Code, including a reduction in the corporate income tax rate, a new limitation on the deductibility of interest expense, and significant changes to the taxation of income earned from foreign sources and foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act also authorizes the IRS to issue regulations with respect to the new provisions. We cannot predict how the changes in the Tax Act, or regulations or other guidance issued under it, might affect us, our business or the business of our portfolio companies. However, our portfolio companies\nWe may borrow funds to make investments at any time, including before we have fully invested the proceeds of our offering, to the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities, or if our board of directors determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. We have not yet decided, however, whether, and to what extent, we will finance portfolio investments using debt. We do not currently anticipate issuing any preferred stock.\nOn August 14, 2020, the Company funded $45,455 of the total $85,227 delayed draw term loan commitment for our investment in Amerilife Holdings, LLC portfolio company.\nThe types of factors that are taken into account in fair value determination include, as relevant, market changes in expected returns for similar investments, performance improvement or deterioration, security covenants, call protection provisions, and information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the issuer's ability to make payments and its earnings and cash flows, the principal markets in which the issuer does business, publicly available financial ratios of peer companies, comparisons to traded securities, enterprise values, and other relevant factors.\nThe terms FLEX,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d mean Prospect Flexible Income Fund, Inc. (formerly known as TP Flexible Income Fund, Inc.) unless the context specifically requires otherwise.\nIn accordance with the 1940 Act, the Company is currently only allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage,\u201d as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 150% after such borrowing. Asset coverage\u201d generally refers to a company's total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities,\u201d as defined in the 1940 Act, divided by total senior securities representing indebtedness and, if applicable, preferred stock. Senior securities\u201d for this purpose includes borrowings from banks or other lenders, debt securities and preferred stock.\n \u2022 legal, accounting and other costs associated with structuring, negotiating, documenting and completing our investment transactions; \n \u2022 transfer agent and custodial fees; \n 4. Our board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of such investments in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Adviser, the respective independent valuation firms and the Audit Committee. \nWhen market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, our board of directors has approved a multi-step valuation process for each quarter, as described below, and such investments are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy:\nNet Investment Income\nRepurchase Offer\nInvestment Activity\nis payable quarterly in arrears, and is calculated based on the average value of our total assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and is appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the then current calendar quarter. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter is appropriately pro-rated. At the Adviser's option, the base management fee for any period may be deferred, without interest thereon, and paid to the Adviser at any time subsequent to any such deferral as the Adviser determines.\nWe have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with our Adviser. We will pay our Adviser a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components - a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee payable to the Adviser and any incentive fees it earns will ultimately be borne by our stockholders. See -Investment Advisory Fees.\u201d\nLLC serves as our investment adviser in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. Payments under the Investment Advisory Agreement in each reporting period will consist of (i) a management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our gross assets and (ii) income and capital gains incentive fees based on our performance.\nInterest income from investments in Structured Subordinated Notes (typically preferred shares, income notes or subordinated notes of CLO funds) is recorded based on an estimation of an effective yield to expected maturity utilizing assumed future cash flows in accordance with ASC 325-40, Beneficial Interest in the Securitized Financial Assets. The Company monitors the expected cash inflows from CLO equity investments, including the expected residual payments, and the estimated effective yield is determined and updated periodically. In accordance with ASC 325-40, Beneficial Interest in Securitized Financial Assets, investments in CLOs are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d). When the Company determines that a CLO has OTTI, the amortized cost basis of the CLO is written down to its fair value as of the date of the determination based on events and information evaluated and that write-down is recognized as a realized loss.\nMany of our debt investments allow for prepayment of principal without penalty. Downward changes in interest rates may cause prepayments to occur at a faster than expected rate, thereby effectively shortening the maturity of the security and making us less likely to fully earn all of the expected income of that security and reinvesting in a lower yielding instrument.\nWe measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized.\nAdministration Agreement\nLiquidity risk represents the possibility that we may not be able to rapidly adjust the size of our investment positions in times of high volatility and financial stress at a reasonable price.\nPaid-In-Kind Interest\nMarket risk represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the fair value of the financial instrument.\nCredit Risk\nOther than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities.\nThe cost of portfolio management software is initially borne by the Company, which then allocates to PSEC its proportional share of such expense. During the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred $0, $11,058 and $23,603, respectively, in expenses related to the portfolio management software that is attributable to PSEC. PSEC reimburses the Company for these expenses and included them as part of general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, $0 of expense is due from PSEC.\nExpense Reimbursement Agreement with our Former Adviser\nConcurrently with the closing of the Merger, we entered into an Expense Limitation Agreement with our Adviser (the ELA\u201d). Pursuant to the ELA, our Adviser, in its sole discretion, may waive a portion or all of the investment advisory fees that it is entitled to receive pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement in order to limit our Operating Expenses (as defined below) to an annual rate, expressed as a percentage of our average quarterly net assets, equal to 8.00% (the Annual Limit\u201d). For purposes of the ELA, the term Operating Expenses\u201d with respect to the Company, is defined to include all expenses necessary or appropriate for the operation of the Company, including but not limited to our Adviser's base management fee, any and all costs and expenses that qualify as line item organization and offering\u201d expenses in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as the same are filed with the SEC and other expenses described in the Investment Advisory Agreement, but does not include any portfolio transaction or other investment-related costs (including brokerage commissions, dealer and underwriter spreads, prime broker fees and expenses and dividend expenses related to short sales), interest expenses and other financing costs, extraordinary expenses and acquired fund fees and expenses. Upfront shareholder transaction expenses (such as sales commissions, dealer manager fees, and similar expenses) are not Operating Expenses. On April 30, 2020, the Company's board of directors approved extending the Expense Limitation Agreement for an additional 12-month term ending on April 30, 2021\n\ntypically use a market (multiples) valuation approach that considers relevant and applicable market trading data of guideline public companies, transaction metrics from precedent merger and acquisitions transactions, and/or a discounted cash flow technique. The net asset value technique, an income approach, is used to derive a value of an underlying investment by dividing a relevant earnings stream by an appropriate capitalization rate. The liquidation technique is intended to approximate the net recovery value of an investment based on, among other things, assumptions regarding liquidation proceeds based on a hypothetical liquidation of a portfolio company's assets. The discounted cash flow technique converts future cash flows or earnings to a range of fair values from which a single estimate may be derived utilizing an appropriate discount rate. The fair value measurement is based on the net present value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts.\nOur investments in bonds and loans are classified as Level 3 fair value measured securities under ASC 820.\nCertain members of our senior management hold an equity interest in our Adviser. Members of our senior management also serve as principals of other investment managers affiliated with our Adviser that do and may in the future manage investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles with investment objectives similar to ours.\nNet increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations per share is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period presented. In accordance with ASC 946, convertible securities are not considered in the calculation of net asset value per share. As of June 30, 2020, there were no issued convertible securities.\nLiquidity Risk\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe expect to dynamically allocate our assets in varying types of investments based on our analysis of the credit markets, which may result in our portfolio becoming more concentrated in particular types of credit instruments (such as senior secured loans) and less invested in other types of credit instruments. The loans in which we intend to invest are often rated by a nationally recognized ratings organization, and generally carry a rating below investment grade (rated lower than Baa3\u201d by Moody's Investors Service or lower than BBB-\u201d by Standard & Poor's Corporation - also known as high yield\u201d or junk bonds\u201d). However, we may also invest in non-rated debt securities.\nThe table below describes investments by industry classification and enumerates the percentage, by fair value, of the total portfolio assets in such industries as of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019:\n \u2022 corporate and organizational expenses relating to offerings of our common stock, subject to limitations included in the investment advisory and management services agreement; \nDebt Issuances and Redemptions\nAt the 2019 Annual Meeting, stockholders approved the application to the Company of the 150% minimum asset coverage ratio set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, and subject to certain additional disclosure requirements and the repurchase obligations described above, the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to the Company was reduced from 200% to 150%, effective as of March 16, 2019.\nSecurities that are publicly-traded are valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market are valued by an independent pricing agent or more than one principal market maker, if available, otherwise a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. We value over-the-counter securities by using the midpoint of the prevailing bid and ask prices from dealers on the date of the relevant period end, which were provided by an independent pricing agent and screened for validity by such service. As a result of the volatility and disruption to the global economy from the Wuhan Virus pandemic (as further discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements), certain market quotations were not deemed to represent fair value.\n \u2022 No incentive fee will be payable to our Adviser in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the preferred return rate of 1.5%. \nRecent Developments\nFederal and State Income Taxes\nOn June 9, 2020, under our share repurchase program, we made an offer to purchase (the \"Tender Offer\") up to the number of shares of our issued and outstanding Class A common stock we can repurchase with the proceeds we receive from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan prior to the expiration of the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer is for cash at a price equal to the net offering price per share determined as of July 10, 2020 ( Purchase Price\u201d). The offer expired at 4:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on July 8, 2020 and a total of 65,266 shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the offer. In accordance with the terms of the offer, the Company purchased 28,786 shares validly tendered and not withdrawn at a price equal to $8.25 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $237,488.\nDuring the period beginning July 1, 2020 and ending August 27, 2020, the Company made 2 investments totaling $1,189,063. During the period beginning July 1, 2020 and ending August 27, 2020, the Company sold 1 investment totaling $446,250.\nLicense Agreement\nOfficers and Directors\n\nDistributions\nThe cost of filing software is initially borne by PSEC, which then allocates to the Company its proportional share of such expense. During the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, PSEC incurred $9,065, $9,390 and $10,162, respectively in expenses related to the filing services that are attributable to the Company. The Company reimburses PSEC for these expenses and includes them as part of general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, $0 and $2,348 was due to PSEC, respectively.\nThe cost of valuation services for CLOs is initially borne by Priority Income Fund, Inc. (\"PRIS\"), which then allocates to the Company its proportional share of such expense. During the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, PRIS incurred $77,212, $61,311 and $60,004, respectively, in expenses related to valuation services that are attributable to the Company. The Company reimburses PRIS for these expenses and includes them as part of valuation services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, $13,516 and $32,314, respectively, of expense is due to PRIS, which is presented as part of due to affiliates on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nof securities, which is our realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net-short term capital losses, and/or (iii) a return of paid-in capital surplus, which is generally a nontaxable distribution) will be mailed to our stockholders. Our distributions may exceed our earnings, especially during the period before we have substantially invested the proceeds from our offering. As a result, a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital for tax purposes.\nTo seek to enhance our returns, we may employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of our Adviser, but in no event will leverage employed exceed the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act.\nOn May 16, 2019, we established a $50 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d) with Royal Bank of Canada, a Canadian chartered bank ( RBC\u201d), acting as administrative agent. In connection with the credit facility, our wholly owned financing subsidiary, Prospect Flexible Funding, LLC (the \"SPV\"), as borrower, and each of the other parties thereto, entered into a Revolving Loan Agreement, dated as of May 16, 2019 (the Loan Agreement\u201d). The SPV is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that was formed to facilitate the transactions under the Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the SPV holds certain of the securities that would otherwise be owned by the Company to be used as the borrowing base and collateral under the Credit Facility. Income paid on these investments is distributed to the Company pursuant to a waterfall after taxes, fees, expenses, and debt service. The lenders under the Credit Facility have a security interest in the investments held by the SPV. Although these investments are owned by the SPV, because the SPV is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, the Company is subject to all of the benefits and risks associated with the Credit Facility and the investments held by the SPV.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 we generated $3,342,618, $1,410,726 and $1,298,317, respectively, in investment income in the form of interest and fees earned on our debt portfolio. Such revenues were primarily cash income and non-cash portions related to the accretion of discounts.\nOn March 12, 2020, we made an offer to the Eligible Stockholders as part of the Special Repurchase Offer (the \"Offer\") to purchase up to 402,917.5 shares of the Company's issued and outstanding Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a price equal to the net asset value per share determined as of April 14, 2020. The Offer expired at 4:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on April 9, 2020 and a total of 52,987 shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. In accordance with the terms of the Offer, the Company purchased all of the shares validly tendered and not withdrawn at a price equal to $8.05 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $426,546.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively, we received proceeds from sales and repayments on unaffiliated investments of $8,271,306, $9,854,278 and $5,320,764, from which we realized gains (losses) of $(1,552,290), $(1,202,884) and $181,008.\nThe Company will incur certain costs and expenses in connection with registering to sell shares of its common stock. These costs and expenses principally relate to certain costs and expenses for advertising and sales, printing and marketing costs, professional and filing fees. Offering costs incurred by the Company are capitalized to deferred offering costs on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and amortized to expense over the 12 month period following such capitalization on a straight line basis. Prior to the Merger, there were offering and organizational costs due to the PWAY's investment adviser (as such term is defined in Note 4).\nAsset Coverage\nThe common shares outstanding, net assets applicable to common shares and NAV per common share outstanding immediately before and after the Merger were as follows:\nWe elected to be treated, beginning with our fiscal year ending December 31, 2012, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under the Code. To maintain RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute at least 90% of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: (i) 98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of our recognized capital gains in excess of recognized capital losses for the one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any ordinary income or capital gains recognized but not distributed in preceding years and on which we paid no federal income tax.\nOn August 4, 2020, we entered into a license agreement with an affiliate of our Adviser, pursuant to which the affiliate granted us a non-exclusive, royalty free license to use the Prospect\u201d name. Under this license agreement, we have the right to use such name for so long as our Adviser or another affiliate of Prospect Capital Management is our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the Prospect\u201d name or logo.\nASC 825, Financial Instruments, specifically ASC 825-10-25, permits an entity to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value (the \"Fair Value Option\"). We have not elected the Fair Value Option to report selected financial assets and financial liabilities.\nManagement has evaluated all known subsequent events through the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements were available to be issued on August 27, 2020 and notes the following:\nCredit risk represents the risk that we would incur if the counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their agreements with us.\n \u2022 the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; \nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which amends the financial instruments impairment guidance so that an entity is required to measure expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As such, an entity will use forward-looking information to estimate credit losses. ASU 2016-13 also amends the guidance in FASB ASC Subtopic No. 325-40, Investments-Other, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets, related to the subsequent measurement of accretable yield recognized as interest income over the life of a beneficial interest in securitized financial assets under the effective yield method. ASU 2016-13 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\n 2. The independent valuation firms prepare independent valuations based on their own independent assessments and issue their reports. \n \u2022 the cost of effecting sales and repurchase of shares of our common stock and other securities; \nThe base management fees for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively, were $708,464, $281,078 and $264,101. The base management fees for the the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, increased as a result of the increase in assets as a result of the Merger.\nNet Realized and Net Change in Unrealized Gains or Losses\nThe Credit Facility matures on May 21, 2029 and generally bears an interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.55%. On May 11, 2020, the Company agreed to the increased interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.20% on the Credit Facility for the period between May 16, 2020 to November 15, 2020. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the SPV's properties and assets. Under the Loan Agreement, the SPV has made certain customary representations and warranties and is required to comply with various covenants, including reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The Loan Agreement includes usual and customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature.\nCredit Facility\nAny amount waived pursuant to the ELA is subject to repayment to our Adviser (an ELA Reimbursement\u201d) by us within the three years following the end of the quarter in which the waiver was made by our Adviser. If the ELA is terminated or expires pursuant to its terms, our Adviser maintains its right to repayment for any waiver it has made under the ELA, subject to the Repayment Limitations (discussed below).\nAny ELA Reimbursement can be made solely in the event that we have sufficient excess cash on hand at the time of any proposed ELA Reimbursement and shall be limited to the lesser of (i) the excess of the Annual Limit applicable to such quarter over the Company's actual Operating Expenses for such quarter and (ii) the amount of ELA Reimbursement which, when added to the Company's expenses for such quarter, permits the Company to pay the then-current aggregate quarterly distribution to its shareholders, at a minimum annualized rate of at least 6.00% (based on the gross offering prices of Company shares) (the Distribution\u201d) from the sum of (x) the Company's net investment income (loss) for such quarter plus (y) the Company's net realized gains (losses) for such quarter (collectively, the Repayment Limitations\u201d). For the purposes of the calculations pursuant to (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence, any ELA Reimbursement will be treated as an expense of the Company for such quarter, without regard to the GAAP treatment of such expense. In the event that the Company is unable to make a full payment of any ELA Reimbursements due for any applicable quarter because the Company does not have sufficient excess cash on hand, any such unpaid amount shall become a payable of the Company for accounting purposes and shall be paid when the Company has sufficient cash on hand (subject to the Repayment Limitations); provided, that in the case of any ELA Reimbursements, such payment shall be made no later than the date that is three years following the end of the quarter in which the applicable waiver was made by our Adviser.\nAs a BDC, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making our investments. For example, we have in the past and expect in the future to co-invest on a concurrent basis with certain affiliates, consistent with applicable regulations and our allocation procedures. On January 13, 2020, the parent company of the Adviser received an exemptive order from the SEC granting the ability to negotiate terms, other than price and quantity, of co-investment transactions with other funds managed by our Adviser or certain affiliates, including us, Prospect Capital Corporation and Priority Income Fund, Inc., subject to certain conditions included therein. Under the terms of the Order permitting us to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates, a majority of our independent directors who have no financial interest in the transaction must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies. The Order also imposes reporting and record keeping requirements and limitations on transactional fees. We may only co-invest with certain entities affiliated with our Adviser in negotiated transactions originated by our Adviser or its affiliates in accordance with such Order and existing regulatory guidance. See Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These co-investment transactions may give rise to conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest among us and the other participating accounts. To mitigate these conflicts, our Adviser and its affiliates will seek to allocate portfolio transactions for all of the participating investment accounts, including us, on a fair and equitable basis, taking into account such factors as the relative amounts of capital available for new investments, the applicable investment programs and portfolio positions, the clients for which participation is appropriate and any other factors deemed appropriate. We intend to make all of our investments in compliance with the 1940 Act and in a manner that will not jeopardize our status as a BDC or RIC.\nPer Share Information\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, purchases of investment securities (excluding short-term securities) were $12,454,720. During the same period, sales and redemptions of investment securities (excluding short-term securities) were $9,854,278. As of June 30, 2019, our investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $24,019,563, consisted of interests in 53 investment companies (76% in senior secured bonds, 2% in senior secured notes, 2% in equity/other and 20% in CLO - subordinated notes). In connection with the Merger, the Company expected to have its portfolio repositioned, including by selling portfolio investments that were not qualifying assets\u201d under the 1940 Act, for cash and re-investing such proceeds in assets that were qualifying assets\u201d under the 1940 Act and consistent with the Company's investment strategy. As of June 30, 2019, a substantial amount of such portfolio repositioning had been completed by the Company.\nMarket Risk\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K (the \"Annual Report\"). In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from any results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere herein.\nOur net investment income totaled $567,042, $268,928 and $518,793 for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively.\nInvestment Risks\nOn March 23, 2018, an amendment to Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act was signed into law to permit BDCs to reduce the minimum asset coverage\u201d ratio from 200% to 150%, so long as certain approval and disclosure requirements are satisfied. In addition, for BDCs like the Company whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, the Company is also required to offer to repurchase its outstanding shares at the rate of 25% per quarter over four calendar quarters. Under the existing 200% minimum asset coverage ratio, the Company is permitted to borrow up to one dollar for investment purposes for every one dollar of investor equity, and under the 150% minimum asset coverage ratio, the Company will be permitted to borrow up to two dollars for investment purposes for every one dollar of investor equity. In other words, Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, as amended, permits BDCs to potentially increase their debt-to-equity ratio from a maximum of 1 to 1 to a maximum of 2 to 1.\nThe Company has certain investments in its portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest provision, which represents contractual interest or dividends that are added to the principal balance and recorded as income. For the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, PIK interest included in interest income totaled $10,273 and $166, respectively. The Company stops accruing PIK interest when it is determined that PIK interest is no longer collectible. To maintain RIC tax treatment, and to avoid corporate tax, substantially all of this income must be paid out to the stockholders in the form of distributions, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash.\n\nInvestment Income\nGeneral\nExpense Limitation Agreement\n \u2022 direct costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone, and staff; \nWe believe that our current cash on hand and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations. This \"Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section should be read in conjunction with Wuhan Virus Pandemic under the \"Recent Developments\" section below.\nDuring the three months and twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we purchased investment securities (excluding short-term securities) of $1,675,000 and $23,678,340, respectively. During the same three month and twelve month period, sales and redemptions of investment securities (excluding short-term securities) were $2,286,635 and $8,271,306, respectively, resulting in a total net portfolio decline of ($611,634) for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and a total net portfolio growth of $15,407,034 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, our investment portfolio, with a total fair value of $36,663,703, consisted of interests in 54 investments (82% in senior secured loans, 2% in senior secured notes, 2% in equity/other and 14% in CLO - subordinated notes). During the three months and twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the investment activity continued to focus on repositioning the portfolio as a result of the Merger.\nOur investments are subject to a variety of risks. Those risks include the following:\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q, ASC 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies ( ASC 946\u201d), and Articles 3, 6 and 12 of Regulation S-X. Under the 1940 Act, ASC 946, and the regulations pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X, we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company or an operating company which provides substantially all of its services to benefit us. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Prospect Flexible Funding, LLC. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nIncentive Fee. The incentive fee consists of two parts: (1) the subordinated incentive fee on income and (2) the capital gains incentive fee.\nWe are offering for sale a maximum amount of $300,000,000 our shares of common stock on a \"best efforts\" basis. We are currently offering to sell our Class A Shares up to the maximum offering amount, at an offering price of $9.03 per Class A Share. As of August 27, 2020, we have sold a total of 2,367,478 shares of common stock, including 198,792 shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, for gross proceeds of approximately $31,652,992, including the reduction due to ($2,761,851) in shares repurchased pursuant to the Company's share repurchase program and 14,815 shares of common stock sold to Triton Pacific Adviser, LLC, our former investment adviser (the Former Adviser\u201d) in exchange for gross proceeds of $200,003. As a result of the Merger, the Company issued 775,193 shares.\n \u2022 independent directors' fees and expenses; \nAs part of our investment objective to generate current income, we expect that at least 70% of our investments will consist primarily of syndicated senior secured first lien loans, syndicated senior secured second lien loans, and to a lesser extent, subordinated debt. We expect that up to 30% of our investments will consist of other securities, including private equity (both common and preferred), dividend-paying equity, royalties, and the equity and junior debt tranches of collateralized loan obligations (\"CLOs\"), which we also refer to as subordinated structured notes (\"SSNs\"). The senior secured loans underlying our CLO investments are expected typically to be BB or B rated (non-investment grade, which are often referred to as high yield\u201d or junk\u201d) and in limited circumstances, unrated, senior secured loans.\nIf the Company does not distribute (or is not deemed to have distributed) at least 98% of its annual ordinary income and 98.2% of its net capital gains in the calendar year earned, it will generally be required to pay an excise tax equal to 4% of the amount by which 98% of its annual ordinary income and 98.2% of its capital gains exceeds the distributions from such taxable income for\nnet assets, equal to 8.00%. See Expense Limitation Agreement\u201d below.\nExpense Limitation Agreement\nfor tax purposes. Further, the components of net assets of the Company reflect the combined components of net assets of both PWAY and TPIC.\nThe Company follows ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. As of June 30, 2020, the Company did not record any unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities. Management's determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an on-going analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. Although the Company files both federal and state income tax returns, its major tax jurisdiction is federal. The Company's federal tax returns for the tax years ended December 31, 2017 and thereafter remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe amortization of offering costs for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively, were $575,073, $165,517 and $358,608. The increase in offering costs was driven by the increased marketing efforts as a result of the Merger.\nInterest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis. Accretion of such purchase discounts or amortization of such premiums is calculated using the effective interest method as of the settlement date and adjusted only for material amendments or prepayments. Upon the prepayment of a loan or bond, any unamortized discount or premium is recorded as interest income. The Company records dividend income on the ex-dividend date. The Company does not accrue as a receivable interest or dividends on loans and securities if it has reason to doubt its ability to collect such income. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Unpaid accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans are either applied to the cost basis or interest income, depending upon management's judgment of the collectibility of the loan receivable. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and in management's judgment, is likely to remain current and future principal and interest collections when due are probable. Interest received and applied against cost while a loan is on non-accrual, and PIK interest capitalized but not recognized while on non-accrual, is recognized prospectively on the effective yield basis through maturity of the loan when placed back on accrual status, to the extent deemed collectible by management. As of June 30, 2020, the Company did not have any loans on non-accrual status. Loan origination fees are capitalized and the Company accretes such amounts as interest income over the respective term of the loan or security. Upon the prepayment of a loan or security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. Upfront structuring fees are recorded as fee income when earned. The Company records prepayment premiums on loans and securities as fee income when it receives such amounts.\nFor financial reporting purposes, the Merger was treated as a recapitalization of PWAY followed by the reverse acquisition of TPIC by PWAY for a purchase price equivalent to the fair value of TPIC's net assets.\nOur primary operating expenses will be the payment of advisory fees and other expenses under the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser (the \"Investment Advisory Agreement\"). The advisory fees will compensate our Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The standard is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the optional guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. The Company did not utilize the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nWe have adopted an opt in\u201d distribution reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, when we make a distribution, stockholders will receive distributions in cash unless they specifically opt in\u201d to the distribution reinvestment plan so as to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to U.S. stockholders.\nIf the Company fails to satisfy the annual distribution requirement or otherwise fails to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, it would be subject to tax on all of its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates. The Company would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would it be required to make distributions. Distributions would generally be taxable to the Company's individual and other non-corporate taxable stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for the reduced maximum rate applicable to qualified dividend income to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits, provided certain holding period and other requirements are met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributions would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. To qualify again to be taxed as a RIC in a subsequent year, the Company would be required to distribute to its shareholders its accumulated earnings and profits attributable to non-RIC years. In addition, if the Company failed to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, then, in order to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year, it would be required to elect to recognize and pay tax on any net built-in gain (the excess of aggregate gain, including items of income, over aggregate loss that would have been realized if we had been liquidated) or, alternatively, be subject to taxation on such built-in gain recognized for a period of five years.\n\nResults of Operations\nDealer Manager Agreement\nEffective August 5, 2020, we amended our articles of incorporation to change our name to Prospect Flexible Income Fund, Inc. In addition, on August 5, 2020, we amended and restated our bylaws to reflect the change of our corporate name.\nFor the period beginning July 1, 2020 and ending August 27, 2020, the Company sold 17,295 shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of $156,000 and issued 15,959 shares pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan in the amount of $131,658.\n \u2022 federal, state and local taxes; \nAmounts due from the Adviser are for amounts waived under the ELA (as such term is defined in Note 4) and amounts due to the Adviser are for base management fees, incentive fees, operating expenses paid on our behalf and offering and organization expenses paid on our behalf. The due from and due to Adviser balances are presented net on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of June 30, 2020 and are presented gross on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of June 30, 2019. All balances due from and to the Adviser are settled quarterly.\nPursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay the Adviser a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee payable to the Adviser and any incentive fees it earns will ultimately be borne by our stockholders.\nIn accordance with the accounting and presentation for reverse acquisitions, the historical financial statements of the Company, prior to the date of the Merger reflect the financial positions and results of operations of PWAY, with the results of operations of TPIC being included commencing on April 1, 2019. Effective with the completion of the Merger, TPIC, changed its fiscal year end to be the last day of June consistent with PWAY's fiscal year.\nWe have engaged Triton Pacific Securities, LLC (the \"Dealer Manager\") to serve as the dealer manager for our offering. The dealer manager is not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of shares but will use its best efforts to sell the shares offered.\nThe Company has entered into an expense limitation agreement with the Adviser pursuant to which the Adviser, in its sole discretion,\nStructured Credit Related Risk\nExpenses\nSome of our loans and other investments may have contractual payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest or dividends. PIK income computed at the contractual rate is accrued into income and reflected as receivable up to the capitalization date. PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities. When additional securities are received, they typically have the same terms, including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued. On these payment dates, we capitalize the accrued interest (reflecting such amounts in the basis as additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. At the point that we believe PIK is not fully expected to be realized, the PIK investment will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are reversed from the related receivable through interest or dividend income, respectively. We do not reverse previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends. Upon capitalization, PIK is subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments. PIK investments on non-accrual status are restored to accrual status if we believe that PIK is expected to be realized.\nPortfolio Holdings\nWe will reimburse our Administrator for the administrative expenses necessary for its performance of services to us. Such costs will be reasonably allocated to us on the basis of assets, revenues, time records or other reasonable methods. However, such reimbursement is made in an amount equal to the lower of the Administrator's actual costs or the amount that we would be required to pay for comparable administrative services in the same geographic location. We will not reimburse our Administrator for any services for which it receives a separate fee or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of our Administrator.\nthe year. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income, it accrues excise taxes, if any, on estimated excess taxable income. As of June 30, 2020, the Company does not expect to have any excise tax due for the 2020 calendar year. Thus, the Company has not accrued any excise tax for this period.\nIf any of our contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs may increase under any new agreements that we enter into as replacements. We would also likely incur expenses in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. Any new investment advisory agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders.\nExpense Limitation Agreement with the Adviser\nIn connection with that determination, the Adviser provides the Company's board of directors with portfolio company valuations which are based on relevant inputs which may include indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by third-party valuation services.\n \u2022 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the preferred return but is less than or equal to 1.875% in any calendar quarter (7.5% annualized). We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the preferred return but is less than or equal to 1.875%) as the catch-up.\u201d The effect of the catch-up\u201d provision is that, if our pre-incentive fee net investment income reaches 1.875% in any calendar quarter, our Adviser will receive 20.0% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a preferred return did not apply. \n 1. Each portfolio company or investment is reviewed by investment professionals of the Adviser with the independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors. \nOur non-CLO investments are valued utilizing broker quotes, yield technique, enterprise value ( EV\u201d) technique, net asset value technique, liquidation technique, discounted cash flow technique, or a combination of techniques, as appropriate. The yield technique uses loan spreads for loans and other relevant information implied by market data involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Under the EV technique, the EV of a portfolio company is first determined and allocated over the portfolio company's securities in order of their preference relative to one another (i.e., waterfall\u201d allocation). To determine the EV, we\nOn March 31, 2019, Pathway Capital Opportunity Fund, Inc. ( PWAY\u201d) merged with and into us (the Merger\u201d). As the combined surviving company, we were renamed as TP Flexible Income Fund, Inc. (we were formerly known as Triton Pacific Investment Corporation, Inc. ( TPIC\u201d)). In connection with the Merger, Prospect Flexible Income Management, LLC (the \"Adviser\"), an affiliate of PWAY, became our investment adviser, and Prospect Administration LLC (the \"Administrator\" or \"Prospect Administration\"), an affiliate of the Adviser, became our administrator. Although PWAY merged with and into us, PWAY is considered the accounting survivor of the Merger and its historical financial statements are included and discussed herein and in other applicable reports that we file with the SEC.\n \u2022 all other expenses incurred by either our Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments to our Administrator under the Administration Agreement (as defined herein) that will be based upon our allocable portion of its overhead and other expenses incurred in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief executive officer, chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staffs.  Reimbursement of our Administrator for Administrative Services\nInvestments\n \u2022 brokerage commissions for our investments; \nItem 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nOn June 9, 2020, under our share repurchase program, we made an offer to purchase (the \"Tender Offer\") up to the number of shares of our issued and outstanding Class A common stock we can repurchase with the proceeds we receive from the issuance of shares under our distribution reinvestment plan prior to the expiration of the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer is for cash at a price equal to the net offering price per share determined as of July 10, 2020 ( Purchase Price\u201d). The offer expired at 4:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on July 8, 2020 and a total of 65,266 shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the offer. In accordance with the terms of the offer, the Company purchased 28,786 shares validly tendered and not withdrawn at a price equal to $8.25 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $237,488.\nMerger\nOperating Expenses\nLevel 3. Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nOn August 6, 2020, we amended our dealer manager agreement with our dealer manager to reflect a change to the upfront sales load paid to our dealer manager in connection with the sale of our Class A Shares. Under the amended dealer manager agreement, we will pay our dealer manager an upfront sales load of up to 9% of the gross proceeds received on Class A Shares sold in our offering all or a portion of which may be paid to selected broker-dealers and financial representatives. The upfront sales load consists of upfront selling commissions of up to 6.0% of the gross proceeds of Class A Shares sold in our offering and a dealer\nLevel 2.

We are an affiliate of Injured Workers Pharmacy, LLC (held through ACON IWP Investors I, L.L.C.). In general, under the 1940 Act, we would be presumed to control\u201d a portfolio company if we owned 25% or more of its voting securities and would be an affiliate\u201d of a portfolio company if we owned 5% or more of its voting securities.\nOffering Costs and Expenses\nOn April 8, 2020, in connection with the outbreak of the Wuhan Virus pandemic, the SEC issued an Order Under Sections 6(c), 17(d), 38(a) and 57(i) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 17d-1 Thereunder Granting Exemptions from Specified Provisions of the Investment Company Act and Certain Rules Thereunder, the 1940 Act Release No. 33837 (Apr. 8, 2020) (the April 2020 Order\u201d), which provides exemptions from certain requirements of the 1940 Act. Section II of the April 2020 Order (i) affords BDCs greater flexibility in calculating asset coverage ratios for purposes of the 1940 Act asset coverage requirements, (ii) requires a BDC's board of directors, including a required majority of such board, as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act, to determine that the issuance or sale of covered senior securities is permitted by this April 2020 Order and is in the best interests of the BDC and its stockholders, (iii) requires prior disclosure on Form 8-K of an election to rely on Section II of the April 2020 Order, and (iv) includes certain limitations on new investments, among other requirements detailed in the April 2020 Order. The Company has not taken advantage of the relief provided by the April 2020 Order.\nOverview\nCommon Shares\nThe interest and credit facility expense for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively, were $603,263, $58,638 and $67,195.\nTotal operating expenses before expense limitation support and waiver of offering costs totaled $3,484,040, $2,943,931 and $1,984,880 for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. These operating expenses consisted primarily of interest and credit facility expense, amortization of offering costs, base management fees, administrator costs, legal expense, audit and tax expense, and adviser shared service expense.\nWhile we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of the tax. In that event, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.\nDividends and Distributions\nImpact of the novel coronavirus (the \"Wuhan Virus\") pandemic\nSubordinated Incentive Fee on Income. The first part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the subordinated incentive fee on income, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based upon our pre-incentive fee net investment income\u201d for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For purposes of this fee, pre-incentive fee net investment income\u201d means interest income, dividend income and distribution cash flows from equity investments and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses reimbursed under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the organization and offering expenses and incentive fees on income and capital gains). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The subordinated incentive fee on income is subject to a quarterly fixed preferred return to investors, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, of 1.5% (6.0% annualized), subject to a catch up\u201d feature. Operating expenses are included in the calculation of the subordinated incentive fee on income.\n\nInterest rate risk represents a change in interest rates, which could result in an adverse change in the fair value of an interest-bearing financial instrument.\nInterest Rate Risk\n \u2022 costs of proxy statements, stockholders' reports and notices; \nOn March 31, 2019, we entered into the Administration Agreement with Prospect Administration, which was amended and restated effective as of June 17, 2019, pursuant to which Prospect Administration furnishes us with administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. The Administration Agreement with Prospect Administration initially became effective upon consummation of the Merger. We reimburse Prospect Administration for its allocable portion of overhead incurred by Prospect Administration in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and its allocable portion of the costs of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and her staff. We have engaged Bank of New York Mellon and affiliated entities to act as our custodian. We have also contracted with Phoenix American Financial Services to act as our transfer agent, plan administrator, distribution paying agent and registrar.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPurchase Price Allocation\nGains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated by using the specific identification method. The Company measures realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized.\nNet Realized Gains/Losses from Investments\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nOn September 2, 2014, PWAY entered into an administration agreement with Prospect Administration LLC, an affiliate of the Adviser and in which certain members of our senior management hold an equity interest and act as principals. Pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger as amended and restated, between TPIC and PWAY, Prospect Administration LLC became the administrator for the Company pursuant to an administrative agreement, as amended and restated as of June 17, 2019 (the \"Administration Agreement\"). The Administrator performs, oversees and arranges for the performance of administrative services necessary for the operation of the Company. These services include, but are not limited to, accounting, finance and legal services. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, the Company reimburses the Administrator for the Company's actual and allocable portion of expenses and overhead incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the Company's allocable portion of the costs of its Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and her staff. For the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 administrative costs incurred by the Company and PWAY to the Administrator were $596,030, $442,047 and $357,995, respectively. As of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, $122,384 and $341,235, respectively, was payable to the Administrator by the Company.\nDuring the three months and twelve months ended June 30, 2020, we drew an additional $0 and $15,500,000, respectively, on our Credit Facility (as defined herein) for a total of $21,000,000 outstanding on our credit facility as of June 30, 2020.

Opportunity Fund, Inc. (PWAY) and Triton Pacific Investment Corporation, Inc. (TPIC) was completed on March 31, 2019. PWAY is considered the accounting acquirer. \n\n- The company's investment portfolio had a fair value of $36.7 million as of June 30, 2020, consisting primarily of senior secured loans (78%), structured subordinated notes (14%), and other investments. \n\n- Net investment income was $567,042 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to $268,928 in the prior year, due to an increase in assets from the merger.\n\n- The company has a $50 million senior secured revolving credit facility to enhance investment opportunities. $21 million was outstanding on this facility as of June 30, 2020.\n\n- The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the fair value of investments due to market volatility. This resulted in higher net unrealized depreciation on investments in fiscal 2020.\n\n- Operating expenses were $3.5 million for fiscal 2020 compared to $2.9 million in fiscal 2019, primarily interest, credit facility expenses, amortization of offering costs, and management fees.\n\n- The company pays an investment advisory fee to its adviser Prospect Flexible Income Management consisting of a base management fee and an incentive fee.\n\n- The company has an expense limitation agreement with its adviser to limit operating expenses to a percentage of average net assets.\n\nIn summary, the merger with PWAY expanded assets, investment income increased but unrealized depreciation was higher due to COVID-19, and operating expenses also rose in fiscal 2020 compared to 2019. The company continues to reposition its investment portfolio and utilize leverage to enhance returns."}
