Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors,\u201d Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Business\u201d and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nRexford Industrial Realty, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed full-service REIT focused on owning and operating industrial properties in Southern California infill markets. We were formed as a Maryland corporation on January 18, 2013 and Rexford Industrial Realty, L.P. (the Operating Partnership\u201d), of which we are the sole general partner, was formed as a Maryland limited partnership on January 18, 2013. Through our controlling interest in our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, we own, manage, lease, acquire and develop industrial real estate primarily located in Southern California infill markets, and from time to time, acquire or provide mortgage debt secured by industrial property. We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under the Code, and generally are not subject to federal taxes on our income to the extent we distribute our income to our shareholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our consolidated portfolio consisted of 136 properties with approximately 15.0 million rentable square feet. In addition, we currently manage an additional 19 properties with approximately 1.2 million rentable square feet.\nOur goal is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders by providing superior access to industrial property investments and mortgage debt secured by industrial property in Southern California infill markets. Our target markets provide us with opportunities to acquire both stabilized properties generating favorable cash flow, as well as properties where we can enhance returns through value-add renovations and redevelopment. Scarcity of available space and high barriers limiting new construction of for-lease product all contribute to create superior long-term supply/demand fundamentals within our target infill Southern California industrial property markets. With our vertically integrated platform and extensive value-add investment and management capabilities, we believe we are in a position to capitalize upon the opportunities in our markets to achieve our objectives.\nHighlights\nAcquisitions\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During 2016, we acquired 20 properties, aggregating 3.4 million square feet, for an aggregate cost of $371.7 million, of which four properties aggregating 0.8 million square feet were considered value-add acquisitions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Repositioning\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During 2016, we leased-up four of our value-add repositioning properties located at 2610 & 2701 Birch Street, 24105 Frampton Avenue, 12247 Lakeland Road and 15140 & 15148 Bledsoe Street.

Available industrial supply continues to decrease in many of our target infill submarkets, landlord concessions are reducing and construction deliveries are falling short of demand. Meanwhile, underlying tenant demand within our infill markets continues to demonstrate growth, illustrated or driven by strong re-leasing spreads, an expanding regional population, substantial growth in e-commerce transaction and delivery volumes as well as further compression of delivery time-frames. Even with concerns about global growth, potential changes to trade and tariff policies and the threat of rising interest rates, we are seeing a number of positive trends in some of our key markets that we expect will continue into the upcoming year.\nIn Los Angeles County, we saw positive market trends in 2016, as record high occupancy levels continued year-over-year, and asking lease rates increased at a stable pace during 2016. We expect that rents will continue to improve through 2017, as occupancy is at near capacity levels and new development is limited by a lack of land availability and an increase in land and development costs.\nIn Orange County, rents continued their upward trend during 2016 and vacancy slightly declined year-over-year. We expect that the low availability of industrial product in this region, primarily due to re-zoning of available land to residential or mixed-use, will cause leasing rates to continue to grow through 2017.\nIn San Diego, the market fundamentals continued to be strong during 2016, as asking lease rates increased to a record high and overall vacancy in the market decreased to an all-time low.\nIn Ventura County, there was a slight increase in vacancy and a slight decrease in asking lease rates year-over-year.\nLastly, in the Inland Empire, new industrial product continues to be absorbed well in the market. In the Inland Empire West, which contains infill markets in which we operate, vacancy remained low and asking lease rates increased significantly year-over-year. We expect the outlook for the Inland Empire West to remain positive over the upcoming year. We generally do not focus on properties located within the non-infill Inland Empire East sub-market.\nAcquisitions and Development of Properties\nA key component of our growth strategy is to acquire properties through off-market and lightly marketed transactions that are often operating at below-market occupancy or below-market rent at the time of acquisition or that have near-term lease\nroll-over or that provide opportunities to add-value through functional or physical repositioning and improvements. Through various redevelopment, repositioning, and professional leasing and marketing strategies, we seek to increase the properties' functionality and attractiveness to prospective tenants and, over time, to stabilize the properties at occupancy and lease rates that meet or exceed market rates.\nA repositioning can consist of a range of improvements to a property. This may include a complete structural renovation of a property whereby we convert large underutilized spaces into a series of smaller and more functional spaces, or it may include the creation of additional square footage, the modernization of the property site, the elimination of functional obsolescence, the addition or enhancement of loading areas and truck access, the enhancement or fire-life-safety systems or other accretive improvements. Because each repositioning effort is unique and determined based on the property, targeted tenants and overall trends in the general market and specific submarket, the timing and effect of the repositioning on our rental revenue and occupancy levels will vary, and, as a result, will affect the comparison of our results of operations from period to period with limited predictability.\nAs of December 31, 2016, four of our properties were in various stages of repositioning and three of our properties were in the lease-up stage. In addition, we anticipate beginning repositioning work on five additional properties during 2017. The table below sets forth a summary of these properties, as well as the four repositioning properties that were completed and fully leased during 2016. In addition to the properties in the table below, we also have a range of smaller spaces in value-add repositioning or renovation, that due to their smaller size, are not presented below, however, in the aggregate, may be substantial.\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Construction Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property (Submarket)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Property Rentable Square Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Vacant Rentable Square Feet Under Repositioning/Lease-up Stage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Start\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Completion(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Occupancy at\n12/31/16\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current Repositioning:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2535 Midway Drive (Central SD)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SD\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>373,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>373,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10/22/2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4Q-2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3Q-2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>14750 Nelson Avenue (San Gabriel Valley)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9/8/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3Q-2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1Q-2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>301-445 Figueroa Street (South Bay)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11/4/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4Q-2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3Q-2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>228th Street (South Bay)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2/25/2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1Q-2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2Q-2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>744,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>594,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease-up Stage:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1601 Alton Parkway (OC Airport)(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>OC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6/27/2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4Q-2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1Q-2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>9401 De Soto Avenue (San Fernando Valley)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3/18/2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2Q-2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1Q-2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>679-691 S.

An increase in our repositioning and development activities resulting from value-add acquisitions could cause an increase in the asset balances qualifying for interest, insurance and tax capitalization in future periods. We capitalized $1.7 million of interest expense and $0.8 million of insurance and real estate tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2016, related to our repositioning and redevelopment projects.\nRental Revenue\nOur operating results depend primarily upon generating rental revenue from the properties in our consolidated portfolio. The amount of rental revenue generated by these properties is affected by our ability to maintain or increase occupancy levels and rental rates at our properties, which will depend upon our ability to lease vacant space and re-lease expiring space at favorable rates.\nOccupancy Rates\nAs of December 31, 2016, our consolidated portfolio was 91.7% occupied. We believe the opportunity to increase occupancy at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth. An opportunity to drive this growth will derive from the lease-up of recently completed repositioning projects and the completion and lease-up of repositioning projects that are currently under construction and planned for near-term construction.\nAs summarized in the table above, as of December 31, 2016, seven of our properties with a combined 0.8 million vacant rentable square feet, were currently in various stages of redevelopment, repositioning or lease-up. These seven properties are concentrated in our Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego markets, and represent 5.3% of our total consolidated portfolio square footage as of December 31, 2016. Including vacant repositioning space and lease-up space at these seven properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2016, in Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego was 92.1%, 96.1% and 81.0%, respectively. Excluding vacant repositioning space and lease-up space at these seven properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2016, in these markets was 97.9%, 96.7% and 97.3%, respectively, and our overall portfolio occupancy excluding these properties was 96.8%. We believe that a significant portion of our long-term future growth will come from the completion of these projects currently under or scheduled for repositioning, as well as through the identification or acquisition of new opportunities for redevelopment and repositioning, whether in our existing portfolio or through new investments, which may vary from period to period subject to market conditions.\nThe occupancy rate of properties not undergoing repositioning is affected by regional and local economic conditions in our Southern California infill markets. Throughout 2016, the Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego county markets have continued to show historically low vacancy and positive absorption, resulting from high tenant demand combined with low product availability. Accordingly, our properties in these markets have exhibited a similar trend. We expect general market conditions to remain positive in 2017, and we believe the opportunity to increase occupancy and rental rates at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth.\nLeasing Activity and Rental Rates\nThe following tables set forth our leasing activity for new and renewal leases on a quarterly basis for the year ended December 31, 2016:\nTable 189:

Comparable leases generally exclude: (i) space that has never been occupied under our ownership, (ii) recently repositioned/redeveloped space, (iii) space that has been vacant for over one year, (iv) space with different lease structures (for example a change from a gross lease to a modified gross lease or an increase or decrease in the leased square footage) or (v) space with lease terms shorter than six months.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(5)\n</td> <td>The GAAP and cash re-leasing rent spreads for renewal leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2016, exclude 36 leases aggregating 252,872 rentable square feet for which there was no comparable lease data due to either (i) space with different lease structures or (ii) space with lease terms shorter than six months.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur leasing activity is impacted both by our redevelopment and repositioning efforts, as well as by market conditions. While we reposition a property, its space may become unavailable for leasing until completion of our repositioning efforts. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we completed repositioning at five of our properties located at 9401 De Soto Avenue, 679-691 S. Anderson Street, 24105 Frampton Avenue, 12247 Lakeland Road and 15140 & 15148 Bledsoe Street, and at the end of 2015, we completed repositioning at our property located at 2610 & 2701 S. Birch Street. As of December 31, 2016, our properties located at 9401 De Soto Avenue and 679-691 S. Anderson Street were in the lease-up stage. We also have one\nrepositioning property located at 1601 Alton Parkway, with a construction completion period estimated for the first quarter of 2017, and four additional current repositioning properties with estimated construction completion periods ranging from mid-2017 to mid-2018. We expect these properties to have positive impacts on our leasing activity and revenue generation as we complete our value-add repositioning plans and place these properties in service.\nScheduled Lease Expirations\nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases is affected by economic and competitive conditions in our markets and by the desirability of our individual properties, which may impact our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, 1.2 million rentable square feet of our portfolio was available for lease and leases representing 0.7 million rentable square feet of our portfolio expired on December 31, 2016, including a full building lease for 207,953 rentable square feet held by one of our top tenants (Money Mailer Holding Corporation located at 12131 Western Avenue) and a second full building lease for 108,703 rentable square feet located at 3880 Valley Boulevard. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, we began our repositioning of these two buildings.\nLeases representing 16.3% and 12.6% of the aggregate rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we renewed 283 leases, or 58.6% of the number of leases scheduled to expire, which represented 64.2% of the aggregate rentable square footage under all expiring leases. Our retention rate during the year was impacted by our strategy to roll certain tenants at recessionary rents and to replace them with higher quality tenants paying higher rents. New and renewal leases signed during the current year had a weighted average term of 4.3 and 3.5 years, respectively, and we expect future new and renewal leases to have similar terms.\nThe leases scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2018, represent 17.8% and 14.5%, respectively, of the total annualized base rent for our portfolio as of December 31, 2016. We estimate that, on a weighted average basis, in-place rents of leases scheduled to expire in 2017 and 2018 are currently below current market asking rents, although individual units or properties within any particular submarket presently may be leased either above, below, or at the current market asking rates within that submarket. Over the last few years, rental rates for comparable product in our submarkets have generally been rising. This positive trend offers a favorable environment for additional increases in lease renewal rates. Accordingly, we expect 2017 will show positive renewal rates and leasing spreads. We also currently do not see any reason not to expect that 2018 lease expirations will show positive growth upon renewal; however, it is difficult to predict market conditions that far into the future.\nConditions in Our Markets\nThe properties in our portfolio are located primarily in Southern California infill markets. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in this market may affect our overall performance.\nProperty Expenses\nOur rental expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, site repair and maintenance costs, and the allocation of overhead costs. For the majority of our properties, our property expenses are recovered, in part, by either the triple net provisions or modified gross expense reimbursements in tenant leases. The majority of our leases also comprise contractual three percent annual rental rate increases meant, in part, to help mitigate potential increases in property expenses over time. However, the terms of our leases vary and in some instances we may absorb property expenses. Our overall financial results will be impacted by the extent to which we are able to pass-through property expenses to our tenants.\nTaxable REIT Subsidiary\nAs of December 31, 2016, our Operating Partnership indirectly and wholly owns Rexford Industrial Realty and Management, Inc., which we refer to as the services company. We have elected, together with our services company, to treat our services company as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary generally may provide non-customary and other services to our tenants and engage in activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a REIT, provided a taxable REIT subsidiary may not operate or manage a lodging facility or health care facility or provide rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated. We may form additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future, and our Operating Partnership may contribute some or all of its interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries or their assets to our services company. Any income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not be included in our taxable income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, except to the extent such income is distributed to us as a dividend, in which case such dividend income will qualify under the 95%, but not the 75%, gross income test. Because a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax, and state and local income tax (where applicable) as a\nregular corporation, the income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally will be subject to an additional level of tax as compared to the income earned by our other subsidiaries. Our taxable REIT subsidiary is a C-corporation subject to federal and state income tax, however it has a cumulative unrecognized net operation loss carryforward and therefore there is no income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We have summarized below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on financial condition and results of operations. Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions that it believes are reasonable as of the date hereof. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those of other companies.\nA critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity's financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management. Generally, the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by the users of our financial statements in their evaluation of our performance.\nThe following critical accounting policies discussion reflects what we believe are the most significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this report on Form 10-K.\nInvestment in Real Estate\nAcquisitions\nWhen we acquire operating properties with the intention to hold the investment for the long-term, and such acquisitions meet the accounting criteria to be accounted for as business combinations, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The components typically include land, building and improvements, tenant improvements, intangible assets related to above and below market leases, intangible assets related to in-place leases, debt and other assumed assets and liabilities. Because of the timing or complexity of completing certain fair value adjustments, the initial purchase price allocation may be incomplete at the end of a reporting period, in which case we may record provisional purchase price allocation amounts based on information available at the acquisition date. Subsequent adjustments to provisional amounts are recognized during the measurement period, which cannot exceed one year from the date of acquisition.\nWe allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of a property by valuing the property as if it were vacant. This as-if vacant\u201d value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow approach that relies upon Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs based on our assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use. These Level 3 inputs include discount rates, capitalization rates, market rents and comparable sales data for similar properties. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. In calculating the as-if-vacant\u201d value for acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2016, we used discount rates ranging from 6.00% and 8.50% and capitalization rates ranging from 5.25% to 7.50%.\nIn determining the fair value of intangible lease assets or liabilities, we also consider Level 3 inputs. Acquired above- and below-market leases are valued based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in-place rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases, if applicable. The estimated fair value of acquired in-place at-market tenant leases are the costs that would have been incurred to lease the property to the occupancy level of the property at the date of acquisition. Such estimates include the value associated with leasing commissions, legal and other costs, as well as the estimated period necessary to lease such property that would be incurred to lease the property to its occupancy level at the time of its acquisition. In determining the fair value for acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2016, we used an estimated average lease-up period ranging from six to twelve months. Acquisition costs associated with business combinations are expensed in the period they are incurred.\nThe difference between the fair value and the face value of debt assumed in connection with an acquisition is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized to interest expense\u201d over the life of the debt assumed. The valuation of assumed liabilities is based on our estimate of the current market rates for similar liabilities in effect at the acquisition date.\nFor acquisitions that do not meet the accounting criteria to be accounted for as a business combination, we allocate the cost of the acquisition, which includes any associated acquisition costs, to the individual assets (typically land and building) and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. We capitalized total acquisition costs of $0.2 million, $0.7 million and $0.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCapitalization of Costs\nWe capitalize direct costs incurred in developing, renovating, rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis. This includes certain general and administrative costs, including payroll, bonus, and non-cash equity compensation of the personnel performing development, renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are identifiable to a specific activity to get the real estate asset ready for its intended use. During the development and construction periods of a project, we also capitalize interest, real estate taxes and insurance costs. We cease capitalization of costs upon substantial completion of the project, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. If some portions of a project are substantially complete and ready for use and other portions have not yet reached that stage, we cease capitalizing costs on the completed portion of the project but continue to capitalize for the incomplete portion of the project. Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred.\nWe capitalized interest costs of $1.7 million, $0.8 million and $42 thousand during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We capitalized real estate taxes and insurance aggregating $0.8 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We capitalized compensation costs for employees who provide construction services of $1.0 million, $0.9 million and $0.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets Subsections of ASC Topic 360: Property, Plant, and Equipment, we assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets, including goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.\nRecoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. To review real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. The intent with regards to the underlying assets might change as market conditions and other factors change. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property, quoted market values and third party appraisals, where considered necessary. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan used to manage our underlying business. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we will recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property.\nAssumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with respect to our investment that occur subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our real estate properties.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from rent, tenant reimbursements and other revenue sources once all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, the delivery has occurred or services rendered, the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Minimum annual rental revenues are recognized in rental revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession or controls the physical use of the leased space.\nEstimated reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period that the recoverable expenses are incurred. Subsequent to year-end, we perform final reconciliations on a lease-by-lease basis and bill or credit each tenant for any cumulative annual adjustments. Lease\ntermination fees, which are included in rental revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, are recognized when the related lease is canceled and we have no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenant.\nRevenues from management, leasing and development services are recognized when the related services have been provided and earned.\nThe recognition of gains on sales of real estate requires us to measure the timing of a sale against various criteria related to the terms of the transaction, as well as any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the property. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, profit-sharing or leasing method. If the sales criteria have been met, we further analyze whether profit recognition is appropriate using the full accrual method. If the criteria to recognize profit using the full accrual method have not been met, we defer the gain and recognize it when the criteria are met or use the installment or cost recovery method as appropriate under the circumstances.\nValuation of Receivables\nWe are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables. In order to mitigate these risks, we perform credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed and on existing tenants before properties are acquired. We specifically analyze aged receivables, customer credit-worthiness, historical bad debts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. As a result of our periodic analysis, we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments. This estimate requires significant judgment related to the lessees' ability to fulfill their obligations under the leases. We believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate for our outstanding receivables for the periods presented. If a tenant is insolvent or files for bankruptcy protection and fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the net outstanding balances, which include amounts recognized as straight-line revenue not realizable until future periods.\nResults of Operations\nOur consolidated results of operations are often not comparable from period to period due to the effect of property acquisitions and dispositions completed during the comparative reporting periods. Our Total Portfolio\u201d represents all of the properties owned during the reported periods. To eliminate the effect of changes in our Total Portfolio due to acquisitions and dispositions and to highlight the operating results of our on-going business, we have separately presented the results of our Same Properties Portfolio.\u201d\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nFor the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our Same Properties Portfolio includes all properties in our industrial portfolio that were wholly-owned by us as of January 1, 2015, and still owned by us as of December 31, 2016, which consisted of 95 properties aggregating approximately 9.5 million rentable square feet. Results for our Same Properties Portfolio exclude our joint venture property, any properties that were acquired or sold during 2016 and 2015, interest income from our note receivable, interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses. For the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our Total Portfolio includes the properties in our Same Properties Portfolio, the 41 properties aggregating approximately 5.5 million rentable square feet that were acquired during 2015 and 2016, and the five properties aggregating approximately 0.3 million rentable square feet that were sold during 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our Same Properties Portfolio occupancy was approximately 96.1% and 93.0%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our Same Properties Portfolio weighted average occupancy was approximately 93.4% and 90.7%, respectively.\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td>

respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio is primarily due to the increase in our average occupancy for comparable periods and the increase in average rental rates on new and renewal leases. Our Total Portfolio rental revenue was also positively impacted by the revenues from the 41 properties we acquired during 2015 and 2016.\nTenant Reimbursements\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue increased $0.7 million, or 7.1%, and increased $6.2 million or 59.6%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio tenant reimbursements is primarily due to the lease-up of completed triple net repositioning properties during 2015 and supplemental assessments of certain of our properties resulting in lower reimbursable real estate taxes during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue was also impacted by the incremental reimbursements from the 41 properties we acquired during 2015 and 2016.\nOther Income\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio other income decreased by $0.3 million, or 32.6%, and $0.1 million, or 6.9%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in our Same Properties Portfolio other income is primarily due to a decrease in filming income at one of our properties and a decrease in late fee income and other miscellaneous tenant income. The decrease in our Total Portfolio income is primarily due to a decrease in miscellaneous tenant income.\nManagement, Leasing and Development Services\nOur Total Portfolio management, leasing and development services revenue decreased by $0.1 million, or 19.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to our acquisition of the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from our unconsolidated joint venture in July 2016. Prior to this acquisition, we earned fees and commissions for providing property and construction management services for the property.\nInterest Income\nOur Total Portfolio interest income decreased by $0.3 million, or 35.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016, relates to a $6.0 million mortgage loan that we made on July 1, 2016, that is secured by an industrial property located in Rancho Cucamonga, California and that bears interest at 10.0% per annum. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015, relates to a mortgage note receivable that was repaid on August 21, 2015, ahead of its scheduled maturity. The mortgage note receivable was secured by an industrial property located at 32401-32803 Calle Perfecto (the Calle Perfecto Note\u201d) and bore interest at 6.001% per annum.\nProperty Expenses\nOur Same Properties Portfolio property expenses increased by $1.2 million or 5.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in real estate tax expense and repairs and maintenance. The increase in real estate tax expense was due to supplemental assessments of certain of our properties resulting in lower real estate taxes during the year ended December 31, 2015, and a decrease in capitalized real estate taxes for properties under repositioning for comparable periods. Our Total Portfolio property expenses increased by $8.6 million, or 34.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the incremental expenses from the 41 properties we acquired during 2015 and 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur Total Portfolio general and administrative expenses increased by $2.4 million, or 16.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to the following: (i) a $2.0 million increase in non-cash equity compensation expense primarily due to equity grants made in December 2015, (ii) a $0.9 million increase in bonus expense due to Company performance, (iii) a $0.7 million increase in payroll and employment related costs primarily due to an increase in headcount, (iv) a $0.4 million increase in other various corporate expenses and (v) a $0.4 million increase in professional service and consulting fees. These increases were partially offset by the following: (i) a $1.6 million decrease in legal fees, which includes a $1.0 million insurance reimbursement of legal fees related to prior litigation received during the year ended December 31, 2016, and (ii) a $0.5 million decrease in professional audit, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance and tax fees.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nOur Same Properties Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $3.0 million, or 8.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to acquired lease related intangible and tangible assets for several of our properties becoming fully depreciated during 2016 and 2015, partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense related to capital improvements. Our Total Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense increased $9.6 million, or 22.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to incremental expense from the 41 properties we acquired during 2015 and 2016, and an increase in depreciation expense related to capital improvements, partially offset by the decrease in our Same Properties Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense noted above.\nAcquisition Expenses\nOur Total Portfolio acquisition expenses decreased by $0.3 million, or 13.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to lower brokerage fees related to acquisitions completed during the current year.\nInterest Expense\nOur Total Portfolio interest expense increased by $6.4 million, or 75.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to the following: (i) an increase in interest expense from the $225 million term loan facility which was fully drawn upon in April 2016, (ii) the issuance of $100 million of 4.29% fixed rate senior notes in August 2015 and subsequent repayment of two secured loans aggregating $91.3 million with a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.76% and (iii) the effect of four interest rate swaps, with an aggregate notional value of $160 million, that became effective between January 2015 and February 2016. These increases were partially offset by the following: (i) higher capitalized interest resulting from an increase in construction activity related to our repositioning properties and (ii) a decrease in interest expense from the reduced usage of our unsecured revolving credit facility during 2016.\nEquity in Income from Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities\nOn July 6, 2016, we acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from our unconsolidated joint venture (the JV\u201d). Prior to the acquisition, our ownership interest in the property was 15.0%. Equity in income from unconsolidated real estate entities includes our 15.0% equity interest in the operating results of the JV property prior to July 6, 2016, depreciation of basis adjustments related to the JV property and distributions received from the JV in connection with the sale of the property that exceeded the carrying value of our investment in the JV (the excess distributions\u201d). Our Total Portfolio equity in income from unconsolidated real estate entities increased by $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the excess distributions totaling $1.9 million that we received from the JV, partially offset by the write-off of the $0.6 million unamortized basis adjustment related to the JV property. For additional information, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K.\nGain from Early Repayment of Note Receivable\nThe gain from early repayment of note receivable of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, represents the recognition of the unamortized accretable yield related to the collection of the Calle Perfecto Note.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we repaid the $48.5 million term loan secured by eight of our properties and the mortgage loan encumbering the property located at 2980-2990 San Fernando Road. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million represents the write-off of $0.3 million of unamortized deferred loan costs related to the term loan, partially offset by the write-off of the $0.1 million unamortized loan premium related to the mortgage loan. We repaid both loans in advance of the maturity date without incurring prepayment fees.\nGain on Sale of Real Estate\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a total gain of $17.4 million from the disposition of five properties that were sold for an aggregate gross sales price of $40.7 million.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nFor the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our Same Properties Portfolio includes all properties in our industrial portfolio that were wholly-owned by us as of January 1, 2014, and still owned by us as of December 31, 2015, which consisted of 62 properties aggregating approximately 6.1 million rentable square feet. Results for our Same Properties Portfolio exclude our JV properties, any properties that were acquired or sold during 2015 or 2014, interest income from our note receivable, and corporate general and administrative expenses. For the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our Total Portfolio includes the properties in our Same Properties Portfolio, the 57 properties aggregating approximately 5.9 million rentable square feet that were acquired during 2015 and 2014, and the three properties aggregating approximately 0.2 million rentable square feet that were sold during 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our Same Properties Portfolio occupancy was approximately 94.4% and 92.8%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our Same Properties Portfolio weighted average occupancy was approximately 93.2% and 91.0%, respectively.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td>

Revenue\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio rental revenue increased by $2.1 million, or 4.6%, and $24.5 million, or 43.2%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio is primarily due to the increase in our average occupancy for comparable periods and the increase in average rental rates on new and renewal leases. Our Total Portfolio rental revenue was also positively impacted by the revenues from the 57 properties we acquired during 2014 and 2015.\nTenant Reimbursements\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue decreased $0.1 million, or 2.1%, and increased $2.8 million or 36.8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in our Same Properties Portfolio tenant reimbursements is directly related to the decrease in real estate taxes resulting from supplemental assessments of certain of our properties, as described below under property expenses, as well as lower reimbursements resulting from the completion of prior year recoverable expense reconciliations for comparable periods. Our Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements primarily increased due to the incremental reimbursements from the 57 properties we acquired during 2014 and 2015.\nOther Income\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio other income increased by $0.3 million, or 112.8%, and $0.7 million, or 230.0%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in late fee income.\nManagement, Leasing and Development Services\nOur Total Portfolio management, leasing and development services revenue decreased by $0.3 million, or 32.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily due to lower management fees from the JV as a result of the sale of two of the three buildings owned by the JV in November 2014.\nInterest Income\nOur Total Portfolio interest income decreased by $0.4 million, or 36.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. On August 21, 2015, the borrower of the Calle Perfecto Note repaid the outstanding principal balance ahead of its schedule maturity. The decrease in interest income is a result of this early repayment.\nProperty Expenses\nOur Same Properties Portfolio property expenses decreased by $0.2 million or 1.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, and as a percentage of total rental revenues decreased to 27.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 28.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a decrease in recoverable expenses including utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, and real estate tax expense resulting from supplemental assessments of certain of our properties, partially offset by an increase in non-recoverable overhead costs. Our Total Portfolio property expenses increased by $6.6 million, or 36.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the incremental expenses from the 57 properties we acquired during 2014 and 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur Total Portfolio general and administrative expenses increased by $2.9 million, or 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due to the following: (i) a $0.8 million increase in employee-related costs due to increased staffing levels from growth, (ii) a $0.8 million increase in non-cash equity compensation expense primarily due to restricted stock grants made during 2014 and 2015, (iii) a $0.7 million increase in professional audit, SOX compliance and tax fees, and (iv) a $0.9 million increase in various overhead costs, including rent and other professional services fees. This increase was partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in legal fee expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nOur Same Properties Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2.8 million, or 13.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to acquired lease related intangible and tangible assets for several of our properties becoming fully depreciated during 2015 and 2014. Our Total Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense increased $13.2 million, or 46.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the 57 properties we acquired during 2014 and 2015.\nAcquisition Expenses\nOur Total Portfolio acquisition expenses increased by $0.1 million, or 4.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased brokerage fees related to acquisitions completed during the current year.\nInterest Expense\nOur Same Properties Portfolio interest expense decreased by $0.5 million, or 48.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the repayment of the outstanding mortgages encumbering the Glendale Commerce Center during August 2015 and the property located at 10700 Jersey Boulevard during October 2014. Our Total Portfolio interest expense increased by $2.1 million, or 32.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily due to the increase in our weighted average interest rate resulting from the issuance of $100 million of 4.29% fixed rate senior notes in August 2015 and the three interest rate swaps that were in effect during the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as the increase in our average outstanding debt balances. The increase was partially offset by the mortgage repayments noted above and an increase in capitalized interest due to increased construction activity on our repositioning properties during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nEquity in Income (Loss) from Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities\nEquity in income (loss) from unconsolidated real estate entities includes our equity interests in the operating results of the properties held by our JV and basis adjustments related to these properties. In November 2014, the JV sold two of the three properties owned by the JV. Our Total Portfolio equity in income (loss) from unconsolidated real estate entities increased by $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the change in basis adjustments following the sale of these properties.\nGain from Early Repayment of Note Receivable\nThe gain from early repayment of note receivable of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, represents the recognition of the unamortized accretable yield related to the collection of the Calle Perfecto Note.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we repaid the $48.5 million term loan secured by eight of our properties and the mortgage loan encumbering the property located at 2980-2990 San Fernando Road. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million represents the write-off of $0.3 million of unamortized deferred loan costs related to the term loan, partially offset by the write-off of the $0.1 million unamortized loan premium related to the mortgage loan. We repaid both loans in advance of the maturity date without incurring prepayment fees.\nLoss on Sale of Real Estate\nThe loss on sale of real estate of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, relates to the disposition of our property located at 500-560 Zenith Drive, in Glenview, Illinois ( Zenith Drive\u201d). We adopted ASU 2014-08: Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity ( ASU 2014-08\u201d), beginning with the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2014. Under ASU 2014-08, only disposals that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the entity's results and operations would qualify as discontinued operations. The disposal of Zenith Drive did not meet the criteria to be classified in discontinued operations, and as such, the loss on sale of real estate is included in continuing operations.\nIncome From Discontinued Operations\nIncome from discontinued operations of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, is comprised primarily of the gain on sale of our property located at 1335 Park Center Drive, partially offset by the loss on sale of our property located at 2900 N. Madera Road.\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Measure: Funds From Operations\nWe calculate funds from operations ( FFO\u201d) attributable to common stockholders in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures.\nManagement uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, and asset impairments, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of performance used by other REITs, FFO may be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs.\nHowever, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate or interpret FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to FFO (in thousands):\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>976\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization, including amounts in discontinued operations\n</td> <td>51,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures (1)\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>357\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on sale of real estate\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deduct:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of real estate, including amounts in discontinued operations\n</td> <td>(17,377\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,125\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of real estate from unconsolidated joint venture (2)\n</td> <td>(1,332\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds from operations (FFO)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: preferred stock dividends\n</td> <td>(1,983\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: FFO attributable to noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>(1,751\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,644\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,329\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: FFO attributable to participating securities\n</td> <td>(473\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(322\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(102\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Amount represents our 15% share of unconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization.

NOI is calculated as total rental revenues from real estate operations including i) rental income, ii) tenant reimbursements, and iii) other income less property expenses (before interest expense, depreciation and amortization). We use NOI as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, gains (or losses) on sale of real estate and other non-operating items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that NOI will be useful to investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because NOI excludes depreciation and amortization expense and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties (all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations), the utility of NOI as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate NOI in a similar manner and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to such other REITs' NOI. Accordingly, NOI should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.\nNOI on a cash-basis (Cash NOI) is a non-GAAP measure, which we calculate by adding or subtracting from NOI (i) fair value lease revenue and (ii) straight-line rent adjustments. We use Cash NOI, together with NOI, as a supplemental performance measure. Cash NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. Cash NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table sets forth the revenue and expense items comprising NOI and the adjustments to calculate Cash NOI (in thousands):\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of our operating performance as a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of our industrial properties. We also use this measure in ratios to compare our performance to that of our industry peers. However, our industry peers may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner as we do and, accordingly, our EBITDA may not be comparable to our peers' EBITDA. Accordingly, EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to EBITDA (in thousands):\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>976\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>14,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proportionate share of interest expense from unconsolidated joint venture\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization, including amounts in discontinued operations\n</td> <td>51,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proportionate share of real estate related depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint venture (1)\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>357\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Amount represents our 15% share of unconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization.

We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through available cash on hand, cash flow from operations, by drawing on our unsecured revolving credit facility and by issuing shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Program described below.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through net cash flow from operations, proceeds from long-term secured and unsecured financings, borrowings available under our unsecured revolving credit facility, the issuance of equity securities, including preferred stock, and proceeds from selective real estate dispositions as we identify capital recycling opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $15.5 million, and we did not have any amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility, leaving $200.0 million available for additional borrowings.\nSources of Liquidity\nCash Flow from Operations\nCash flow from operations is one of our key sources of liquidity and is primarily dependent upon: (i) the occupancy levels and lease rates at our properties, (ii) our ability to collect rent, (iii) the level of operating costs we incur and (iv) our ability to pass through operating expenses to our tenants. We are subject to a number of risks related to general economic and other unpredictable conditions, which have the potential to affect our overall performance and resulting cash flows from operations. However, based on our current portfolio mix and business strategy, we anticipate that we will be able to generate positive cash flows from operations.\nATM Program\nOn April 17, 2015, we established the ATM Program pursuant to which we may issue and sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $125.0 million of our common stock through sales agents. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have sold 571,868 shares of common stock under the ATM Program for aggregate gross proceeds of $13.2 million, leaving us with the capacity to issue up to $111.8 million of additional shares. Future sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, determinations by us of the appropriate sources of funding for us and potential uses of funding available to us. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of shares under the ATM Program, if any, to fund potential acquisition opportunities, repay amounts outstanding from time to time under our unsecured revolving credit facility or other debt financing obligations, to fund our development or redevelopment activities and/or for general corporate purposes.\nEquity Offerings\nOn April 15, 2016, we completed a public follow-on offering (the Equity Offering\u201d) of 10,350,000 shares of our common stock, including the underwriters exercise in full of its option to purchase an additional 1,350,000 shares of our common stock, at an offering price of $17.65 per share. The net proceeds were approximately $174.4 million, after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering costs totaling $8.3 million. A portion of the net proceeds from the Equity Offering were used to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, which had an outstanding balance of $62.5 million on April 15, 2016, the date of repayment, and to partially fund the REIT Portfolio Acquisition as discussed below under -Uses of Liquidity- REIT Portfolio Acquisition.\nOn August 16, 2016, we completed a public offering of 3,600,000 shares of our 5.875% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the Series A Preferred Stock\u201d) at a price of $25.00 per share. The net proceeds from the preferred offering were approximately $86.7 million, after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering costs totaling $3.3 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering to fund various acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.\nWe evaluate the capital markets on an ongoing basis for opportunities to raise capital, and as circumstances warrant, we may issue additional securities, from time to time, to fund acquisitions or repositioning costs, for the repayment of long-term debt\nupon maturity and for other general corporate purposes. Any future issuance, however, is dependent upon market conditions, available pricing and capital needs and there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such offerings of securities.\nCapital Recycling\nWe continuously evaluate opportunities for the potential disposition of properties in our portfolio when we believe such disposition is appropriate in view of our business objectives. In evaluating these opportunities, we consider a variety of criteria including, but not limited to, local market conditions and lease rates, asset type and location, as well as potential uses of proceeds and tax considerations. Tax considerations include entering into tax-deferred like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code ( 1031 Exchange\u201d), when possible, to defer some or all of the taxable gains, if any, on dispositions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we completed the sale of five of our properties for an aggregate gross sales price of $40.7 million. The net cash proceeds from these dispositions, which totaled $38.5 million, were used to acquire three properties in three separate 1031 Exchange transactions.\nWe anticipate continuing to selectively dispose of properties, however, the timing of any potential future dispositions will depend on market conditions and our capital needs. Our ability to dispose of selective properties on advantageous terms, or at all, is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable.\nUnsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility\nOn February 14, 2017, we amended our $300 million unsecured credit facility (the Prior Credit Facility\u201d) by entering into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides for a $450 million senior unsecured credit facility, comprised of a $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Amended Revolver\u201d) and a $100 million unsecured term loan facility (the \"Amended Term Loan\"). The Amended Revolver is scheduled to mature on February 12, 2021, and has two six-month extension options available for a maximum maturity date of February 14, 2022, subject to certain conditions and the payment of an additional fee. The Amended Term Loan is scheduled to mature on February 14, 2022. Under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, we may request additional lender commitments up to an additional aggregate $550 million, which may be comprised of additional revolving commitments under the Amended Revolver, an increase to the Amended Term Loan, additional term loan tranches or any combination of the foregoing.\nInterest on the Amended Credit Agreement, is generally to be paid based upon, at our option, either (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin that is based upon our leverage ratio or (ii) the Base Rate (which is defined as the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the administrative agent's prime rate or (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin that is based on our leverage ratio. The margins for the Amended Revolver range in amount from 1.10% to 1.50% for LIBOR-based loans and 0.10% to 0.50% for Base Rate-based loans, depending on our leverage ratio. The margins for the Amended Term Loan range in amount from 1.20% to 1.70% for LIBOR-based loans and 0.20% to 0.70% for Base Rate-based loans, depending on our leverage ratio.\nIf we attain one additional investment grade rating by one or more of Standard & Poor's or Moody's Investor Services to complement our current investment grade Fitch rating, we may elect to convert the pricing structure under the Amended Credit Agreement to be based on such rating. In that event, the margins for the Amended Revolver will range in amount from 0.825% to 1.550% for LIBOR-based loans and 0.00% to 0.55% for Base Rate-based loans, depending on such rating. The margins for the Amended Term Loan will range in amount from 0.90% to 1.75% for LIBOR-based loans and 0.00% to 0.75% for Base Rate-based loans, depending on such ratings.\nIn addition to the interest payable on amounts outstanding under the Amended Revolver, we are required to pay an applicable facility fee, based upon our leverage ratio, on the aggregate amount of each lender's Revolving Credit Commitment (whether or not such Revolving Credit Commitment is drawn), as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement. The applicable facility fee will range in amount from 0.15% to 0.30%, depending on our leverage ratio. In the event that we convert the pricing structure to be based on an investment-grade rating, the applicable facility fee will range in amount from 0.125% to 0.30%, depending on such rating.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement is guaranteed by the Company and by substantially all of the current and to-be-formed subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership that own an unencumbered property. The Amended Credit Agreement is not secured by the Company's properties or by equity interests in the subsidiaries that hold such properties.\nThe Amended Revolver and the Amended Term Loan may be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part at any time without\npremium or penalty. Amounts borrowed under the Amended Term Loan and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement contains usual and customary events of default including defaults in the payment of principal, interest or fees, defaults in compliance with the covenants set forth in the Amended Credit Facility and other loan documentation, cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness, and bankruptcy and other insolvency defaults. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Amended Credit Facility, the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans, together with all accrued unpaid interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, may be declared immediately due and payable.\nAs of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we had borrowings of $115 million outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement, including $15 million drawn on the Amended Revolver and $100 million under the Amended Term Loan.\n$225 Million Term Loan Facility\nOn January 14, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement for a senior unsecured term loan facility (the $225 Million Term Loan Facility\u201d) that initially permits aggregate borrowings of up to $125 million, the total of which we borrowed the same day at closing. Under the terms of the $225 Million Term Loan Facility, we are permitted to add one or more incremental term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $100 million (the Accordion\u201d), subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions. On April 15, 2016, we exercised the Accordion in full, thereby increasing the aggregate amount outstanding under the $225 Million Term Loan Facility to $225 million. The maturity date of the $225 Million Term Loan Facility is January 14, 2023.\nInterest on the $225 Million Term Loan Facility accrues based upon, at our option, either (i) LIBOR plus the applicable Eurodollar rate margin or (ii) the applicable base rate which is the greater of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the administrative agent's prime rate or (c) the thirty-day LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus the applicable base rate margin. Until we obtain an investment grade rating by two or more of Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch Ratings, and elect to use the alternative rates based on our debt rating, the applicable Eurodollar rate margin will range from 1.50% to 2.25% per annum, and the applicable base rate margin will range from 0.50% to 1.25% per annum, depending on our Leverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement).\nWe have the option to voluntarily prepay any amounts borrowed under the $225 Million Term Loan Facility in whole or in part at any time, subject to certain notice requirements. To the extent that we prepay all or any portion of a loan on or prior to January 14, 2018, we will pay a prepayment premium equal to (i) if such prepayment occurs prior to January 14, 2017, 2.00% of the principal amount so prepaid and (ii) if such prepayment occurs on or after January 14, 2017, but prior to January 14, 2018, 1.00% of the principal amount so prepaid. Amounts borrowed under the $225 Million Term Loan Facility and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.\nInvestment Grade Rating\nDuring 2015, we obtained investment grade ratings of BBB- from Fitch Ratings on our Prior Credit Facility and $100 million guaranteed senior notes (the Notes\u201d). In April 2016, we also obtained the same rating on our $225 Million Term Loan Facility. These were most recently affirmed in August 2016, with a stable outlook. In August 2016, we also obtained an investment grade rating of BB from Fitch Ratings on the Series A Preferred Stock. Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. In the event our current credit ratings are downgraded, it may become difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing indebtedness as maturities become due.\nUses of Liquidity\nAcquisitions\nOne of our most significant liquidity needs has historically been for the acquisition of real estate properties. As part of our growth strategy, we are actively monitoring a volume of properties in our markets that we believe represent attractive potential investment opportunities. While the actual number of acquisitions that we complete will be dependent upon a number of factors, in the short term, we expect to fund our acquisitions through available cash on hand, cash flows from operations, borrowings available under the Amended Revolver, recycling capital through property dispositions and, in the long term, through the issuance of equity securities or proceeds from long-term secured and unsecured financings. On February 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of a single-tenant industrial property for a contract price of $17.1 million. The acquisition was funded using available cash on hand and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nREIT Portfolio Acquisition\nOn April 11, 2016, we entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d) to acquire a private real estate investment trust that owns a portfolio of nine industrial properties totaling approximately 1.53 million rentable square feet, from a third-party seller in exchange for approximately $191.0 million in cash, exclusive of closing costs (the REIT Portfolio Acquisition\u201d).\nOn April 15, 2016, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, we consummated the transaction. We funded the purchase price and related transaction costs with available cash and the proceeds from the Accordion and the Equity Offering.\nRecurring and Nonrecurring Capital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures are considered part of both our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $2.8 million of recurring capital expenditures, which was a decrease of $0.7 million over the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $21.2 million of non-recurring capital expenditures, which was an increase of $6.7 million over the prior year. The increase in non-recurring capital expenditures is primarily due to an increase in our redevelopment and repositioning activity and the growth of our overall portfolio. As discussed above under -Factors that May Influence Future Results -Acquisitions and Development of Properties, as of December 31, 2016, seven of our properties were in various stages of redevelopment and repositioning or lease-up, and we anticipate beginning repositioning work on five additional properties during 2017. We currently estimate that approximately $83.3 million of capital will be required over the next seven quarters (1Q-2017 through 3Q-2018) to complete the redevelopment and repositioning of these 12 properties. However, this estimate is based on our current construction plan and budgets, both of which are subject to change as a result of a number of factors. If we are unable to complete construction on schedule or within budget, we could incur increased construction costs and experience potential delays in leasing the properties. We expect to fund these projects through a combination of cash flow from operations, borrowings available under the Revolver, and recycling capital through property dispositions.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our principal obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016, including (i) scheduled principal payments and debt maturities, (ii) periodic interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness and interest rate swaps, (iii) office and ground lease payments and (iv) other contractual obligations (in thousands):\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments and debt maturities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>502,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>327,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - fixed rate debt\n</td> <td>41,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - variable rate debt(1)\n</td> <td>43,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate swap payments(2)\n</td> <td>8,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office lease payments\n</td> <td>1,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ground lease payments\n</td> <td>6,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations(3)\n</td> <td>10,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>614,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>356,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Based on the 1-month LIBOR rate of 0.7717%, as of December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Reflects the estimated payments to counterparties assuming that the 1-month LIBOR rate is equal to 0.7717% from the effective date through the maturity date of each respective interest rate swap.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Includes total commitments for tenant improvement and construction work related to obligations under certain tenant leases and vendor contracts.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $15.9 million to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to incremental cash flows from property acquisitions completed after January 1, 2015, and the increase in Cash NOI from our Same Properties Portfolio, partially offset by higher cash interest paid for comparable periods.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $124.4 million to $361.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $236.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to the $139.1 million increase in cash paid for property acquisitions and the $9.7 million increase in cash paid for construction and repositioning projects for comparable periods, partially offset by aggregate net proceeds of $38.5 million received from five real estate dispositions completed during 2016.\nNet cash provided by financing activities.

This may include a complete structural renovation of a property whereby we convert large underutilized spaces into a series of smaller and more functional spaces, or it may include the creation of additional square footage, the modernization of the property site, the elimination of functional obsolescence, the addition or enhancement of loading areas and truck access, the enhancement or fire-life-safety systems or other accretive improvements. Because each repositioning effort is unique and determined based on the property, targeted tenants and overall trends in the general market and specific submarket, the timing and effect of the repositioning on our rental revenue and occupancy levels will vary, and, as a result, will affect the comparison of our results of operations from period to period with limited predictability.\nThe recognition of gains on sales of real estate requires us to measure the timing of a sale against various criteria related to the terms of the transaction, as well as any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the property. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, profit-sharing or leasing method. If the sales criteria have been met, we further analyze whether profit recognition is appropriate using the full accrual method. If the criteria to recognize profit using the full accrual method have not been met, we defer the gain and recognize it when the criteria are met or use the installment or cost recovery method as appropriate under the circumstances.\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio rental revenue increased by $5.6 million, or 7.9%, and $26.5 million, or 32.6%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio is primarily due to the increase in our average occupancy for comparable periods and the increase in average rental rates on new and renewal leases. Our Total Portfolio rental revenue was also positively impacted by the revenues from the 41 properties we acquired during 2015 and 2016.\nManagement, Leasing and Development Services\nAs of December 31, 2016, 1.2 million rentable square feet of our portfolio was available for lease and leases representing 0.7 million rentable square feet of our portfolio expired on December 31, 2016, including a full building lease for 207,953 rentable square feet held by one of our top tenants (Money Mailer Holding Corporation located at 12131 Western Avenue) and a second full building lease for 108,703 rentable square feet located at 3880 Valley Boulevard.

NOI is calculated as total rental revenues from real estate operations including i) rental income, ii) tenant reimbursements, and iii) other income less property expenses (before interest expense, depreciation and amortization). We use NOI as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, gains (or losses) on sale of real estate and other non-operating items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that NOI will be useful to investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because NOI excludes depreciation and amortization expense and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties (all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations), the utility of NOI as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate NOI in a similar manner and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to such other REITs' NOI. Accordingly, NOI should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.\n (2) The total property rentable square feet in the table above reflects the square footage of the existing building that was acquired.

Receivable\nInterest Expense\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to NOI and Cash NOI (in thousands): \n \u2022 Maintaining a ratio of unencumbered NOI (as defined in the credit agreement) to unsecured interest expense of at least 1.75 to 1.0.  Additionally, the $225 Million Term Loan Facility and the Amended Credit Agreement contain limitations on our ability to pay distributions on our common stock. Specifically, our cash dividends may not exceed the greater of (1) 95% of our FFO (as\ndefined in the credit agreement) and (2) the amount required for us to qualify and maintain our REIT status. If an event of default exists, we may only make distributions sufficient to qualify and maintain our REIT status.\nAs of December 31, 2016, four of our properties were in various stages of repositioning and three of our properties were in the lease-up stage. In addition, we anticipate beginning repositioning work on five additional properties during 2017. The table below sets forth a summary of these properties, as well as the four repositioning properties that were completed and fully leased during 2016. In addition to the properties in the table below, we also have a range of smaller spaces in value-add repositioning or renovation, that due to their smaller size, are not presented below, however, in the aggregate, may be substantial.\nManagement uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, and asset impairments, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of performance used by other REITs, FFO may be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs.\nFor the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our Same Properties Portfolio includes all properties in our industrial portfolio that were wholly-owned by us as of January 1, 2015, and still owned by us as of December 31, 2016, which consisted of 95 properties aggregating approximately 9.5 million rentable square feet. Results for our Same Properties Portfolio exclude our joint venture property, any properties that were acquired or sold during 2016 and 2015, interest income from our note receivable, interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses. For the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our Total Portfolio includes the properties in our Same Properties Portfolio, the 41 properties aggregating approximately 5.5 million rentable square feet that were acquired during 2015 and 2016, and the five properties aggregating approximately 0.3 million rentable square feet that were sold during 2016.\nInterest on the Amended Credit Agreement, is generally to be paid based upon, at our option, either (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin that is based upon our leverage ratio or (ii) the Base Rate (which is defined as the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the administrative agent's prime rate or (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin that is based on our leverage ratio. The margins for the Amended Revolver range in amount from 1.10% to 1.50% for LIBOR-based loans and 0.10% to 0.50% for Base Rate-based loans, depending on our leverage ratio. The margins for the Amended Term Loan range in amount from 1.20% to 1.70% for LIBOR-based loans and 0.20% to 0.70% for Base Rate-based loans, depending on our leverage ratio.\nCapital expenditures are considered part of both our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $2.8 million of recurring capital expenditures, which was a decrease of $0.7 million over the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $21.2 million of non-recurring capital expenditures, which was an increase of $6.7 million over the prior year. The increase in non-recurring capital expenditures is primarily due to an increase in our redevelopment and repositioning activity and the growth of our overall portfolio. As discussed above under -Factors that May Influence Future Results -Acquisitions and Development of Properties, as of December 31, 2016, seven of our properties were in various stages of redevelopment and repositioning or lease-up, and we anticipate beginning repositioning work on five additional properties during 2017. We currently estimate that approximately $83.3 million of capital will be required over the next seven quarters (1Q-2017 through 3Q-2018) to complete the redevelopment and repositioning of these 12 properties. However, this estimate is based on our current construction plan and budgets, both of which are subject to change as a result of a number of factors. If we are unable to complete construction on schedule or within budget, we could incur increased construction costs and experience potential delays in leasing the properties. We expect to fund these projects through a combination of cash flow from operations, borrowings available under the Revolver, and recycling capital through property dispositions.\n\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through net cash flow from operations, proceeds from long-term secured and unsecured financings, borrowings available under our unsecured revolving credit facility, the issuance of equity securities, including preferred stock, and proceeds from selective real estate dispositions as we identify capital recycling opportunities.\nGain from Early Repayment of Note Receivable\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio other income increased by $0.3 million, or 112.8%, and $0.7 million, or 230.0%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in late fee income.\nupon maturity and for other general corporate purposes. Any future issuance, however, is dependent upon market conditions, available pricing and capital needs and there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such offerings of securities.\n \u2022 Maintaining a minimum Fair Market Net Worth (as defined in the term loan agreement) of at least $75 million, to be tested annually as of December 31 of each year.  We were in compliance with all of our quarterly and annual debt covenants as of December 31, 2016.\n \u2022 Maintaining a ratio of total secured recourse debt to total asset value of not more than 15%; \nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our Same Properties Portfolio occupancy was approximately 96.1% and 93.0%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our Same Properties Portfolio weighted average occupancy was approximately 93.4% and 90.7%, respectively.\nOur Total Portfolio acquisition expenses decreased by $0.3 million, or 13.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to lower brokerage fees related to acquisitions completed during the current year.\n (1) Amount represents our 15% share of unconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K. \n \u2022 In April 2016, we completed a public follow-on offering of 10,350,000 shares of our common stock, including the underwriters exercise in full of its option to purchase 1,350,000 shares of our common stock, at an offering price of $17.65 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $174.4 million after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering costs. \n (3) One additional one-year extension is available, if certain conditions are satisfied. \nThe gain from early repayment of note receivable of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, represents the recognition of the unamortized accretable yield related to the collection of the Calle Perfecto Note.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement is guaranteed by the Company and by substantially all of the current and to-be-formed subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership that own an unencumbered property. The Amended Credit Agreement is not secured by the Company's properties or by equity interests in the subsidiaries that hold such properties.\nRecurring and Nonrecurring Capital Expenditures\n (2) Reflects the estimated payments to counterparties assuming that the 1-month LIBOR rate is equal to 0.7717% from the effective date through the maturity date of each respective interest rate swap. \nIf we attain one additional investment grade rating by one or more of Standard & Poor's or Moody's Investor Services to complement our current investment grade Fitch rating, we may elect to convert the pricing structure under the Amended Credit Agreement to be based on such rating. In that event, the margins for the Amended Revolver will range in amount from 0.825% to 1.550% for LIBOR-based loans and 0.00% to 0.55% for Base Rate-based loans, depending on such rating. The margins for the Amended Term Loan will range in amount from 0.90% to 1.75% for LIBOR-based loans and 0.00% to 0.75% for Base Rate-based loans, depending on such ratings.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur Total Portfolio general and administrative expenses increased by $2.9 million, or 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due to the following: (i) a $0.8 million increase in employee-related costs due to increased staffing levels from growth, (ii) a $0.8 million increase in non-cash equity compensation expense primarily due to restricted stock grants made during 2014 and 2015, (iii) a $0.7 million increase in professional audit, SOX compliance and tax fees, and (iv) a $0.9 million increase in various overhead costs, including rent and other professional services fees. This increase was partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in legal fee expenses.\n (2) Calculated as the change between GAAP rents for new or renewal leases and the expiring GAAP rents on the expiring leases for the same space. \n (4) As of December 31, 2016, this term loan has been effectively fixed at 3.817% through the use of two interest rate swaps as follows: (i) $30 million at 3.726% with an effective date of January 15, 2015, and (ii) $29.7 million at 3.91% with an effective date of July 15, 2015. \nOther Income\nOn February 14, 2017, we amended our $300 million unsecured credit facility (the Prior Credit Facility\u201d) by entering into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides for a $450 million senior unsecured credit facility, comprised of a $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Amended Revolver\u201d) and a $100 million unsecured term loan facility (the \"Amended Term Loan\"). The Amended Revolver is scheduled to mature on February 12, 2021, and has two six-month extension options available for a maximum maturity date of February 14, 2022, subject to certain conditions and the payment of an additional fee. The Amended Term Loan is scheduled to mature on February 14, 2022. Under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, we may request additional lender commitments up to an additional aggregate $550 million, which may be comprised of additional revolving commitments under the Amended Revolver, an increase to the Amended Term Loan, additional term loan tranches or any combination of the foregoing.\nNet cash provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $315.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and consisted primarily of $174.4 million in net cash proceeds raised from the issuance of 10.35 million shares of common stock, $86.7 million in net cash proceeds raised from the issuance of 3.6 million shares of preferred stock and gross proceeds of $225.0 million from borrowings made under the $225 Million Term Loan Facility, partially offset by the repayment of $140.5 million of net borrowings outstanding under the Prior Revolver and the payment of $36.0 million in dividends and distributions. Net cash provided by financing activities was $192.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and consisted primarily of $176.2 million in net proceeds raised from the issuance of 11.5 million shares of common stock, proceeds of $100.0 million received from the issuance of the Notes and net borrowings of $48.0 million on the Prior Revolver, partially offset by the repayment of three secured loans aggregating $101.4 million, the payment of $27.1 million in dividends and distributions, and the payment of $0.8 million related to new borrowings.\n \u2022 Maintaining Unencumbered Liquid Assets (as defined in the term loan agreement) of not less than (i) $5 million, or (ii) $8 million if we elect to have Line of Credit Availability (as defined in the term loan agreement) included in the calculation, of which $2 million must be cash or cash equivalents, to be tested annually as of December 31 of each year; \nSources of Liquidity\nOur Total Portfolio interest income decreased by $0.3 million, or 35.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016, relates to a $6.0 million mortgage loan that we made on July 1, 2016, that is secured by an industrial property located in Rancho Cucamonga, California and that bears interest at 10.0% per annum. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015, relates to a mortgage note receivable that was repaid on August 21, 2015, ahead of its scheduled maturity. The mortgage note receivable was secured by an industrial property located at 32401-32803 Calle Perfecto (the Calle Perfecto Note\u201d) and bore interest at 6.001% per annum.\n \u2022 For the Amended Credit Agreement, maintaining a minimum tangible net worth of at least the sum of (i) $760,740,750 and (ii) an amount equal to at least 75% of the net equity proceeds received by the Company after September 30, 2016; \nIn addition to the interest payable on amounts outstanding under the Amended Revolver, we are required to pay an applicable facility fee, based upon our leverage ratio, on the aggregate amount of each lender's Revolving Credit Commitment (whether or not such Revolving Credit Commitment is drawn), as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement. The applicable facility fee will range in amount from 0.15% to 0.30%, depending on our leverage ratio. In the event that we convert the pricing structure to be based on an investment-grade rating, the applicable facility fee will range in amount from 0.125% to 0.30%, depending on such rating.\npremium or penalty. Amounts borrowed under the Amended Term Loan and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue increased $0.7 million, or 7.1%, and increased $6.2 million or 59.6%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio tenant reimbursements is primarily due to the lease-up of completed triple net repositioning properties during 2015 and supplemental assessments of certain of our properties resulting in lower reimbursable real estate taxes during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue was also impacted by the incremental reimbursements from the 41 properties we acquired during 2015 and 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our consolidated portfolio consisted of 136 properties with approximately 15.0 million rentable square feet. In addition, we currently manage an additional 19 properties with approximately 1.2 million rentable square feet.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement contains usual and customary events of default including defaults in the payment of principal, interest or fees, defaults in compliance with the covenants set forth in the Amended Credit Facility and other loan documentation, cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness, and bankruptcy and other insolvency defaults. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Amended Credit Facility, the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans, together with all accrued unpaid interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, may be declared immediately due and payable.\n (5) 9615 Norwalk has 10.26 acres of partially paved storage yard/industrial land that is currently under a month-to-month lease. We plan to construct a new building with approximately 200,000 rentable square feet after the month-to-month lease terminates. \nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases is affected by economic and competitive conditions in our markets and by the desirability of our individual properties, which may impact our results of operations.\nIn determining the fair value of intangible lease assets or liabilities, we also consider Level 3 inputs. Acquired above- and below-market leases are valued based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in-place rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases, if applicable. The estimated fair value of acquired in-place at-market tenant leases are the costs that would have been incurred to lease the property to the occupancy level of the property at the date of acquisition. Such estimates include the value associated with leasing commissions, legal and other costs, as well as the estimated period necessary to lease such property that would be incurred to lease the property to its occupancy level at the time of its acquisition. In determining the fair value for acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2016, we used an estimated average lease-up period ranging from six to twelve months. Acquisition costs associated with business combinations are expensed in the period they are incurred.\nOur Same Properties Portfolio property expenses decreased by $0.2 million or 1.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, and as a percentage of total rental revenues decreased to 27.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 28.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a decrease in recoverable expenses including utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, and real estate tax expense resulting from supplemental assessments of certain of our properties, partially offset by an increase in non-recoverable overhead costs. Our Total Portfolio property expenses increased by $6.6 million, or 36.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the incremental expenses from the 57 properties we acquired during 2014 and 2015.\nInvestment in Real Estate\nRental Revenue\nDebt Covenants\n \u2022 Maintaining a ratio of adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) to fixed charges of at least 1.50 to 1.0; \nGeneral and Administrative\nCompany Overview\nMarket Fundamentals\nManagement, Leasing and Development Services\nOur Same Properties Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2.8 million, or 13.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to acquired lease related intangible and tangible assets for several of our properties becoming fully depreciated during 2015 and 2014. Our Total Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense increased $13.2 million, or 46.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the 57 properties we acquired during 2014 and 2015.\nRecoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. To review real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. The intent with regards to the underlying assets might change as market conditions and other factors change. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property, quoted market values and third party appraisals, where considered necessary. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan used to manage our underlying business. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we will recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our consolidated portfolio was 91.7% occupied. We believe the opportunity to increase occupancy at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth. An opportunity to drive this growth will derive from the lease-up of recently completed repositioning projects and the completion and lease-up of repositioning projects that are currently under construction and planned for near-term construction.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we repaid the $48.5 million term loan secured by eight of our properties and the mortgage loan encumbering the property located at 2980-2990 San Fernando Road. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million represents the write-off of $0.3 million of unamortized deferred loan costs related to the term loan, partially offset by the write-off of the $0.1 million unamortized loan premium related to the mortgage loan. We repaid both loans in advance of the maturity date without incurring prepayment fees.\nOur Total Portfolio management, leasing and development services revenue decreased by $0.1 million, or 19.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to our acquisition of the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from our unconsolidated joint venture in July 2016. Prior to this acquisition, we earned fees and commissions for providing property and construction management services for the property.\nIn Los Angeles County, we saw positive market trends in 2016, as record high occupancy levels continued year-over-year, and asking lease rates increased at a stable pace during 2016. We expect that rents will continue to improve through 2017, as occupancy is at near capacity levels and new development is limited by a lack of land availability and an increase in land and development costs.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in net cash flows associated with our operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nThe loss on sale of real estate of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, relates to the disposition of our property located at 500-560 Zenith Drive, in Glenview, Illinois ( Zenith Drive\u201d). We adopted ASU 2014-08: Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity ( ASU 2014-08\u201d), beginning with the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2014. Under ASU 2014-08, only disposals that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the entity's results and operations would qualify as discontinued operations. The disposal of Zenith Drive did not meet the criteria to be classified in discontinued operations, and as such, the loss on sale of real estate is included in continuing operations.\n \u2022 In January 2016, we closed on a seven-year $125 million unsecured term loan facility that will mature in January 2023. The term loan facility bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable Eurodollar rate margin that will range from 1.50% to 2.25% per annum depending on our leverage ratio. \nInterest Income\nFor the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our Same Properties Portfolio includes all properties in our industrial portfolio that were wholly-owned by us as of January 1, 2014, and still owned by us as of December 31, 2015, which consisted of 62 properties aggregating approximately 6.1 million rentable square feet. Results for our Same Properties Portfolio exclude our JV properties, any properties that were acquired or sold during 2015 or 2014, interest income from our note receivable, and corporate general and administrative expenses. For the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our Total Portfolio includes the properties in our Same Properties Portfolio, the 57 properties aggregating approximately 5.9 million rentable square feet that were acquired during 2015 and 2014, and the three properties aggregating approximately 0.2 million rentable square feet that were sold during 2014.\nAcquisitions\nInterest Income\nNet cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $15.9 million to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to incremental cash flows from property acquisitions completed after January 1, 2015, and the increase in Cash NOI from our Same Properties Portfolio, partially offset by higher cash interest paid for comparable periods.\nThe Amended Revolver and the Amended Term Loan may be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part at any time without\nWe allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of a property by valuing the property as if it were vacant. This as-if vacant\u201d value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow approach that relies upon Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs based on our assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use. These Level 3 inputs include discount rates, capitalization rates, market rents and comparable sales data for similar properties. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. In calculating the as-if-vacant\u201d value for acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2016, we used discount rates ranging from 6.00% and 8.50% and capitalization rates ranging from 5.25% to 7.50%.\nLeases representing 16.3% and 12.6% of the aggregate rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we renewed 283 leases, or 58.6% of the number of leases scheduled to expire, which represented 64.2% of the aggregate rentable square footage under all expiring leases. Our retention rate during the year was impacted by our strategy to roll certain tenants at recessionary rents and to replace them with higher quality tenants paying higher rents. New and renewal leases signed during the current year had a weighted average term of 4.3 and 3.5 years, respectively, and we expect future new and renewal leases to have similar terms.\nOur operating results depend upon the infill Southern California industrial real estate market.\nOn April 15, 2016, we completed a public follow-on offering (the Equity Offering\u201d) of 10,350,000 shares of our common stock, including the underwriters exercise in full of its option to purchase an additional 1,350,000 shares of our common stock, at an offering price of $17.65 per share. The net proceeds were approximately $174.4 million, after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering costs totaling $8.3 million. A portion of the net proceeds from the Equity Offering were used to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, which had an outstanding balance of $62.5 million on April 15, 2016, the date of repayment, and to partially fund the REIT Portfolio Acquisition as discussed below under -Uses of Liquidity- REIT Portfolio Acquisition.\n (4) The GAAP and cash re-leasing spreads for new leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2016, exclude 82 leases aggregating 1,057,003 rentable square feet for which space was vacant when the property was acquired or there was no comparable lease data. Comparable leases generally exclude: (i) space that has never been occupied under our ownership, (ii) recently repositioned/redeveloped space, (iii) space that has been vacant for over one year, (iv) space with different lease structures (for example a change from a gross lease to a modified gross lease or an increase or decrease in the leased square footage) or (v) space with lease terms shorter than six months. \nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $124.4 million to $361.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $236.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to the $139.1 million increase in cash paid for property acquisitions and the $9.7 million increase in cash paid for construction and repositioning projects for comparable periods, partially offset by aggregate net proceeds of $38.5 million received from five real estate dispositions completed during 2016.\n (2) Excludes unamortized deferred loan fees and net debt premiums aggregating $2.3 million as of December 31, 2016. \nConsolidated Indebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nWe recognize revenue from rent, tenant reimbursements and other revenue sources once all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, the delivery has occurred or services rendered, the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Minimum annual rental revenues are recognized in rental revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession or controls the physical use of the leased space.\nIn San Diego, the market fundamentals continued to be strong during 2016, as asking lease rates increased to a record high and overall vacancy in the market decreased to an all-time low.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue decreased $0.1 million, or 2.1%, and increased $2.8 million or 36.8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in our Same Properties Portfolio tenant reimbursements is directly related to the decrease in real estate taxes resulting from supplemental assessments of certain of our properties, as described below under property expenses, as well as lower reimbursements resulting from the completion of prior year recoverable expense reconciliations for comparable periods. Our Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements primarily increased due to the incremental reimbursements from the 57 properties we acquired during 2014 and 2015.\nIncome from discontinued operations of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, is comprised primarily of the gain on sale of our property located at 1335 Park Center Drive, partially offset by the loss on sale of our property located at 2900 N. Madera Road.\nOur Same Properties Portfolio interest expense decreased by $0.5 million, or 48.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the repayment of the outstanding mortgages encumbering the Glendale Commerce Center during August 2015 and the property located at 10700 Jersey Boulevard during October 2014. Our Total Portfolio interest expense increased by $2.1 million, or 32.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily due to the increase in our weighted average interest rate resulting from the issuance of $100 million of 4.29% fixed rate senior notes in August 2015 and the three interest rate swaps that were in effect during the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as the increase in our average outstanding debt balances. The increase was partially offset by the mortgage repayments noted above and an increase in capitalized interest due to increased construction activity on our repositioning properties during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe believe that earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of our operating performance as a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of our industrial properties. We also use this measure in ratios to compare our performance to that of our industry peers. However, our industry peers may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner as we do and, accordingly, our EBITDA may not be comparable to our peers' EBITDA. Accordingly, EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $15.5 million, and we did not have any amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility, leaving $200.0 million available for additional borrowings.\n (7) The property located at 18118-18120 S. Broadway includes three buildings. We plan to reposition one building with 18,033 rentable square feet when the current tenant vacates in 1Q-2017. \nAs of December 31, 2016, our Operating Partnership indirectly and wholly owns Rexford Industrial Realty and Management, Inc., which we refer to as the services company. We have elected, together with our services company, to treat our services company as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary generally may provide non-customary and other services to our tenants and engage in activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a REIT, provided a taxable REIT subsidiary may not operate or manage a lodging facility or health care facility or provide rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated. We may form additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future, and our Operating Partnership may contribute some or all of its interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries or their assets to our services company. Any income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not be included in our taxable income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, except to the extent such income is distributed to us as a dividend, in which case such dividend income will qualify under the 95%, but not the 75%, gross income test. Because a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax, and state and local income tax (where applicable) as a\n (4) During the year ended December 31, 2016, we completed construction and leased-up three units totaling 60,667 rentable square feet. We expect to complete construction and lease-up the remaining 14,000 rentable square foot unit during 1Q-2017. \nThe following table summarizes the composition of our consolidated debt between fixed-rate and variable-rate and secured and unsecured debt as of December 31, 2016:\n \u2022 In February 2016, we executed a forward interest swap that will effectively fix the $125 million unsecured term loan facility at 1.349% plus an applicable margin from February 14, 2018, to January 14, 2022. \nThe majority of our leases are either triple net or provide for tenant reimbursement for costs related to real estate taxes and operating expenses. In addition, most of the leases provide for fixed rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases to real estate taxes, utility expenses and other operating expenses may be partially offset by the contractual rent increases and tenant payment of taxes and expenses described above. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOur Total Portfolio general and administrative expenses increased by $2.4 million, or 16.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to the following: (i) a $2.0 million increase in non-cash equity compensation expense primarily due to equity grants made in December 2015, (ii) a $0.9 million increase in bonus expense due to Company performance, (iii) a $0.7 million increase in payroll and employment related costs primarily due to an increase in headcount, (iv) a $0.4 million increase in other various corporate expenses and (v) a $0.4 million increase in professional service and consulting fees. These increases were partially offset by the following: (i) a $1.6 million decrease in legal fees, which includes a $1.0 million insurance reimbursement of legal fees related to prior litigation received during the year ended December 31, 2016, and (ii) a $0.5 million decrease in professional audit, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance and tax fees.\nThe occupancy rate of properties not undergoing repositioning is affected by regional and local economic conditions in our Southern California infill markets. Throughout 2016, the Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego county markets have continued to show historically low vacancy and positive absorption, resulting from high tenant demand combined with low product availability. Accordingly, our properties in these markets have exhibited a similar trend. We expect general market conditions to remain positive in 2017, and we believe the opportunity to increase occupancy and rental rates at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth.\nREIT Portfolio Acquisition\nOur goal is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders by providing superior access to industrial property investments and mortgage debt secured by industrial property in Southern California infill markets. Our target markets provide us with opportunities to acquire both stabilized properties generating favorable cash flow, as well as properties where we can enhance returns through value-add renovations and redevelopment. Scarcity of available space and high barriers limiting new construction of for-lease product all contribute to create superior long-term supply/demand fundamentals within our target infill Southern California industrial property markets. With our vertically integrated platform and extensive value-add investment and management capabilities, we believe we are in a position to capitalize upon the opportunities in our markets to achieve our objectives.\nWe anticipate continuing to selectively dispose of properties, however, the timing of any potential future dispositions will depend on market conditions and our capital needs. Our ability to dispose of selective properties on advantageous terms, or at all, is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable.\n (1) Based on the 1-month LIBOR rate of 0.7717%, as of December 31, 2016. \n\nCash Flow from Operations\n (3) Calculated as the change between cash rents for new or renewal leases and the expiring cash rents on the expiring leases for the same space. \nour cash flow on a quarterly basis to holders of our common stock. In addition, we intend to make distribution payments to holders of OP Units and dividend payments to holders of our preferred stock.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nIn order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. To satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT and generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, we intend to distribute a percentage of\nAcquisitions and Development of Properties\n \u2022 During 2016, we completed the sale of five of our properties with a combined 310,871 rentable square feet, for a total gross sales price of $40.7 million. The net cash proceeds, which totaled $38.5 million, were reinvested as part of three separate 1031 Exchange transactions.  Equity\n (1) Effective rent per square foot is the average base rent calculated in accordance with GAAP, over the term of the lease, expressed in dollars per square foot per year. Includes all new and renewal leases executed during each respective quarter. \nEstimated reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period that the recoverable expenses are incurred. Subsequent to year-end, we perform final reconciliations on a lease-by-lease basis and bill or credit each tenant for any cumulative annual adjustments. Lease\nCash flow from operations is one of our key sources of liquidity and is primarily dependent upon: (i) the occupancy levels and lease rates at our properties, (ii) our ability to collect rent, (iii) the level of operating costs we incur and (iv) our ability to pass through operating expenses to our tenants. We are subject to a number of risks related to general economic and other unpredictable conditions, which have the potential to affect our overall performance and resulting cash flows from operations. However, based on our current portfolio mix and business strategy, we anticipate that we will be able to generate positive cash flows from operations.\n\nOur consolidated results of operations are often not comparable from period to period due to the effect of property acquisitions and dispositions completed during the comparative reporting periods. Our Total Portfolio\u201d represents all of the properties owned during the reported periods. To eliminate the effect of changes in our Total Portfolio due to acquisitions and dispositions and to highlight the operating results of our on-going business, we have separately presented the results of our Same Properties Portfolio.\u201d\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe difference between the fair value and the face value of debt assumed in connection with an acquisition is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized to interest expense\u201d over the life of the debt assumed. The valuation of assumed liabilities is based on our estimate of the current market rates for similar liabilities in effect at the acquisition date.\nTenant Reimbursements\n (3) Includes total commitments for tenant improvement and construction work related to obligations under certain tenant leases and vendor contracts. We anticipate these obligations to be paid as incurred in 2017 and 2018, however, as the timing of these obligations is subject to a number of factors, for purposes of this table, we have included the full amount under 2017.\u201d  Dividends and Distributions\nWe continuously evaluate opportunities for the potential disposition of properties in our portfolio when we believe such disposition is appropriate in view of our business objectives. In evaluating these opportunities, we consider a variety of criteria including, but not limited to, local market conditions and lease rates, asset type and location, as well as potential uses of proceeds and tax considerations. Tax considerations include entering into tax-deferred like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code ( 1031 Exchange\u201d), when possible, to defer some or all of the taxable gains, if any, on dispositions.\nThe following table sets forth our principal obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016, including (i) scheduled principal payments and debt maturities, (ii) periodic interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness and interest rate swaps, (iii) office and ground lease payments and (iv) other contractual obligations (in thousands):\nDepreciation and Amortization\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\n (3) Noncontrolling interest represent holders of outstanding common units of our Operating Partnership that are owned by unit holders other than Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a total gain of $17.4 million from the disposition of five properties that were sold for an aggregate gross sales price of $40.7 million.\nThe Notes contain a series of financial and other covenants with which we must comply. The financial covenants, which are tested on a quarterly basis, are the same as those that we must comply with under the $225 Million Term Loan Facility, as detailed above. Subject to the terms of the Notes, upon certain events of default, including, but not limited to, (i) a default in the payment of any principal, make-whole payment amount, or interest under the Notes, (ii) a default in the payment of certain of our other indebtedness, (iii) a default in compliance with the covenants set forth in the Notes agreement and (iv) bankruptcy and other insolvency defaults, the principal and accrued and unpaid interest and the make-whole payment amount on the outstanding Notes will become due and payable at the option of the purchasers.\n\nOur Total Portfolio management, leasing and development services revenue decreased by $0.3 million, or 32.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily due to lower management fees from the JV as a result of the sale of two of the three buildings owned by the JV in November 2014.\n \u2022 Maintaining a Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the term loan agreement) of at least 1.10 to 1.00, to be tested quarterly; \nValuation of Receivables\nWhen we acquire operating properties with the intention to hold the investment for the long-term, and such acquisitions meet the accounting criteria to be accounted for as business combinations, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The components typically include land, building and improvements, tenant improvements, intangible assets related to above and below market leases, intangible assets related to in-place leases, debt and other assumed assets and liabilities. Because of the timing or complexity of completing certain fair value adjustments, the initial purchase price allocation may be incomplete at the end of a reporting period, in which case we may record provisional purchase price allocation amounts based on information available at the acquisition date. Subsequent adjustments to provisional amounts are recognized during the measurement period, which cannot exceed one year from the date of acquisition.\n (1) Amount represents our 15% share of unconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K. \n\n (1) The estimated construction completion period is subject to change as a result of a number of factors including but not limited to permit requirements, delays in construction, changes in scope, and other unforeseen circumstances. \n\n \u2022 In May 2016, we executed a forward interest swap that will effectively fix the incremental $100 million term loan at 1.406% plus an applicable margin from August 14, 2018, to January 14, 2022. \n\nEquity Offerings\nOther Income\n$225 Million Term Loan Facility\nProperty Expenses\nInflation\nDuring 2015, we obtained investment grade ratings of BBB- from Fitch Ratings on our Prior Credit Facility and $100 million guaranteed senior notes (the Notes\u201d). In April 2016, we also obtained the same rating on our $225 Million Term Loan Facility. These were most recently affirmed in August 2016, with a stable outlook. In August 2016, we also obtained an investment grade rating of BB from Fitch Ratings on the Series A Preferred Stock. Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. In the event our current credit ratings are downgraded, it may become difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing indebtedness as maturities become due.\nOur leasing activity is impacted both by our redevelopment and repositioning efforts, as well as by market conditions. While we reposition a property, its space may become unavailable for leasing until completion of our repositioning efforts. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we completed repositioning at five of our properties located at 9401 De Soto Avenue, 679-691 S. Anderson Street, 24105 Frampton Avenue, 12247 Lakeland Road and 15140 & 15148 Bledsoe Street, and at the end of 2015, we completed repositioning at our property located at 2610 & 2701 S. Birch Street. As of December 31, 2016, our properties located at 9401 De Soto Avenue and 679-691 S. Anderson Street were in the lease-up stage. We also have one\nResults of Operations\nOn April 11, 2016, we entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d) to acquire a private real estate investment trust that owns a portfolio of nine industrial properties totaling approximately 1.53 million rentable square feet, from a third-party seller in exchange for approximately $191.0 million in cash, exclusive of closing costs (the REIT Portfolio Acquisition\u201d).\nOur rental expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, site repair and maintenance costs, and the allocation of overhead costs. For the majority of our properties, our property expenses are recovered, in part, by either the triple net provisions or modified gross expense reimbursements in tenant leases. The majority of our leases also comprise contractual three percent annual rental rate increases meant, in part, to help mitigate potential increases in property expenses over time. However, the terms of our leases vary and in some instances we may absorb property expenses. Our overall financial results will be impacted by the extent to which we are able to pass-through property expenses to our tenants.\n \u2022 During December 2016, we sold a total of 571,368 shares of our common stock under our ATM Program, of which 168,685 shares were settled in January 2017, for gross proceeds of $13.2 million, or approximately $23.14 per share, and net proceeds of approximately $13.0 million after deducting the sales agents' fee.  Financing\nAs of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we had borrowings of $115 million outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement, including $15 million drawn on the Amended Revolver and $100 million under the Amended Term Loan.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nAt December 31, 2016, we had total indebtedness of approximately $502.5 million, reflecting a net debt to total combined market capitalization of approximately 22.6%. Our total combined market capitalization is defined as the sum of the liquidation value of our preferred stock plus the market value of our common stock excluding shares of nonvested restricted stock, plus the aggregate value of common units not owned by us, plus the value of our net debt. Our net debt is defined as our consolidated indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents.\nHighlights\nFor acquisitions that do not meet the accounting criteria to be accounted for as a business combination, we allocate the cost of the acquisition, which includes any associated acquisition costs, to the individual assets (typically land and building) and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. We capitalized total acquisition costs of $0.2 million, $0.7 million and $0.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGain on Sale of Real Estate\nNOI on a cash-basis (Cash NOI) is a non-GAAP measure, which we calculate by adding or subtracting from NOI (i) fair value lease revenue and (ii) straight-line rent adjustments. We use Cash NOI, together with NOI, as a supplemental performance measure. Cash NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. Cash NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\n\nLeasing Activity and Rental Rates\nThe leases scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2018, represent 17.8% and 14.5%, respectively, of the total annualized base rent for our portfolio as of December 31, 2016. We estimate that, on a weighted average basis, in-place rents of leases scheduled to expire in 2017 and 2018 are currently below current market asking rents, although individual units or properties within any particular submarket presently may be leased either above, below, or at the current market asking rates within that submarket. Over the last few years, rental rates for comparable product in our submarkets have generally been rising. This positive trend offers a favorable environment for additional increases in lease renewal rates. Accordingly, we expect 2017 will show positive renewal rates and leasing spreads. We also currently do not see any reason not to expect that 2018 lease expirations will show positive growth upon renewal; however, it is difficult to predict market conditions that far into the future.\nWe capitalized interest costs of $1.7 million, $0.8 million and $42 thousand during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We capitalized real estate taxes and insurance aggregating $0.8 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We capitalized compensation costs for employees who provide construction services of $1.0 million, $0.9 million and $0.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe calculate funds from operations ( FFO\u201d) attributable to common stockholders in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures.\nroll-over or that provide opportunities to add-value through functional or physical repositioning and improvements. Through various redevelopment, repositioning, and professional leasing and marketing strategies, we seek to increase the properties' functionality and attractiveness to prospective tenants and, over time, to stabilize the properties at occupancy and lease rates that meet or exceed market rates.\nOn August 16, 2016, we completed a public offering of 3,600,000 shares of our 5.875% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the Series A Preferred Stock\u201d) at a price of $25.00 per share. The net proceeds from the preferred offering were approximately $86.7 million, after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering costs totaling $3.3 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering to fund various acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio other income decreased by $0.3 million, or 32.6%, and $0.1 million, or 6.9%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in our Same Properties Portfolio other income is primarily due to a decrease in filming income at one of our properties and a decrease in late fee income and other miscellaneous tenant income. The decrease in our Total Portfolio income is primarily due to a decrease in miscellaneous tenant income.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to FFO (in thousands):\n (2) Excludes unamortized deferred loan fees and net debt premiums aggregating $2.3 million as of December 31, 2016.  As of December 31, 2016, we had total indebtedness, excluding unamortized deferred loan fees and net debt premiums, of $502.5 million, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.29% and an average term-to-maturity of 5.3 years. As of December 31, 2016, $277.5 million, or 55%, of our outstanding indebtedness had an interest rate that was effectively fixed under either the terms of the loan ($117.8 million) or an interest rate swap ($159.7 million). We have two interest rate swaps that will effectively fix the interest on the $225 Million Term Loan Facility as follows: (i) $125 million at 1.349% plus the applicable LIBOR margin from February 14, 2018, to January 14, 2022, and (ii) $100 million at 1.406% plus the applicable LIBOR margin from August 14, 2018, to January 14, 2022. If these two interest rate swaps were effective as of December 31, 2016, our consolidated debt would be 100% fixed-rate and 0% variable-rate.\n (1) Includes the effect of interest rate swaps that were effective as of December 31, 2016. Excludes the effect of amortization of deferred loan fees, discounts/premiums and the unused commitment fee on the $200 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Assumes a 1-month LIBOR rate of 0.7717% as of December 31, 2016, as applicable. \nInterest Expense\n (2) For the year ended December 31, 2016, the gain relates to the Company's acquisition of the remaining 85% ownership interest in the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from the JV. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K. \nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nRevenues from management, leasing and development services are recognized when the related services have been provided and earned.\n\nWe capitalize direct costs incurred in developing, renovating, rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis. This includes certain general and administrative costs, including payroll, bonus, and non-cash equity compensation of the personnel performing development, renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are identifiable to a specific activity to get the real estate asset ready for its intended use. During the development and construction periods of a project, we also capitalize interest, real estate taxes and insurance costs. We cease capitalization of costs upon substantial completion of the project, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. If some portions of a project are substantially complete and ready for use and other portions have not yet reached that stage, we cease capitalizing costs on the completed portion of the project but continue to capitalize for the incomplete portion of the project. Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe following table summarizes the cash flows of Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nOn February 14, 2017, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.145 per share of common stock and a quarterly cash distribution of $0.145 per OP Unit, to be paid on April 17, 2017, to holders of record as of March 31, 2017. Also on February 14, 2017, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36719 per share of the Series A Preferred Stock, to be paid on March 31, 2017, to preferred stockholders of record as of March 15, 2017.\nRental Revenue\nOccupancy Rates\nThe following critical accounting policies discussion reflects what we believe are the most significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this report on Form 10-K.\nOur $60 million amortizing term loan contains the following financial covenants:\nCash Flows\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio rental revenue increased by $2.1 million, or 4.6%, and $24.5 million, or 43.2%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio is primarily due to the increase in our average occupancy for comparable periods and the increase in average rental rates on new and renewal leases. Our Total Portfolio rental revenue was also positively impacted by the revenues from the 57 properties we acquired during 2014 and 2015.\nAcquisitions\nLastly, in the Inland Empire, new industrial product continues to be absorbed well in the market. In the Inland Empire West, which contains infill markets in which we operate, vacancy remained low and asking lease rates increased significantly year-over-year. We expect the outlook for the Inland Empire West to remain positive over the upcoming year. We generally do not focus on properties located within the non-infill Inland Empire East sub-market.\nThe infill Southern California industrial real estate sector has continued to exhibit strong fundamentals. Available industrial supply continues to decrease in many of our target infill submarkets, landlord concessions are reducing and construction deliveries are falling short of demand. Meanwhile, underlying tenant demand within our infill markets continues to demonstrate growth, illustrated or driven by strong re-leasing spreads, an expanding regional population, substantial growth in e-commerce transaction and delivery volumes as well as further compression of delivery time-frames. Even with concerns about global growth, potential changes to trade and tariff policies and the threat of rising interest rates, we are seeing a number of positive trends in some of our key markets that we expect will continue into the upcoming year.\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Measure: Funds From Operations\nA critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity's financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management. Generally, the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by the users of our financial statements in their evaluation of our performance.\n (4) Participating securities include unvested shares of restricted stock, unvested LTIP units of partnership interest in our Operating Partnership and unvested performance units in our Operating Partnership. \nOn April 17, 2015, we established the ATM Program pursuant to which we may issue and sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $125.0 million of our common stock through sales agents. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have sold 571,868 shares of common stock under the ATM Program for aggregate gross proceeds of $13.2 million, leaving us with the capacity to issue up to $111.8 million of additional shares. Future sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, determinations by us of the appropriate sources of funding for us and potential uses of funding available to us. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of shares under the ATM Program, if any, to fund potential acquisition opportunities, repay amounts outstanding from time to time under our unsecured revolving credit facility or other debt financing obligations, to fund our development or redevelopment activities and/or for general corporate purposes.\nOur Total Portfolio interest income decreased by $0.4 million, or 36.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. On August 21, 2015, the borrower of the Calle Perfecto Note repaid the outstanding principal balance ahead of its schedule maturity. The decrease in interest income is a result of this early repayment.\nIn Ventura County, there was a slight increase in vacancy and a slight decrease in asking lease rates year-over-year.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $143.8 million to $236.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $380.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $153.1 million decrease in cash paid for property acquisitions for comparable periods, partially offset by the increase in cash paid for construction and repositioning projects of $8.2 million for comparable periods.\n\nThe $225 Million Term Loan Facility and the Amended Credit Agreement both include a series of financial and other covenants that we must comply with, including the following covenants which are tested on a quarterly basis:\nRexford Industrial Realty, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed full-service REIT focused on owning and operating industrial properties in Southern California infill markets. We were formed as a Maryland corporation on January 18, 2013 and Rexford Industrial Realty, L.P. (the Operating Partnership\u201d), of which we are the sole general partner, was formed as a Maryland limited partnership on January 18, 2013. Through our controlling interest in our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, we own, manage, lease, acquire and develop industrial real estate primarily located in Southern California infill markets, and from time to time, acquire or provide mortgage debt secured by industrial property. We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under the Code, and generally are not subject to federal taxes on our income to the extent we distribute our income to our shareholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT.\n \u2022 Maintaining a ratio of secured debt to total asset value of not more than 45%; \n\ntermination fees, which are included in rental revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, are recognized when the related lease is canceled and we have no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenant.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our Same Properties Portfolio occupancy was approximately 94.4% and 92.8%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our Same Properties Portfolio weighted average occupancy was approximately 93.2% and 91.0%, respectively.\nOur operating results depend primarily upon generating rental revenue from the properties in our consolidated portfolio. The amount of rental revenue generated by these properties is affected by our ability to maintain or increase occupancy levels and rental rates at our properties, which will depend upon our ability to lease vacant space and re-lease expiring space at favorable rates.\nThe properties in our portfolio are located primarily in Southern California infill markets. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in this market may affect our overall performance.\nNet cash provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $192.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and consisted primarily of net proceeds of $176.2 million from the issuance of 11.5 million shares of common stock (including the underwriters exercise in full of its option to purchase an additional 1,500,000 shares of our common stock), $100 million proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and net borrowings of $48.0 million on the Prior Revolver, partially offset by the repayment of three secured loans aggregating $101.4 million, the payment of $27.1 million in dividends and distributions, and the payment of $0.8 million of deferred loan costs related to new borrowings. Net cash provided by financing activities was $355.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and consisted primarily of net proceeds of $221.8 million from the issuance of 17.25 million shares of common stock, the receipt of $148.5 million from two term loan borrowings, and net borrowings of $11.1 million on our Prior Revolver, partially offset by the payment of $18.4 million in dividends and distributions, the repayment of the $5.0 million note secured by one of our properties and the payment of $1.9 million of deferred loan costs related to new borrowings.\n (5) The applicable LIBOR margin will range from 1.25% to 1.85% for the $100 million term loan facility, 1.30% to 1.90% for the $200 million unsecured revolving credit facility and 1.50% to 2.25% for the $225 Million Term Loan Facility, depending on the ratio of our outstanding consolidated indebtedness to the value of our consolidated gross asset value. This ratio is measured on a quarterly basis, and as a result, the effective interest rate will fluctuate from period to period. \nProperty Expenses\nAcquisition Expenses\n (3) The property located at 228th Street includes eight buildings, of which three buildings aggregating 23,749 rentable square feet were under repositioning as of December 31, 2016. \n\nOur Total Portfolio acquisition expenses increased by $0.1 million, or 4.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased brokerage fees related to acquisitions completed during the current year.\nWe are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables. In order to mitigate these risks, we perform credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed and on existing tenants before properties are acquired. We specifically analyze aged receivables, customer credit-worthiness, historical bad debts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. As a result of our periodic analysis, we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments. This estimate requires significant judgment related to the lessees' ability to fulfill their obligations under the leases. We believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate for our outstanding receivables for the periods presented. If a tenant is insolvent or files for bankruptcy protection and fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the net outstanding balances, which include amounts recognized as straight-line revenue not realizable until future periods.\nConditions in Our Markets\nAcquisitions\nCapitalization of Costs\nA key component of our growth strategy is to acquire properties through off-market and lightly marketed transactions that are often operating at below-market occupancy or below-market rent at the time of acquisition or that have near-term lease\nOne of our most significant liquidity needs has historically been for the acquisition of real estate properties. As part of our growth strategy, we are actively monitoring a volume of properties in our markets that we believe represent attractive potential investment opportunities. While the actual number of acquisitions that we complete will be dependent upon a number of factors, in the short term, we expect to fund our acquisitions through available cash on hand, cash flows from operations, borrowings available under the Amended Revolver, recycling capital through property dispositions and, in the long term, through the issuance of equity securities or proceeds from long-term secured and unsecured financings. On February 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of a single-tenant industrial property for a contract price of $17.1 million. The acquisition was funded using available cash on hand and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nWe have the option to voluntarily prepay any amounts borrowed under the $225 Million Term Loan Facility in whole or in part at any time, subject to certain notice requirements. To the extent that we prepay all or any portion of a loan on or prior to January 14, 2018, we will pay a prepayment premium equal to (i) if such prepayment occurs prior to January 14, 2017, 2.00% of the principal amount so prepaid and (ii) if such prepayment occurs on or after January 14, 2017, but prior to January 14, 2018, 1.00% of the principal amount so prepaid. Amounts borrowed under the $225 Million Term Loan Facility and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We have summarized below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on financial condition and results of operations. Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions that it believes are reasonable as of the date hereof. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those of other companies.\nregular corporation, the income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally will be subject to an additional level of tax as compared to the income earned by our other subsidiaries. Our taxable REIT subsidiary is a C-corporation subject to federal and state income tax, however it has a cumulative unrecognized net operation loss carryforward and therefore there is no income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nProperty Expenses\n (8) As of December 31, 2016, we have executed two interest rate swaps that will effectively fix the interest on the $225 Million Term Loan Facility as follows: (i) $125 million at 1.349% plus the applicable LIBOR margin from February 14, 2018, to January 14, 2022, and (ii) $100 million at 1.406% plus the applicable LIBOR margin from August 14, 2018, to January 14, 2022. \nUses of Liquidity\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to EBITDA (in thousands):\n (8) We plan to reposition 107,965 rentable square feet of warehouse space at this property when the current tenant vacates in 2Q-2017. \nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\n \u2022 In April 2016, we exercised the accordion that was available to us under the $125 million unsecured term loan facility and established a new incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $100 million. \nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for operating expenses, interest expense, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, and distributions to our common and preferred stockholders and holders of common units of partnership interests in our Operating Partnership ( OP Units\u201d). We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through available cash on hand, cash flow from operations, by drawing on our unsecured revolving credit facility and by issuing shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Program described below.\nEquity in Income from Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities\n \u2022 During 2016, we acquired 20 properties, aggregating 3.4 million square feet, for an aggregate cost of $371.7 million, of which four properties aggregating 0.8 million square feet were considered value-add acquisitions.  Repositioning\nCritical Accounting Policies\nHowever, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate or interpret FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nRental Revenue\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we repaid the $48.5 million term loan secured by eight of our properties and the mortgage loan encumbering the property located at 2980-2990 San Fernando Road. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million represents the write-off of $0.3 million of unamortized deferred loan costs related to the term loan, partially offset by the write-off of the $0.1 million unamortized loan premium related to the mortgage loan. We repaid both loans in advance of the maturity date without incurring prepayment fees.\nOn January 14, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement for a senior unsecured term loan facility (the $225 Million Term Loan Facility\u201d) that initially permits aggregate borrowings of up to $125 million, the total of which we borrowed the same day at closing. Under the terms of the $225 Million Term Loan Facility, we are permitted to add one or more incremental term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $100 million (the Accordion\u201d), subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions. On April 15, 2016, we exercised the Accordion in full, thereby increasing the aggregate amount outstanding under the $225 Million Term Loan Facility to $225 million. The maturity date of the $225 Million Term Loan Facility is January 14, 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we completed the sale of five of our properties for an aggregate gross sales price of $40.7 million. The net cash proceeds from these dispositions, which totaled $38.5 million, were used to acquire three properties in three separate 1031 Exchange transactions.\nThe following tables set forth our leasing activity for new and renewal leases on a quarterly basis for the year ended December 31, 2016:\nThe following table sets forth certain information with respect to our consolidated indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2016:\n \u2022 During 2016, we leased-up four of our value-add repositioning properties located at 2610 & 2701 Birch Street, 24105 Frampton Avenue, 12247 Lakeland Road and 15140 & 15148 Bledsoe Street. As of December 31, 2016, three of our repositioning properties are in the lease-up phase.  Dispositions\nOur Same Properties Portfolio property expenses increased by $1.2 million or 5.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in real estate tax expense and repairs and maintenance. The increase in real estate tax expense was due to supplemental assessments of certain of our properties resulting in lower real estate taxes during the year ended December 31, 2015, and a decrease in capitalized real estate taxes for properties under repositioning for comparable periods. Our Total Portfolio property expenses increased by $8.6 million, or 34.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the incremental expenses from the 41 properties we acquired during 2015 and 2016.\nAcquisition Expenses\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nThe gain from early repayment of note receivable of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, represents the recognition of the unamortized accretable yield related to the collection of the Calle Perfecto Note.\nOur Total Portfolio interest expense increased by $6.4 million, or 75.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to the following: (i) an increase in interest expense from the $225 million term loan facility which was fully drawn upon in April 2016, (ii) the issuance of $100 million of 4.29% fixed rate senior notes in August 2015 and subsequent repayment of two secured loans aggregating $91.3 million with a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.76% and (iii) the effect of four interest rate swaps, with an aggregate notional value of $160 million, that became effective between January 2015 and February 2016. These increases were partially offset by the following: (i) higher capitalized interest resulting from an increase in construction activity related to our repositioning properties and (ii) a decrease in interest expense from the reduced usage of our unsecured revolving credit facility during 2016.\nAs summarized in the table above, as of December 31, 2016, seven of our properties with a combined 0.8 million vacant rentable square feet, were currently in various stages of redevelopment, repositioning or lease-up. These seven properties are concentrated in our Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego markets, and represent 5.3% of our total consolidated portfolio square footage as of December 31, 2016. Including vacant repositioning space and lease-up space at these seven properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2016, in Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego was 92.1%, 96.1% and 81.0%, respectively. Excluding vacant repositioning space and lease-up space at these seven properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2016, in these markets was 97.9%, 96.7% and 97.3%, respectively, and our overall portfolio occupancy excluding these properties was 96.8%. We believe that a significant portion of our long-term future growth will come from the completion of these projects currently under or scheduled for repositioning, as well as through the identification or acquisition of new opportunities for redevelopment and repositioning, whether in our existing portfolio or through new investments, which may vary from period to period subject to market conditions.\nOn July 6, 2016, we acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from our unconsolidated joint venture (the JV\u201d). Prior to the acquisition, our ownership interest in the property was 15.0%. Equity in income from unconsolidated real estate entities includes our 15.0% equity interest in the operating results of the JV property prior to July 6, 2016, depreciation of basis adjustments related to the JV property and distributions received from the JV in connection with the sale of the property that exceeded the carrying value of our investment in the JV (the excess distributions\u201d). Our Total Portfolio equity in income from unconsolidated real estate entities increased by $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the excess distributions totaling $1.9 million that we received from the JV, partially offset by the write-off of the $0.6 million unamortized basis adjustment related to the JV property. For additional information, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Measure: EBITDA\nLoss on Sale of Real Estate\nDepreciation and Amortization\nInterest on the $225 Million Term Loan Facility accrues based upon, at our option, either (i) LIBOR plus the applicable Eurodollar rate margin or (ii) the applicable base rate which is the greater of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the administrative agent's prime rate or (c) the thirty-day LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus the applicable base rate margin. Until we obtain an investment grade rating by two or more of Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch Ratings, and elect to use the alternative rates based on our debt rating, the applicable Eurodollar rate margin will range from 1.50% to 2.25% per annum, and the applicable base rate margin will range from 0.50% to 1.25% per annum, depending on our Leverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement).\n \u2022 In February 2017, we entered into an agreement for a $450 million senior unsecured credit facility, comprised of a $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will mature in February 2021, with two six-month extensions available, and a $100 million unsecured term loan facility that will mature in February 2022. Borrowings under the $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin that will range from 1.10% to 1.50% per annum depending on our leverage ratio, and the $100 million unsecured term loan facility bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin that will range from 1.20% to 1.70% per annum depending on our leverage ratio. \n (5) The GAAP and cash re-leasing rent spreads for renewal leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2016, exclude 36 leases aggregating 252,872 rentable square feet for which there was no comparable lease data due to either (i) space with different lease structures or (ii) space with lease terms shorter than six months. \n \u2022 For the $225 Million Term Loan Facility, maintaining a minimum tangible net worth of at least the sum of (i) $283,622,250 and (ii) an amount equal to at least 75% of the net equity proceeds received by our company after March 31, 2014; \nScheduled Lease Expirations\nIncome From Discontinued Operations\n (7) The $200 million unsecured revolving credit facility is subject to an unused commitment fee, which is calculated as 0.30% or 0.20% of the daily-unused commitment if the balance is under $100 million or over $100 million, respectively. \nEquity in income (loss) from unconsolidated real estate entities includes our equity interests in the operating results of the properties held by our JV and basis adjustments related to these properties. In November 2014, the JV sold two of the three properties owned by the JV. Our Total Portfolio equity in income (loss) from unconsolidated real estate entities increased by $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the change in basis adjustments following the sale of these properties.\nThe following table sets forth the revenue and expense items comprising NOI and the adjustments to calculate Cash NOI (in thousands):\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors,\u201d Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Business\u201d and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n (6) On December 31, 2016, the full building lease held by Money Mailer Holding Corporation expired, and we subsequently began our repositioning of this building. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, we entered into a short-term lease with a tenant who will occupy approximately 100,000 rentable square feet during the construction period. This tenant is required to relocate within the building throughout construction so that we can complete our repositioning of the building. We have the right to terminate this short-term lease to coincide with the future leasing of the repositioned building. \n (6) As of December 31, 2016, $100 million term loan facility has been effectively fixed at 1.8975% plus the applicable LIBOR margin through the use of two interest rate swaps as follows: (i) $50 million with a strike rate of 1.79% with an effective date of August 14, 2015, and (ii) $50 million with a strike rate of 2.005% with an effective date of February 16, 2016. \nTaxable REIT Subsidiary\nUnsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility", "item_7_text": "Investment Grade Rating\nrepositioning property located at 1601 Alton Parkway, with a construction completion period estimated for the first quarter of 2017, and four additional current repositioning properties with estimated construction completion periods ranging from mid-2017 to mid-2018. We expect these properties to have positive impacts on our leasing activity and revenue generation as we complete our value-add repositioning plans and place these properties in service.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nTenant Reimbursements\nWe evaluate the capital markets on an ongoing basis for opportunities to raise capital, and as circumstances warrant, we may issue additional securities, from time to time, to fund acquisitions or repositioning costs, for the repayment of long-term debt\nA repositioning can consist of a range of improvements to a property. This may include a complete structural renovation of a property whereby we convert large underutilized spaces into a series of smaller and more functional spaces, or it may include the creation of additional square footage, the modernization of the property site, the elimination of functional obsolescence, the addition or enhancement of loading areas and truck access, the enhancement or fire-life-safety systems or other accretive improvements. Because each repositioning effort is unique and determined based on the property, targeted tenants and overall trends in the general market and specific submarket, the timing and effect of the repositioning on our rental revenue and occupancy levels will vary, and, as a result, will affect the comparison of our results of operations from period to period with limited predictability.\nThe recognition of gains on sales of real estate requires us to measure the timing of a sale against various criteria related to the terms of the transaction, as well as any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the property. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, profit-sharing or leasing method. If the sales criteria have been met, we further analyze whether profit recognition is appropriate using the full accrual method. If the criteria to recognize profit using the full accrual method have not been met, we defer the gain and recognize it when the criteria are met or use the installment or cost recovery method as appropriate under the circumstances.\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio rental revenue increased by $5.6 million, or 7.9%, and $26.5 million, or 32.6%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio is primarily due to the increase in our average occupancy for comparable periods and the increase in average rental rates on new and renewal leases. Our Total Portfolio rental revenue was also positively impacted by the revenues from the 41 properties we acquired during 2015 and 2016.\nManagement, Leasing and Development Services\nAs of December 31, 2016, 1.2 million rentable square feet of our portfolio was available for lease and leases representing 0.7 million rentable square feet of our portfolio expired on December 31, 2016, including a full building lease for 207,953 rentable square feet held by one of our top tenants (Money Mailer Holding Corporation located at 12131 Western Avenue) and a second full building lease for 108,703 rentable square feet located at 3880 Valley Boulevard. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, we began our repositioning of these two buildings.\nOur Same Properties Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $3.0 million, or 8.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to acquired lease related intangible and tangible assets for several of our properties becoming fully depreciated during 2016 and 2015, partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense related to capital improvements. Our Total Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense increased $9.6 million, or 22.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to incremental expense from the 41 properties we acquired during 2015 and 2016, and an increase in depreciation expense related to capital improvements, partially offset by the decrease in our Same Properties Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense noted above.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Measure: NOI and Cash NOI\nIn Orange County, rents continued their upward trend during 2016 and vacancy slightly declined year-over-year. We expect that the low availability of industrial product in this region, primarily due to re-zoning of available land to residential or mixed-use, will cause leasing rates to continue to grow through 2017.\n \u2022 In August 2016, we completed a public offering of 3,600,000 shares of our 5.875% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $86.7 million after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering costs. \n (1) Includes the effect of interest rate swaps that were effective as of December 31, 2016. Assumes a 1-month LIBOR rate of 0.7717% as of December 31, 2016, as applicable. Excludes the effect of amortization of deferred loan fees, discounts/premiums and the unused commitment fee on the $200 million unsecured revolving credit facility. \nNet cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $16.0 million to $40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to incremental cash flows from property acquisitions completed after January 1, 2014 and the increase in Cash NOI from our Same Properties Portfolio.\nEquity in Income (Loss) from Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities\nAssumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with respect to our investment that occur subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our real estate properties.\nProperties that are nonoperational as a result of repositioning or redevelopment activity may qualify for varying levels of interest, insurance and real estate tax capitalization during the development and construction period. An increase in our repositioning and development activities resulting from value-add acquisitions could cause an increase in the asset balances qualifying for interest, insurance and tax capitalization in future periods. We capitalized $1.7 million of interest expense and $0.8 million of insurance and real estate tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2016, related to our repositioning and redevelopment projects.\nGeneral and Administrative\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets Subsections of ASC Topic 360: Property, Plant, and Equipment, we assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets, including goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.\nNet operating income (NOI) includes the revenue and expense directly attributable to our real estate properties calculated in accordance with GAAP. NOI is calculated as total rental revenues from real estate operations including i) rental income, ii) tenant reimbursements, and iii) other income less property expenses (before interest expense, depreciation and amortization). We use NOI as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, gains (or losses) on sale of real estate and other non-operating items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that NOI will be useful to investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because NOI excludes depreciation and amortization expense and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties (all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations), the utility of NOI as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate NOI in a similar manner and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to such other REITs' NOI. Accordingly, NOI should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.\n (2) The total property rentable square feet in the table above reflects the square footage of the existing building that was acquired. Upon completion of the project, the property will be approximately 200,000 square feet, which reflects an increase in square footage from the construction of two additional buildings on the excess land. \nOn April 15, 2016, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, we consummated the transaction. We funded the purchase price and related transaction costs with available cash and the proceeds from the Accordion and the Equity Offering.\n \u2022 Maintaining a ratio of total unsecured debt to total unencumbered asset value of not more than 60%; \nCapital Recycling\n \u2022 Maintaining a ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value of not more than 60%; \nATM Program\nGain from Early Repayment of Note Receivable\nInterest Expense\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to NOI and Cash NOI (in thousands): \n \u2022 Maintaining a ratio of unencumbered NOI (as defined in the credit agreement) to unsecured interest expense of at least 1.75 to 1.0.  Additionally, the $225 Million Term Loan Facility and the Amended Credit Agreement contain limitations on our ability to pay distributions on our common stock. Specifically, our cash dividends may not exceed the greater of (1) 95% of our FFO (as\ndefined in the credit agreement) and (2) the amount required for us to qualify and maintain our REIT status. If an event of default exists, we may only make distributions sufficient to qualify and maintain our REIT status.\nAs of December 31, 2016, four of our properties were in various stages of repositioning and three of our properties were in the lease-up stage. In addition, we anticipate beginning repositioning work on five additional properties during 2017. The table below sets forth a summary of these properties, as well as the four repositioning properties that were completed and fully leased during 2016. In addition to the properties in the table below, we also have a range of smaller spaces in value-add repositioning or renovation, that due to their smaller size, are not presented below, however, in the aggregate, may be substantial.\nManagement uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, and asset impairments, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of performance used by other REITs, FFO may be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs.\nFor the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our Same Properties Portfolio includes all properties in our industrial portfolio that were wholly-owned by us as of January 1, 2015, and still owned by us as of December 31, 2016, which consisted of 95 properties aggregating approximately 9.5 million rentable square feet. Results for our Same Properties Portfolio exclude our joint venture property, any properties that were acquired or sold during 2016 and 2015, interest income from our note receivable, interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses. For the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our Total Portfolio includes the properties in our Same Properties Portfolio, the 41 properties aggregating approximately 5.5 million rentable square feet that were acquired during 2015 and 2016, and the five properties aggregating approximately 0.3 million rentable square feet that were sold during 2016.\nInterest on the Amended Credit Agreement, is generally to be paid based upon, at our option, either (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin that is based upon our leverage ratio or (ii) the Base Rate (which is defined as the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the administrative agent's prime rate or (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin that is based on our leverage ratio. The margins for the Amended Revolver range in amount from 1.10% to 1.50% for LIBOR-based loans and 0.10% to 0.50% for Base Rate-based loans, depending on our leverage ratio. The margins for the Amended Term Loan range in amount from 1.20% to 1.70% for LIBOR-based loans and 0.20% to 0.70% for Base Rate-based loans, depending on our leverage ratio.\nCapital expenditures are considered part of both our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $2.8 million of recurring capital expenditures, which was a decrease of $0.7 million over the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $21.2 million of non-recurring capital expenditures, which was an increase of $6.7 million over the prior year. The increase in non-recurring capital expenditures is primarily due to an increase in our redevelopment and repositioning activity and the growth of our overall portfolio. As discussed above under -Factors that May Influence Future Results -Acquisitions and Development of Properties, as of December 31, 2016, seven of our properties were in various stages of redevelopment and repositioning or lease-up, and we anticipate beginning repositioning work on five additional properties during 2017. We currently estimate that approximately $83.3 million of capital will be required over the next seven quarters (1Q-2017 through 3Q-2018) to complete the redevelopment and repositioning of these 12 properties. However, this estimate is based on our current construction plan and budgets, both of which are subject to change as a result of a number of factors. If we are unable to complete construction on schedule or within budget, we could incur increased construction costs and experience potential delays in leasing the properties. We expect to fund these projects through a combination of cash flow from operations, borrowings available under the Revolver, and recycling capital through property dispositions.\n\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through net cash flow from operations, proceeds from long-term secured and unsecured financings, borrowings available under our unsecured revolving credit facility, the issuance of equity securities, including preferred stock, and proceeds from selective real estate dispositions as we identify capital recycling opportunities.\nGain from Early Repayment of Note Receivable\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio other income increased by $0.3 million, or 112.8%, and $0.7 million, or 230.0%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in late fee income.\nupon maturity and for other general corporate purposes. Any future issuance, however, is dependent upon market conditions, available pricing and capital needs and there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such offerings of securities.\n \u2022 Maintaining a minimum Fair Market Net Worth (as defined in the term loan agreement) of at least $75 million, to be tested annually as of December 31 of each year.  We were in compliance with all of our quarterly and annual debt covenants as of December 31, 2016.\n \u2022 Maintaining a ratio of total secured recourse debt to total asset value of not more than 15%; \nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our Same Properties Portfolio occupancy was approximately 96.1% and 93.0%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our Same Properties Portfolio weighted average occupancy was approximately 93.4% and 90.7%, respectively.\nOur Total Portfolio acquisition expenses decreased by $0.3 million, or 13.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to lower brokerage fees related to acquisitions completed during the current year.\n (1) Amount represents our 15% share of unconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K. \n \u2022 In April 2016, we completed a public follow-on offering of 10,350,000 shares of our common stock, including the underwriters exercise in full of its option to purchase 1,350,000 shares of our common stock, at an offering price of $17.65 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $174.4 million after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering costs. \n (3) One additional one-year extension is available, if certain conditions are satisfied. \nThe gain from early repayment of note receivable of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, represents the recognition of the unamortized accretable yield related to the collection of the Calle Perfecto Note.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement is guaranteed by the Company and by substantially all of the current and to-be-formed subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership that own an unencumbered property. The Amended Credit Agreement is not secured by the Company's properties or by equity interests in the subsidiaries that hold such properties.\nRecurring and Nonrecurring Capital Expenditures\n (2) Reflects the estimated payments to counterparties assuming that the 1-month LIBOR rate is equal to 0.7717% from the effective date through the maturity date of each respective interest rate swap. \nIf we attain one additional investment grade rating by one or more of Standard & Poor's or Moody's Investor Services to complement our current investment grade Fitch rating, we may elect to convert the pricing structure under the Amended Credit Agreement to be based on such rating. In that event, the margins for the Amended Revolver will range in amount from 0.825% to 1.550% for LIBOR-based loans and 0.00% to 0.55% for Base Rate-based loans, depending on such rating. The margins for the Amended Term Loan will range in amount from 0.90% to 1.75% for LIBOR-based loans and 0.00% to 0.75% for Base Rate-based loans, depending on such ratings.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur Total Portfolio general and administrative expenses increased by $2.9 million, or 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due to the following: (i) a $0.8 million increase in employee-related costs due to increased staffing levels from growth, (ii) a $0.8 million increase in non-cash equity compensation expense primarily due to restricted stock grants made during 2014 and 2015, (iii) a $0.7 million increase in professional audit, SOX compliance and tax fees, and (iv) a $0.9 million increase in various overhead costs, including rent and other professional services fees. This increase was partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in legal fee expenses.\n (2) Calculated as the change between GAAP rents for new or renewal leases and the expiring GAAP rents on the expiring leases for the same space. \n (4) As of December 31, 2016, this term loan has been effectively fixed at 3.817% through the use of two interest rate swaps as follows: (i) $30 million at 3.726% with an effective date of January 15, 2015, and (ii) $29.7 million at 3.91% with an effective date of July 15, 2015. \nOther Income\nOn February 14, 2017, we amended our $300 million unsecured credit facility (the Prior Credit Facility\u201d) by entering into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides for a $450 million senior unsecured credit facility, comprised of a $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Amended Revolver\u201d) and a $100 million unsecured term loan facility (the \"Amended Term Loan\"). The Amended Revolver is scheduled to mature on February 12, 2021, and has two six-month extension options available for a maximum maturity date of February 14, 2022, subject to certain conditions and the payment of an additional fee. The Amended Term Loan is scheduled to mature on February 14, 2022. Under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, we may request additional lender commitments up to an additional aggregate $550 million, which may be comprised of additional revolving commitments under the Amended Revolver, an increase to the Amended Term Loan, additional term loan tranches or any combination of the foregoing.\nNet cash provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $315.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and consisted primarily of $174.4 million in net cash proceeds raised from the issuance of 10.35 million shares of common stock, $86.7 million in net cash proceeds raised from the issuance of 3.6 million shares of preferred stock and gross proceeds of $225.0 million from borrowings made under the $225 Million Term Loan Facility, partially offset by the repayment of $140.5 million of net borrowings outstanding under the Prior Revolver and the payment of $36.0 million in dividends and distributions. Net cash provided by financing activities was $192.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and consisted primarily of $176.2 million in net proceeds raised from the issuance of 11.5 million shares of common stock, proceeds of $100.0 million received from the issuance of the Notes and net borrowings of $48.0 million on the Prior Revolver, partially offset by the repayment of three secured loans aggregating $101.4 million, the payment of $27.1 million in dividends and distributions, and the payment of $0.8 million related to new borrowings.\n \u2022 Maintaining Unencumbered Liquid Assets (as defined in the term loan agreement) of not less than (i) $5 million, or (ii) $8 million if we elect to have Line of Credit Availability (as defined in the term loan agreement) included in the calculation, of which $2 million must be cash or cash equivalents, to be tested annually as of December 31 of each year; \nSources of Liquidity\nOur Total Portfolio interest income decreased by $0.3 million, or 35.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016, relates to a $6.0 million mortgage loan that we made on July 1, 2016, that is secured by an industrial property located in Rancho Cucamonga, California and that bears interest at 10.0% per annum. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015, relates to a mortgage note receivable that was repaid on August 21, 2015, ahead of its scheduled maturity. The mortgage note receivable was secured by an industrial property located at 32401-32803 Calle Perfecto (the Calle Perfecto Note\u201d) and bore interest at 6.001% per annum.\n \u2022 For the Amended Credit Agreement, maintaining a minimum tangible net worth of at least the sum of (i) $760,740,750 and (ii) an amount equal to at least 75% of the net equity proceeds received by the Company after September 30, 2016; \nIn addition to the interest payable on amounts outstanding under the Amended Revolver, we are required to pay an applicable facility fee, based upon our leverage ratio, on the aggregate amount of each lender's Revolving Credit Commitment (whether or not such Revolving Credit Commitment is drawn), as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement. The applicable facility fee will range in amount from 0.15% to 0.30%, depending on our leverage ratio. In the event that we convert the pricing structure to be based on an investment-grade rating, the applicable facility fee will range in amount from 0.125% to 0.30%, depending on such rating.\npremium or penalty. Amounts borrowed under the Amended Term Loan and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue increased $0.7 million, or 7.1%, and increased $6.2 million or 59.6%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio tenant reimbursements is primarily due to the lease-up of completed triple net repositioning properties during 2015 and supplemental assessments of certain of our properties resulting in lower reimbursable real estate taxes during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue was also impacted by the incremental reimbursements from the 41 properties we acquired during 2015 and 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our consolidated portfolio consisted of 136 properties with approximately 15.0 million rentable square feet. In addition, we currently manage an additional 19 properties with approximately 1.2 million rentable square feet.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement contains usual and customary events of default including defaults in the payment of principal, interest or fees, defaults in compliance with the covenants set forth in the Amended Credit Facility and other loan documentation, cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness, and bankruptcy and other insolvency defaults. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Amended Credit Facility, the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans, together with all accrued unpaid interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, may be declared immediately due and payable.\n (5) 9615 Norwalk has 10.26 acres of partially paved storage yard/industrial land that is currently under a month-to-month lease. We plan to construct a new building with approximately 200,000 rentable square feet after the month-to-month lease terminates. \nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases is affected by economic and competitive conditions in our markets and by the desirability of our individual properties, which may impact our results of operations.\nIn determining the fair value of intangible lease assets or liabilities, we also consider Level 3 inputs. Acquired above- and below-market leases are valued based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in-place rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases, if applicable. The estimated fair value of acquired in-place at-market tenant leases are the costs that would have been incurred to lease the property to the occupancy level of the property at the date of acquisition. Such estimates include the value associated with leasing commissions, legal and other costs, as well as the estimated period necessary to lease such property that would be incurred to lease the property to its occupancy level at the time of its acquisition. In determining the fair value for acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2016, we used an estimated average lease-up period ranging from six to twelve months. Acquisition costs associated with business combinations are expensed in the period they are incurred.\nOur Same Properties Portfolio property expenses decreased by $0.2 million or 1.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, and as a percentage of total rental revenues decreased to 27.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 28.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to a decrease in recoverable expenses including utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, and real estate tax expense resulting from supplemental assessments of certain of our properties, partially offset by an increase in non-recoverable overhead costs. Our Total Portfolio property expenses increased by $6.6 million, or 36.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the incremental expenses from the 57 properties we acquired during 2014 and 2015.\nInvestment in Real Estate\nRental Revenue\nDebt Covenants\n \u2022 Maintaining a ratio of adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) to fixed charges of at least 1.50 to 1.0; \nGeneral and Administrative\nCompany Overview\nMarket Fundamentals\nManagement, Leasing and Development Services\nOur Same Properties Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2.8 million, or 13.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to acquired lease related intangible and tangible assets for several of our properties becoming fully depreciated during 2015 and 2014. Our Total Portfolio depreciation and amortization expense increased $13.2 million, or 46.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the 57 properties we acquired during 2014 and 2015.\nRecoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. To review real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. The intent with regards to the underlying assets might change as market conditions and other factors change. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property, quoted market values and third party appraisals, where considered necessary. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan used to manage our underlying business. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we will recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our consolidated portfolio was 91.7% occupied. We believe the opportunity to increase occupancy at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth. An opportunity to drive this growth will derive from the lease-up of recently completed repositioning projects and the completion and lease-up of repositioning projects that are currently under construction and planned for near-term construction.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we repaid the $48.5 million term loan secured by eight of our properties and the mortgage loan encumbering the property located at 2980-2990 San Fernando Road. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million represents the write-off of $0.3 million of unamortized deferred loan costs related to the term loan, partially offset by the write-off of the $0.1 million unamortized loan premium related to the mortgage loan. We repaid both loans in advance of the maturity date without incurring prepayment fees.\nOur Total Portfolio management, leasing and development services revenue decreased by $0.1 million, or 19.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to our acquisition of the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from our unconsolidated joint venture in July 2016. Prior to this acquisition, we earned fees and commissions for providing property and construction management services for the property.\nIn Los Angeles County, we saw positive market trends in 2016, as record high occupancy levels continued year-over-year, and asking lease rates increased at a stable pace during 2016. We expect that rents will continue to improve through 2017, as occupancy is at near capacity levels and new development is limited by a lack of land availability and an increase in land and development costs.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in net cash flows associated with our operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nThe loss on sale of real estate of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, relates to the disposition of our property located at 500-560 Zenith Drive, in Glenview, Illinois ( Zenith Drive\u201d). We adopted ASU 2014-08: Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity ( ASU 2014-08\u201d), beginning with the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2014. Under ASU 2014-08, only disposals that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the entity's results and operations would qualify as discontinued operations. The disposal of Zenith Drive did not meet the criteria to be classified in discontinued operations, and as such, the loss on sale of real estate is included in continuing operations.\n \u2022 In January 2016, we closed on a seven-year $125 million unsecured term loan facility that will mature in January 2023. The term loan facility bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable Eurodollar rate margin that will range from 1.50% to 2.25% per annum depending on our leverage ratio. \nInterest Income\nFor the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our Same Properties Portfolio includes all properties in our industrial portfolio that were wholly-owned by us as of January 1, 2014, and still owned by us as of December 31, 2015, which consisted of 62 properties aggregating approximately 6.1 million rentable square feet. Results for our Same Properties Portfolio exclude our JV properties, any properties that were acquired or sold during 2015 or 2014, interest income from our note receivable, and corporate general and administrative expenses. For the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our Total Portfolio includes the properties in our Same Properties Portfolio, the 57 properties aggregating approximately 5.9 million rentable square feet that were acquired during 2015 and 2014, and the three properties aggregating approximately 0.2 million rentable square feet that were sold during 2014.\nAcquisitions\nInterest Income\nNet cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $15.9 million to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to incremental cash flows from property acquisitions completed after January 1, 2015, and the increase in Cash NOI from our Same Properties Portfolio, partially offset by higher cash interest paid for comparable periods.\nThe Amended Revolver and the Amended Term Loan may be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part at any time without\nWe allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of a property by valuing the property as if it were vacant. This as-if vacant\u201d value is estimated using an income, or discounted cash flow approach that relies upon Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs based on our assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use. These Level 3 inputs include discount rates, capitalization rates, market rents and comparable sales data for similar properties. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. In calculating the as-if-vacant\u201d value for acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2016, we used discount rates ranging from 6.00% and 8.50% and capitalization rates ranging from 5.25% to 7.50%.\nLeases representing 16.3% and 12.6% of the aggregate rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we renewed 283 leases, or 58.6% of the number of leases scheduled to expire, which represented 64.2% of the aggregate rentable square footage under all expiring leases. Our retention rate during the year was impacted by our strategy to roll certain tenants at recessionary rents and to replace them with higher quality tenants paying higher rents. New and renewal leases signed during the current year had a weighted average term of 4.3 and 3.5 years, respectively, and we expect future new and renewal leases to have similar terms.\nOur operating results depend upon the infill Southern California industrial real estate market.\nOn April 15, 2016, we completed a public follow-on offering (the Equity Offering\u201d) of 10,350,000 shares of our common stock, including the underwriters exercise in full of its option to purchase an additional 1,350,000 shares of our common stock, at an offering price of $17.65 per share. The net proceeds were approximately $174.4 million, after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering costs totaling $8.3 million. A portion of the net proceeds from the Equity Offering were used to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, which had an outstanding balance of $62.5 million on April 15, 2016, the date of repayment, and to partially fund the REIT Portfolio Acquisition as discussed below under -Uses of Liquidity- REIT Portfolio Acquisition.\n (4) The GAAP and cash re-leasing spreads for new leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2016, exclude 82 leases aggregating 1,057,003 rentable square feet for which space was vacant when the property was acquired or there was no comparable lease data. Comparable leases generally exclude: (i) space that has never been occupied under our ownership, (ii) recently repositioned/redeveloped space, (iii) space that has been vacant for over one year, (iv) space with different lease structures (for example a change from a gross lease to a modified gross lease or an increase or decrease in the leased square footage) or (v) space with lease terms shorter than six months. \nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $124.4 million to $361.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $236.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to the $139.1 million increase in cash paid for property acquisitions and the $9.7 million increase in cash paid for construction and repositioning projects for comparable periods, partially offset by aggregate net proceeds of $38.5 million received from five real estate dispositions completed during 2016.\n (2) Excludes unamortized deferred loan fees and net debt premiums aggregating $2.3 million as of December 31, 2016. \nConsolidated Indebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nWe recognize revenue from rent, tenant reimbursements and other revenue sources once all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, the delivery has occurred or services rendered, the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Minimum annual rental revenues are recognized in rental revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession or controls the physical use of the leased space.\nIn San Diego, the market fundamentals continued to be strong during 2016, as asking lease rates increased to a record high and overall vacancy in the market decreased to an all-time low.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements revenue decreased $0.1 million, or 2.1%, and increased $2.8 million or 36.8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in our Same Properties Portfolio tenant reimbursements is directly related to the decrease in real estate taxes resulting from supplemental assessments of certain of our properties, as described below under property expenses, as well as lower reimbursements resulting from the completion of prior year recoverable expense reconciliations for comparable periods. Our Total Portfolio tenant reimbursements primarily increased due to the incremental reimbursements from the 57 properties we acquired during 2014 and 2015.\nIncome from discontinued operations of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, is comprised primarily of the gain on sale of our property located at 1335 Park Center Drive, partially offset by the loss on sale of our property located at 2900 N. Madera Road.\nOur Same Properties Portfolio interest expense decreased by $0.5 million, or 48.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the repayment of the outstanding mortgages encumbering the Glendale Commerce Center during August 2015 and the property located at 10700 Jersey Boulevard during October 2014. Our Total Portfolio interest expense increased by $2.1 million, or 32.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily due to the increase in our weighted average interest rate resulting from the issuance of $100 million of 4.29% fixed rate senior notes in August 2015 and the three interest rate swaps that were in effect during the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as the increase in our average outstanding debt balances. The increase was partially offset by the mortgage repayments noted above and an increase in capitalized interest due to increased construction activity on our repositioning properties during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe believe that earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of our operating performance as a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of our industrial properties. We also use this measure in ratios to compare our performance to that of our industry peers. However, our industry peers may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner as we do and, accordingly, our EBITDA may not be comparable to our peers' EBITDA. Accordingly, EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of our performance.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $15.5 million, and we did not have any amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility, leaving $200.0 million available for additional borrowings.\n (7) The property located at 18118-18120 S. Broadway includes three buildings. We plan to reposition one building with 18,033 rentable square feet when the current tenant vacates in 1Q-2017. \nAs of December 31, 2016, our Operating Partnership indirectly and wholly owns Rexford Industrial Realty and Management, Inc., which we refer to as the services company. We have elected, together with our services company, to treat our services company as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary generally may provide non-customary and other services to our tenants and engage in activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a REIT, provided a taxable REIT subsidiary may not operate or manage a lodging facility or health care facility or provide rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated. We may form additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future, and our Operating Partnership may contribute some or all of its interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries or their assets to our services company. Any income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not be included in our taxable income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, except to the extent such income is distributed to us as a dividend, in which case such dividend income will qualify under the 95%, but not the 75%, gross income test. Because a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax, and state and local income tax (where applicable) as a\n (4) During the year ended December 31, 2016, we completed construction and leased-up three units totaling 60,667 rentable square feet. We expect to complete construction and lease-up the remaining 14,000 rentable square foot unit during 1Q-2017. \nThe following table summarizes the composition of our consolidated debt between fixed-rate and variable-rate and secured and unsecured debt as of December 31, 2016:\n \u2022 In February 2016, we executed a forward interest swap that will effectively fix the $125 million unsecured term loan facility at 1.349% plus an applicable margin from February 14, 2018, to January 14, 2022. \nThe majority of our leases are either triple net or provide for tenant reimbursement for costs related to real estate taxes and operating expenses. In addition, most of the leases provide for fixed rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases to real estate taxes, utility expenses and other operating expenses may be partially offset by the contractual rent increases and tenant payment of taxes and expenses described above. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nOur Total Portfolio general and administrative expenses increased by $2.4 million, or 16.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to the following: (i) a $2.0 million increase in non-cash equity compensation expense primarily due to equity grants made in December 2015, (ii) a $0.9 million increase in bonus expense due to Company performance, (iii) a $0.7 million increase in payroll and employment related costs primarily due to an increase in headcount, (iv) a $0.4 million increase in other various corporate expenses and (v) a $0.4 million increase in professional service and consulting fees. These increases were partially offset by the following: (i) a $1.6 million decrease in legal fees, which includes a $1.0 million insurance reimbursement of legal fees related to prior litigation received during the year ended December 31, 2016, and (ii) a $0.5 million decrease in professional audit, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance and tax fees.\nThe occupancy rate of properties not undergoing repositioning is affected by regional and local economic conditions in our Southern California infill markets. Throughout 2016, the Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego county markets have continued to show historically low vacancy and positive absorption, resulting from high tenant demand combined with low product availability. Accordingly, our properties in these markets have exhibited a similar trend. We expect general market conditions to remain positive in 2017, and we believe the opportunity to increase occupancy and rental rates at our properties will be an important driver of future revenue growth.\nREIT Portfolio Acquisition\nOur goal is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders by providing superior access to industrial property investments and mortgage debt secured by industrial property in Southern California infill markets. Our target markets provide us with opportunities to acquire both stabilized properties generating favorable cash flow, as well as properties where we can enhance returns through value-add renovations and redevelopment. Scarcity of available space and high barriers limiting new construction of for-lease product all contribute to create superior long-term supply/demand fundamentals within our target infill Southern California industrial property markets. With our vertically integrated platform and extensive value-add investment and management capabilities, we believe we are in a position to capitalize upon the opportunities in our markets to achieve our objectives.\nWe anticipate continuing to selectively dispose of properties, however, the timing of any potential future dispositions will depend on market conditions and our capital needs. Our ability to dispose of selective properties on advantageous terms, or at all, is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable.\n (1) Based on the 1-month LIBOR rate of 0.7717%, as of December 31, 2016. \n\nCash Flow from Operations\n (3) Calculated as the change between cash rents for new or renewal leases and the expiring cash rents on the expiring leases for the same space. \nour cash flow on a quarterly basis to holders of our common stock. In addition, we intend to make distribution payments to holders of OP Units and dividend payments to holders of our preferred stock.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nIn order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. To satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT and generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, we intend to distribute a percentage of\nAcquisitions and Development of Properties\n \u2022 During 2016, we completed the sale of five of our properties with a combined 310,871 rentable square feet, for a total gross sales price of $40.7 million. The net cash proceeds, which totaled $38.5 million, were reinvested as part of three separate 1031 Exchange transactions.  Equity\n (1) Effective rent per square foot is the average base rent calculated in accordance with GAAP, over the term of the lease, expressed in dollars per square foot per year. Includes all new and renewal leases executed during each respective quarter. \nEstimated reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period that the recoverable expenses are incurred. Subsequent to year-end, we perform final reconciliations on a lease-by-lease basis and bill or credit each tenant for any cumulative annual adjustments. Lease\nCash flow from operations is one of our key sources of liquidity and is primarily dependent upon: (i) the occupancy levels and lease rates at our properties, (ii) our ability to collect rent, (iii) the level of operating costs we incur and (iv) our ability to pass through operating expenses to our tenants. We are subject to a number of risks related to general economic and other unpredictable conditions, which have the potential to affect our overall performance and resulting cash flows from operations. However, based on our current portfolio mix and business strategy, we anticipate that we will be able to generate positive cash flows from operations.\n\nOur consolidated results of operations are often not comparable from period to period due to the effect of property acquisitions and dispositions completed during the comparative reporting periods. Our Total Portfolio\u201d represents all of the properties owned during the reported periods. To eliminate the effect of changes in our Total Portfolio due to acquisitions and dispositions and to highlight the operating results of our on-going business, we have separately presented the results of our Same Properties Portfolio.\u201d\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe difference between the fair value and the face value of debt assumed in connection with an acquisition is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized to interest expense\u201d over the life of the debt assumed. The valuation of assumed liabilities is based on our estimate of the current market rates for similar liabilities in effect at the acquisition date.\nTenant Reimbursements\n (3) Includes total commitments for tenant improvement and construction work related to obligations under certain tenant leases and vendor contracts. We anticipate these obligations to be paid as incurred in 2017 and 2018, however, as the timing of these obligations is subject to a number of factors, for purposes of this table, we have included the full amount under 2017.\u201d  Dividends and Distributions\nWe continuously evaluate opportunities for the potential disposition of properties in our portfolio when we believe such disposition is appropriate in view of our business objectives. In evaluating these opportunities, we consider a variety of criteria including, but not limited to, local market conditions and lease rates, asset type and location, as well as potential uses of proceeds and tax considerations. Tax considerations include entering into tax-deferred like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code ( 1031 Exchange\u201d), when possible, to defer some or all of the taxable gains, if any, on dispositions.\nThe following table sets forth our principal obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016, including (i) scheduled principal payments and debt maturities, (ii) periodic interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness and interest rate swaps, (iii) office and ground lease payments and (iv) other contractual obligations (in thousands):\nDepreciation and Amortization\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\n (3) Noncontrolling interest represent holders of outstanding common units of our Operating Partnership that are owned by unit holders other than Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a total gain of $17.4 million from the disposition of five properties that were sold for an aggregate gross sales price of $40.7 million.\nThe Notes contain a series of financial and other covenants with which we must comply. The financial covenants, which are tested on a quarterly basis, are the same as those that we must comply with under the $225 Million Term Loan Facility, as detailed above. Subject to the terms of the Notes, upon certain events of default, including, but not limited to, (i) a default in the payment of any principal, make-whole payment amount, or interest under the Notes, (ii) a default in the payment of certain of our other indebtedness, (iii) a default in compliance with the covenants set forth in the Notes agreement and (iv) bankruptcy and other insolvency defaults, the principal and accrued and unpaid interest and the make-whole payment amount on the outstanding Notes will become due and payable at the option of the purchasers.\n\nOur Total Portfolio management, leasing and development services revenue decreased by $0.3 million, or 32.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily due to lower management fees from the JV as a result of the sale of two of the three buildings owned by the JV in November 2014.\n \u2022 Maintaining a Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the term loan agreement) of at least 1.10 to 1.00, to be tested quarterly; \nValuation of Receivables\nWhen we acquire operating properties with the intention to hold the investment for the long-term, and such acquisitions meet the accounting criteria to be accounted for as business combinations, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The components typically include land, building and improvements, tenant improvements, intangible assets related to above and below market leases, intangible assets related to in-place leases, debt and other assumed assets and liabilities. Because of the timing or complexity of completing certain fair value adjustments, the initial purchase price allocation may be incomplete at the end of a reporting period, in which case we may record provisional purchase price allocation amounts based on information available at the acquisition date. Subsequent adjustments to provisional amounts are recognized during the measurement period, which cannot exceed one year from the date of acquisition.\n (1) Amount represents our 15% share of unconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K. \n\n (1) The estimated construction completion period is subject to change as a result of a number of factors including but not limited to permit requirements, delays in construction, changes in scope, and other unforeseen circumstances. \n\n \u2022 In May 2016, we executed a forward interest swap that will effectively fix the incremental $100 million term loan at 1.406% plus an applicable margin from August 14, 2018, to January 14, 2022. \n\nEquity Offerings\nOther Income\n$225 Million Term Loan Facility\nProperty Expenses\nInflation\nDuring 2015, we obtained investment grade ratings of BBB- from Fitch Ratings on our Prior Credit Facility and $100 million guaranteed senior notes (the Notes\u201d). In April 2016, we also obtained the same rating on our $225 Million Term Loan Facility. These were most recently affirmed in August 2016, with a stable outlook. In August 2016, we also obtained an investment grade rating of BB from Fitch Ratings on the Series A Preferred Stock. Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. In the event our current credit ratings are downgraded, it may become difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing indebtedness as maturities become due.\nOur leasing activity is impacted both by our redevelopment and repositioning efforts, as well as by market conditions. While we reposition a property, its space may become unavailable for leasing until completion of our repositioning efforts. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we completed repositioning at five of our properties located at 9401 De Soto Avenue, 679-691 S. Anderson Street, 24105 Frampton Avenue, 12247 Lakeland Road and 15140 & 15148 Bledsoe Street, and at the end of 2015, we completed repositioning at our property located at 2610 & 2701 S. Birch Street. As of December 31, 2016, our properties located at 9401 De Soto Avenue and 679-691 S. Anderson Street were in the lease-up stage. We also have one\nResults of Operations\nOn April 11, 2016, we entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d) to acquire a private real estate investment trust that owns a portfolio of nine industrial properties totaling approximately 1.53 million rentable square feet, from a third-party seller in exchange for approximately $191.0 million in cash, exclusive of closing costs (the REIT Portfolio Acquisition\u201d).\nOur rental expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, site repair and maintenance costs, and the allocation of overhead costs. For the majority of our properties, our property expenses are recovered, in part, by either the triple net provisions or modified gross expense reimbursements in tenant leases. The majority of our leases also comprise contractual three percent annual rental rate increases meant, in part, to help mitigate potential increases in property expenses over time. However, the terms of our leases vary and in some instances we may absorb property expenses. Our overall financial results will be impacted by the extent to which we are able to pass-through property expenses to our tenants.\n \u2022 During December 2016, we sold a total of 571,368 shares of our common stock under our ATM Program, of which 168,685 shares were settled in January 2017, for gross proceeds of $13.2 million, or approximately $23.14 per share, and net proceeds of approximately $13.0 million after deducting the sales agents' fee.  Financing\nAs of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we had borrowings of $115 million outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement, including $15 million drawn on the Amended Revolver and $100 million under the Amended Term Loan.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nAt December 31, 2016, we had total indebtedness of approximately $502.5 million, reflecting a net debt to total combined market capitalization of approximately 22.6%. Our total combined market capitalization is defined as the sum of the liquidation value of our preferred stock plus the market value of our common stock excluding shares of nonvested restricted stock, plus the aggregate value of common units not owned by us, plus the value of our net debt. Our net debt is defined as our consolidated indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents.\nHighlights\nFor acquisitions that do not meet the accounting criteria to be accounted for as a business combination, we allocate the cost of the acquisition, which includes any associated acquisition costs, to the individual assets (typically land and building) and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. We capitalized total acquisition costs of $0.2 million, $0.7 million and $0.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGain on Sale of Real Estate\nNOI on a cash-basis (Cash NOI) is a non-GAAP measure, which we calculate by adding or subtracting from NOI (i) fair value lease revenue and (ii) straight-line rent adjustments. We use Cash NOI, together with NOI, as a supplemental performance measure. Cash NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. Cash NOI should not be used as a substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\n\nLeasing Activity and Rental Rates\nThe leases scheduled to expire during the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2018, represent 17.8% and 14.5%, respectively, of the total annualized base rent for our portfolio as of December 31, 2016. We estimate that, on a weighted average basis, in-place rents of leases scheduled to expire in 2017 and 2018 are currently below current market asking rents, although individual units or properties within any particular submarket presently may be leased either above, below, or at the current market asking rates within that submarket. Over the last few years, rental rates for comparable product in our submarkets have generally been rising. This positive trend offers a favorable environment for additional increases in lease renewal rates. Accordingly, we expect 2017 will show positive renewal rates and leasing spreads. We also currently do not see any reason not to expect that 2018 lease expirations will show positive growth upon renewal; however, it is difficult to predict market conditions that far into the future.\nWe capitalized interest costs of $1.7 million, $0.8 million and $42 thousand during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We capitalized real estate taxes and insurance aggregating $0.8 million, $0.8 million and $0.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We capitalized compensation costs for employees who provide construction services of $1.0 million, $0.9 million and $0.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe calculate funds from operations ( FFO\u201d) attributable to common stockholders in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures.\nroll-over or that provide opportunities to add-value through functional or physical repositioning and improvements. Through various redevelopment, repositioning, and professional leasing and marketing strategies, we seek to increase the properties' functionality and attractiveness to prospective tenants and, over time, to stabilize the properties at occupancy and lease rates that meet or exceed market rates.\nOn August 16, 2016, we completed a public offering of 3,600,000 shares of our 5.875% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the Series A Preferred Stock\u201d) at a price of $25.00 per share. The net proceeds from the preferred offering were approximately $86.7 million, after deducting the underwriters' discount and offering costs totaling $3.3 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering to fund various acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio other income decreased by $0.3 million, or 32.6%, and $0.1 million, or 6.9%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in our Same Properties Portfolio other income is primarily due to a decrease in filming income at one of our properties and a decrease in late fee income and other miscellaneous tenant income. The decrease in our Total Portfolio income is primarily due to a decrease in miscellaneous tenant income.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to FFO (in thousands):\n (2) Excludes unamortized deferred loan fees and net debt premiums aggregating $2.3 million as of December 31, 2016.  As of December 31, 2016, we had total indebtedness, excluding unamortized deferred loan fees and net debt premiums, of $502.5 million, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.29% and an average term-to-maturity of 5.3 years. As of December 31, 2016, $277.5 million, or 55%, of our outstanding indebtedness had an interest rate that was effectively fixed under either the terms of the loan ($117.8 million) or an interest rate swap ($159.7 million). We have two interest rate swaps that will effectively fix the interest on the $225 Million Term Loan Facility as follows: (i) $125 million at 1.349% plus the applicable LIBOR margin from February 14, 2018, to January 14, 2022, and (ii) $100 million at 1.406% plus the applicable LIBOR margin from August 14, 2018, to January 14, 2022. If these two interest rate swaps were effective as of December 31, 2016, our consolidated debt would be 100% fixed-rate and 0% variable-rate.\n (1) Includes the effect of interest rate swaps that were effective as of December 31, 2016. Excludes the effect of amortization of deferred loan fees, discounts/premiums and the unused commitment fee on the $200 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Assumes a 1-month LIBOR rate of 0.7717% as of December 31, 2016, as applicable. \nInterest Expense\n (2) For the year ended December 31, 2016, the gain relates to the Company's acquisition of the remaining 85% ownership interest in the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from the JV. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K. \nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nRevenues from management, leasing and development services are recognized when the related services have been provided and earned.\n\nWe capitalize direct costs incurred in developing, renovating, rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis. This includes certain general and administrative costs, including payroll, bonus, and non-cash equity compensation of the personnel performing development, renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are identifiable to a specific activity to get the real estate asset ready for its intended use. During the development and construction periods of a project, we also capitalize interest, real estate taxes and insurance costs. We cease capitalization of costs upon substantial completion of the project, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. If some portions of a project are substantially complete and ready for use and other portions have not yet reached that stage, we cease capitalizing costs on the completed portion of the project but continue to capitalize for the incomplete portion of the project. Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe following table summarizes the cash flows of Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nOn February 14, 2017, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.145 per share of common stock and a quarterly cash distribution of $0.145 per OP Unit, to be paid on April 17, 2017, to holders of record as of March 31, 2017. Also on February 14, 2017, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36719 per share of the Series A Preferred Stock, to be paid on March 31, 2017, to preferred stockholders of record as of March 15, 2017.\nRental Revenue\nOccupancy Rates\nThe following critical accounting policies discussion reflects what we believe are the most significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this report on Form 10-K.\nOur $60 million amortizing term loan contains the following financial covenants:\nCash Flows\nOur Same Properties Portfolio and Total Portfolio rental revenue increased by $2.1 million, or 4.6%, and $24.5 million, or 43.2%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in our Same Properties Portfolio is primarily due to the increase in our average occupancy for comparable periods and the increase in average rental rates on new and renewal leases. Our Total Portfolio rental revenue was also positively impacted by the revenues from the 57 properties we acquired during 2014 and 2015.\nAcquisitions\nLastly, in the Inland Empire, new industrial product continues to be absorbed well in the market. In the Inland Empire West, which contains infill markets in which we operate, vacancy remained low and asking lease rates increased significantly year-over-year. We expect the outlook for the Inland Empire West to remain positive over the upcoming year. We generally do not focus on properties located within the non-infill Inland Empire East sub-market.\nThe infill Southern California industrial real estate sector has continued to exhibit strong fundamentals. Available industrial supply continues to decrease in many of our target infill submarkets, landlord concessions are reducing and construction deliveries are falling short of demand. Meanwhile, underlying tenant demand within our infill markets continues to demonstrate growth, illustrated or driven by strong re-leasing spreads, an expanding regional population, substantial growth in e-commerce transaction and delivery volumes as well as further compression of delivery time-frames. Even with concerns about global growth, potential changes to trade and tariff policies and the threat of rising interest rates, we are seeing a number of positive trends in some of our key markets that we expect will continue into the upcoming year.\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Measure: Funds From Operations\nA critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity's financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management. Generally, the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by the users of our financial statements in their evaluation of our performance.\n (4) Participating securities include unvested shares of restricted stock, unvested LTIP units of partnership interest in our Operating Partnership and unvested performance units in our Operating Partnership. \nOn April 17, 2015, we established the ATM Program pursuant to which we may issue and sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $125.0 million of our common stock through sales agents. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have sold 571,868 shares of common stock under the ATM Program for aggregate gross proceeds of $13.2 million, leaving us with the capacity to issue up to $111.8 million of additional shares. Future sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, determinations by us of the appropriate sources of funding for us and potential uses of funding available to us. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of shares under the ATM Program, if any, to fund potential acquisition opportunities, repay amounts outstanding from time to time under our unsecured revolving credit facility or other debt financing obligations, to fund our development or redevelopment activities and/or for general corporate purposes.\nOur Total Portfolio interest income decreased by $0.4 million, or 36.4%, during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. On August 21, 2015, the borrower of the Calle Perfecto Note repaid the outstanding principal balance ahead of its schedule maturity. The decrease in interest income is a result of this early repayment.\nIn Ventura County, there was a slight increase in vacancy and a slight decrease in asking lease rates year-over-year.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $143.8 million to $236.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $380.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $153.1 million decrease in cash paid for property acquisitions for comparable periods, partially offset by the increase in cash paid for construction and repositioning projects of $8.2 million for comparable periods.\n\nThe $225 Million Term Loan Facility and the Amended Credit Agreement both include a series of financial and other covenants that we must comply with, including the following covenants which are tested on a quarterly basis:\nRexford Industrial Realty, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed full-service REIT focused on owning and operating industrial properties in Southern California infill markets. We were formed as a Maryland corporation on January 18, 2013 and Rexford Industrial Realty, L.P. (the Operating Partnership\u201d), of which we are the sole general partner, was formed as a Maryland limited partnership on January 18, 2013. Through our controlling interest in our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, we own, manage, lease, acquire and develop industrial real estate primarily located in Southern California infill markets, and from time to time, acquire or provide mortgage debt secured by industrial property. We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under the Code, and generally are not subject to federal taxes on our income to the extent we distribute our income to our shareholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT.\n \u2022 Maintaining a ratio of secured debt to total asset value of not more than 45%; \n\ntermination fees, which are included in rental revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, are recognized when the related lease is canceled and we have no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenant.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our Same Properties Portfolio occupancy was approximately 94.4% and 92.8%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our Same Properties Portfolio weighted average occupancy was approximately 93.2% and 91.0%, respectively.\nOur operating results depend primarily upon generating rental revenue from the properties in our consolidated portfolio. The amount of rental revenue generated by these properties is affected by our ability to maintain or increase occupancy levels and rental rates at our properties, which will depend upon our ability to lease vacant space and re-lease expiring space at favorable rates.\nThe properties in our portfolio are located primarily in Southern California infill markets. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in this market may affect our overall performance.\nNet cash provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $192.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and consisted primarily of net proceeds of $176.2 million from the issuance of 11.5 million shares of common stock (including the underwriters exercise in full of its option to purchase an additional 1,500,000 shares of our common stock), $100 million proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and net borrowings of $48.0 million on the Prior Revolver, partially offset by the repayment of three secured loans aggregating $101.4 million, the payment of $27.1 million in dividends and distributions, and the payment of $0.8 million of deferred loan costs related to new borrowings. Net cash provided by financing activities was $355.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and consisted primarily of net proceeds of $221.8 million from the issuance of 17.25 million shares of common stock, the receipt of $148.5 million from two term loan borrowings, and net borrowings of $11.1 million on our Prior Revolver, partially offset by the payment of $18.4 million in dividends and distributions, the repayment of the $5.0 million note secured by one of our properties and the payment of $1.9 million of deferred loan costs related to new borrowings.\n (5) The applicable LIBOR margin will range from 1.25% to 1.85% for the $100 million term loan facility, 1.30% to 1.90% for the $200 million unsecured revolving credit facility and 1.50% to 2.25% for the $225 Million Term Loan Facility, depending on the ratio of our outstanding consolidated indebtedness to the value of our consolidated gross asset value. This ratio is measured on a quarterly basis, and as a result, the effective interest rate will fluctuate from period to period. \nProperty Expenses\nAcquisition Expenses\n (3) The property located at 228th Street includes eight buildings, of which three buildings aggregating 23,749 rentable square feet were under repositioning as of December 31, 2016. \n\nOur Total Portfolio acquisition expenses increased by $0.1 million, or 4.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased brokerage fees related to acquisitions completed during the current year.\nWe are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables. In order to mitigate these risks, we perform credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed and on existing tenants before properties are acquired. We specifically analyze aged receivables, customer credit-worthiness, historical bad debts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. As a result of our periodic analysis, we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments. This estimate requires significant judgment related to the lessees' ability to fulfill their obligations under the leases. We believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate for our outstanding receivables for the periods presented. If a tenant is insolvent or files for bankruptcy protection and fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the net outstanding balances, which include amounts recognized as straight-line revenue not realizable until future periods.\nConditions in Our Markets\nAcquisitions\nCapitalization of Costs\nA key component of our growth strategy is to acquire properties through off-market and lightly marketed transactions that are often operating at below-market occupancy or below-market rent at the time of acquisition or that have near-term lease\nOne of our most significant liquidity needs has historically been for the acquisition of real estate properties. As part of our growth strategy, we are actively monitoring a volume of properties in our markets that we believe represent attractive potential investment opportunities. While the actual number of acquisitions that we complete will be dependent upon a number of factors, in the short term, we expect to fund our acquisitions through available cash on hand, cash flows from operations, borrowings available under the Amended Revolver, recycling capital through property dispositions and, in the long term, through the issuance of equity securities or proceeds from long-term secured and unsecured financings. On February 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of a single-tenant industrial property for a contract price of $17.1 million. The acquisition was funded using available cash on hand and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nWe have the option to voluntarily prepay any amounts borrowed under the $225 Million Term Loan Facility in whole or in part at any time, subject to certain notice requirements. To the extent that we prepay all or any portion of a loan on or prior to January 14, 2018, we will pay a prepayment premium equal to (i) if such prepayment occurs prior to January 14, 2017, 2.00% of the principal amount so prepaid and (ii) if such prepayment occurs on or after January 14, 2017, but prior to January 14, 2018, 1.00% of the principal amount so prepaid. Amounts borrowed under the $225 Million Term Loan Facility and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We have summarized below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on financial condition and results of operations. Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions that it believes are reasonable as of the date hereof. In addition, other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those of other companies.\nregular corporation, the income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally will be subject to an additional level of tax as compared to the income earned by our other subsidiaries. Our taxable REIT subsidiary is a C-corporation subject to federal and state income tax, however it has a cumulative unrecognized net operation loss carryforward and therefore there is no income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nProperty Expenses\n (8) As of December 31, 2016, we have executed two interest rate swaps that will effectively fix the interest on the $225 Million Term Loan Facility as follows: (i) $125 million at 1.349% plus the applicable LIBOR margin from February 14, 2018, to January 14, 2022, and (ii) $100 million at 1.406% plus the applicable LIBOR margin from August 14, 2018, to January 14, 2022. \nUses of Liquidity\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to EBITDA (in thousands):\n (8) We plan to reposition 107,965 rentable square feet of warehouse space at this property when the current tenant vacates in 2Q-2017. \nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\n \u2022 In April 2016, we exercised the accordion that was available to us under the $125 million unsecured term loan facility and established a new incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $100 million. \nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for operating expenses, interest expense, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, and distributions to our common and preferred stockholders and holders of common units of partnership interests in our Operating Partnership ( OP Units\u201d). We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through available cash on hand, cash flow from operations, by drawing on our unsecured revolving credit facility and by issuing shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Program described below.\nEquity in Income from Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities\n \u2022 During 2016, we acquired 20 properties, aggregating 3.4 million square feet, for an aggregate cost of $371.7 million, of which four properties aggregating 0.8 million square feet were considered value-add acquisitions.  Repositioning\nCritical Accounting Policies\nHowever, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other equity REITs may not calculate or interpret FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nRental Revenue\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we repaid the $48.5 million term loan secured by eight of our properties and the mortgage loan encumbering the property located at 2980-2990 San Fernando Road. The loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million represents the write-off of $0.3 million of unamortized deferred loan costs related to the term loan, partially offset by the write-off of the $0.1 million unamortized loan premium related to the mortgage loan. We repaid both loans in advance of the maturity date without incurring prepayment fees.\nOn January 14, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement for a senior unsecured term loan facility (the $225 Million Term Loan Facility\u201d) that initially permits aggregate borrowings of up to $125 million, the total of which we borrowed the same day at closing. Under the terms of the $225 Million Term Loan Facility, we are permitted to add one or more incremental term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $100 million (the Accordion\u201d), subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions. On April 15, 2016, we exercised the Accordion in full, thereby increasing the aggregate amount outstanding under the $225 Million Term Loan Facility to $225 million. The maturity date of the $225 Million Term Loan Facility is January 14, 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we completed the sale of five of our properties for an aggregate gross sales price of $40.7 million. The net cash proceeds from these dispositions, which totaled $38.5 million, were used to acquire three properties in three separate 1031 Exchange transactions.\nThe following tables set forth our leasing activity for new and renewal leases on a quarterly basis for the year ended December 31, 2016:\nThe following table sets forth certain information with respect to our consolidated indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2016:\n \u2022 During 2016, we leased-up four of our value-add repositioning properties located at 2610 & 2701 Birch Street, 24105 Frampton Avenue, 12247 Lakeland Road and 15140 & 15148 Bledsoe Street. As of December 31, 2016, three of our repositioning properties are in the lease-up phase.  Dispositions\nOur Same Properties Portfolio property expenses increased by $1.2 million or 5.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in real estate tax expense and repairs and maintenance. The increase in real estate tax expense was due to supplemental assessments of certain of our properties resulting in lower real estate taxes during the year ended December 31, 2015, and a decrease in capitalized real estate taxes for properties under repositioning for comparable periods. Our Total Portfolio property expenses increased by $8.6 million, or 34.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the incremental expenses from the 41 properties we acquired during 2015 and 2016.\nAcquisition Expenses\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nThe gain from early repayment of note receivable of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, represents the recognition of the unamortized accretable yield related to the collection of the Calle Perfecto Note.\nOur Total Portfolio interest expense increased by $6.4 million, or 75.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to the following: (i) an increase in interest expense from the $225 million term loan facility which was fully drawn upon in April 2016, (ii) the issuance of $100 million of 4.29% fixed rate senior notes in August 2015 and subsequent repayment of two secured loans aggregating $91.3 million with a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.76% and (iii) the effect of four interest rate swaps, with an aggregate notional value of $160 million, that became effective between January 2015 and February 2016. These increases were partially offset by the following: (i) higher capitalized interest resulting from an increase in construction activity related to our repositioning properties and (ii) a decrease in interest expense from the reduced usage of our unsecured revolving credit facility during 2016.\nAs summarized in the table above, as of December 31, 2016, seven of our properties with a combined 0.8 million vacant rentable square feet, were currently in various stages of redevelopment, repositioning or lease-up. These seven properties are concentrated in our Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego markets, and represent 5.3% of our total consolidated portfolio square footage as of December 31, 2016. Including vacant repositioning space and lease-up space at these seven properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2016, in Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego was 92.1%, 96.1% and 81.0%, respectively. Excluding vacant repositioning space and lease-up space at these seven properties, our weighted average occupancy rate as of December 31, 2016, in these markets was 97.9%, 96.7% and 97.3%, respectively, and our overall portfolio occupancy excluding these properties was 96.8%. We believe that a significant portion of our long-term future growth will come from the completion of these projects currently under or scheduled for repositioning, as well as through the identification or acquisition of new opportunities for redevelopment and repositioning, whether in our existing portfolio or through new investments, which may vary from period to period subject to market conditions.\nOn July 6, 2016, we acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in the property located at 3233 Mission Oaks Boulevard from our unconsolidated joint venture (the JV\u201d). Prior to the acquisition, our ownership interest in the property was 15.0%. Equity in income from unconsolidated real estate entities includes our 15.0% equity interest in the operating results of the JV property prior to July 6, 2016, depreciation of basis adjustments related to the JV property and distributions received from the JV in connection with the sale of the property that exceeded the carrying value of our investment in the JV (the excess distributions\u201d). Our Total Portfolio equity in income from unconsolidated real estate entities increased by $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the excess distributions totaling $1.9 million that we received from the JV, partially offset by the write-off of the $0.6 million unamortized basis adjustment related to the JV property. For additional information, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Measure: EBITDA\nLoss on Sale of Real Estate\nDepreciation and Amortization\nInterest on the $225 Million Term Loan Facility accrues based upon, at our option, either (i) LIBOR plus the applicable Eurodollar rate margin or (ii) the applicable base rate which is the greater of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the administrative agent's prime rate or (c) the thirty-day LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus the applicable base rate margin. Until we obtain an investment grade rating by two or more of Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch Ratings, and elect to use the alternative rates based on our debt rating, the applicable Eurodollar rate margin will range from 1.50% to 2.25% per annum, and the applicable base rate margin will range from 0.50% to 1.25% per annum, depending on our Leverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement).\n \u2022 In February 2017, we entered into an agreement for a $450 million senior unsecured credit facility, comprised of a $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will mature in February 2021, with two six-month extensions available, and a $100 million unsecured term loan facility that will mature in February 2022. Borrowings under the $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin that will range from 1.10% to 1.50% per annum depending on our leverage ratio, and the $100 million unsecured term loan facility bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin that will range from 1.20% to 1.70% per annum depending on our leverage ratio. \n (5) The GAAP and cash re-leasing rent spreads for renewal leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2016, exclude 36 leases aggregating 252,872 rentable square feet for which there was no comparable lease data due to either (i) space with different lease structures or (ii) space with lease terms shorter than six months. \n \u2022 For the $225 Million Term Loan Facility, maintaining a minimum tangible net worth of at least the sum of (i) $283,622,250 and (ii) an amount equal to at least 75% of the net equity proceeds received by our company after March 31, 2014; \nScheduled Lease Expirations\nIncome From Discontinued Operations\n (7) The $200 million unsecured revolving credit facility is subject to an unused commitment fee, which is calculated as 0.30% or 0.20% of the daily-unused commitment if the balance is under $100 million or over $100 million, respectively. \nEquity in income (loss) from unconsolidated real estate entities includes our equity interests in the operating results of the properties held by our JV and basis adjustments related to these properties. In November 2014, the JV sold two of the three properties owned by the JV. Our Total Portfolio equity in income (loss) from unconsolidated real estate entities increased by $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the change in basis adjustments following the sale of these properties.\nThe following table sets forth the revenue and expense items comprising NOI and the adjustments to calculate Cash NOI (in thousands):\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors,\u201d Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Business\u201d and our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n (6) On December 31, 2016, the full building lease held by Money Mailer Holding Corporation expired, and we subsequently began our repositioning of this building. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, we entered into a short-term lease with a tenant who will occupy approximately 100,000 rentable square feet during the construction period. This tenant is required to relocate within the building throughout construction so that we can complete our repositioning of the building. We have the right to terminate this short-term lease to coincide with the future leasing of the repositioned building. \n (6) As of December 31, 2016, $100 million term loan facility has been effectively fixed at 1.8975% plus the applicable LIBOR margin through the use of two interest rate swaps as follows: (i) $50 million with a strike rate of 1.79% with an effective date of August 14, 2015, and (ii) $50 million with a strike rate of 2.005% with an effective date of February 16, 2016. \nTaxable REIT Subsidiary\nUnsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility",
