This leasing volume was highlighted by a historically:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>high volume of square feet renewed, which contributed to a tenant retention rate of 78.4% for the year (defined below in the section entitled Occupancy and Leasing\u201d); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>near high volume of development space leasing driven primarily by demand for Data Center Shell space.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that this leasing activity is reflective of strengthening demand for space in our Defense/IT Locations driven primarily by:\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a healthier and more predictable defense spending environment and bipartisan support to fund defense. Clarity regarding defense funding tends to improve the government's process for awarding contracts to prospective tenants, which improves our ability to lease space in Defense/IT Locations properties. We believe that the government's successive increases in defense funding for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 served to bring such clarity relative to prior years and, in turn, fueled much of the growth in demand for office space by the United States Government and its contractors that we observed in 2018. In addition, despite the government starting its fiscal year 2018 under yet another budget Continuing Resolution, the fiscal year: 2018 budget was ultimately signed into law during the year; and 2019 Department of Defense appropriations were\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nenacted in September 2018, representing the first time in ten years that the department received its annual appropriations on time. These budgets included increased funding levels for the Department of Defense's discretionary base budget authority of 14% from fiscal year 2017 to 2018 and 2% from fiscal year 2018 to 2019; and\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continued strong demand for data center shell space. Data center shells have been a significant growth driver for our Defense/IT Locations in recent years. Development leasing of data center shells totaled 798,000 square feet in 2018, 743,000 square feet in 2017 and 728,000 square feet in 2016. All of this leasing pertained to properties in Northern Virginia, one of the largest data center markets in the world, and represented further expansion of our relationship with an existing tenant.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAfter ending 2017 with our office and data center shell portfolio 93.6% occupied, our highest year-end occupancy since 2005, we ended 2018 with the portfolio 93.0% occupied. This decrease in occupancy was due primarily to the addition in 2018 of unoccupied space in a newly-constructed property targeted for United States Government use that has taken longer than expected to lease. Our Same Properties (defined below) were 93.0% occupied as of December 31, 2018, an increase from 92.1% as of December 31, 2017, with average occupancy of 91.5% in 2018.\nWe had an active year for development activities in 2018, with 688,000 square feet placed in service in six newly-constructed and one redeveloped Defense/IT Location properties, including 514,000 square feet of data center shell space. These properties were 90.3% leased as of December 31, 2018. We also placed into service land that was 100% leased under a long-term contract as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we had ten properties under construction or redevelopment that we estimate will total approximately 1.3 million square feet upon completion, including two partially-operational properties.\nFrom a capital perspective in 2018:\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>we had cash outlays of $160.0 million during the year to fund construction, development and redevelopment costs initially funded primarily from borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>COPT issued:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>5.9 million common shares under forward equity sale agreements originated in 2017 for net proceeds of $172.5 million; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u25e6\n</td> <td>992,000 common shares at a weighted average price of $30.46 per share under its existing at-the-market ( ATM\u201d) stock offering program (the 2016 ATM Program\u201d) for net proceeds of $29.8 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> COPT contributed the net proceeds from these issuances to COPLP in exchange for an equal number of units in COPLP. The proceeds were used primarily to repay borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility; and\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>we ended 2018 with $1.82 billion in debt, which was virtually unchanged from year end 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile net operating income ( NOI\u201d) from real estate operations, our segment performance measure discussed further below, decreased by approximately $3 million from 2017 to 2018 in total and for our Same Properties, these results varied significantly between our segments. Most notably, and as discussed further in the section below entitled Results of Operations,\u201d our Same Properties NOI from real estate operations increased $3.7 million for our Defense/IT Locations properties but decreased $5.7 million for our Regional Office properties. Our net income increased $3.7 million from 2017 to 2018, which included: a $12.8 million decrease in impairment losses; offset in part by a $7.6 million decrease in gain on sales of real estate.\nWe discuss significant factors contributing to changes in our net income over the last three years in the section below entitled Results of Operations.\u201d The results of operations discussion is combined for COPT and COPLP because there are no material differences in the results of operations between the two reporting entities.\nIn addition, the section below entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d includes discussions of, among other things:\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>how we expect to generate cash for short and long-term capital needs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our commitments and contingencies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe refer to the measure annualized rental revenue\u201d in various sections of the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Annualized rental revenue is a measure that we use to evaluate the source of our rental revenue as of a point in time. It is computed by multiplying by 12 the sum of monthly contractual base rents and estimated monthly expense reimbursements under active leases as of a point in time (ignoring free rent then in effect). Our computation of annualized rental revenue excludes the effect of lease incentives, although the effect of this exclusion is not material. We consider annualized rental revenue to be a useful measure for analyzing revenue sources because, since it is point-in-time based, it does not contain increases and decreases in revenue\nassociated with periods in which lease terms were not in effect; historical revenue under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) does contain such fluctuations. We find the measure particularly useful for leasing, tenant, segment and industry analysis.\nWith regard to our operating portfolio square footage, occupancy and leasing statistics included below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, amounts disclosed:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>include total information pertaining to six properties owned through an unconsolidated real estate joint venture except for amounts reported for annualized rental revenue, which represent the portion attributable to our ownership interest;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>exclude, for purposes of amounts reported as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the unoccupied portion of two newly-constructed properties that were completed but reported as construction projects since they were held for future lease to the United States Government.

Accordingly, we did not recognize the sale of this property for accounting purposes until the expiration of the guaranty on October 1, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to make certain estimates and assumptions. A summary of our significant accounting policies is provided in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The following section is a summary of certain aspects of those accounting policies involving estimates and assumptions that (1) require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in accounting for uncertain matters or matters that are susceptible to change and (2) materially affect our reported operating performance or financial condition. It is possible that the use of different reasonable estimates or assumptions in making these judgments could result in materially different amounts being reported in our consolidated financial statements. While reviewing this section, refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, including terms defined therein.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess each of our properties and related intangible assets for indicators of impairment quarterly or when circumstances indicate that a property may be impaired. We review our plans and intentions for our development projects and land parcels quarterly. If our analyses indicate that the carrying values of operating properties, properties in development or land held for future development may be impaired, we perform a recovery analysis for such properties. For long-lived assets to be held and used, we analyze recoverability based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the operations and eventual disposition of the assets over, in most cases, a ten-year holding period. If we believe there is a significant possibility that we might dispose of the assets earlier, we analyze recoverability using a probability weighted analysis of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the operations and eventual disposition of the assets over the various possible holding periods. If the analysis indicates that the carrying value of a tested property is not recoverable from estimated future cash flows, it is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. If and when our plans change, we revise our recoverability analyses to use the cash flows expected from the operations and eventual disposition of each asset using holding periods that are consistent with our revised plans.\nProperty fair values are estimated based on contract prices, indicative bids, discounted cash flow analyses or comparable sales analyses. Estimated cash flows used in such analyses are based on our plans for the property and our views of market and economic conditions. The estimates consider items such as current and future rental rates, occupancies for the tested property and comparable properties, estimated operating and capital expenditures and recent sales data for comparable properties; most of these items are influenced by market data obtained from real estate leasing and brokerage firms and our direct experience with the properties and their markets. Determining the appropriate capitalization or yield rate also requires significant judgment and is typically based on many factors, including the prevailing rate for the market or submarket, as well as the quality and location of the property. Changes in the estimated future cash flows due to changes in our plans for a property (especially our expected holding period), views of market and economic conditions and/or our ability to obtain development rights could result in recognition of impairment losses which could be substantial.\nProperties held for sale are carried at the lower of their carrying values (i.e., cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment loss recognized, where applicable) or estimated fair values less costs to sell. Accordingly, decisions to sell certain operating properties, properties in development or land held for development will result in impairment losses if carrying values of the specific properties exceed their estimated fair values less costs to sell. The estimates of fair value consider matters such\nas recent sales data for comparable properties and, where applicable, contracts or the results of negotiations with prospective purchasers. These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions, and our assessment of such conditions, change.\nAcquisitions of Operating Properties\nWhen we acquire properties, we allocate the purchase price to numerous tangible and intangible components. Most of the terms in this bullet section are discussed in further detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements entitled Acquisitions of Operating Properties.\u201d Our process for determining the allocation to these components requires many estimates and assumptions, including the following: (1) determination of market rental rates; (2) estimation of leasing and tenant improvement costs associated with the remaining term of acquired leases; (3) assumptions used in determining the in-place lease value, if-vacant value and tenant relationship value, including the rental rates, period of time that it would take to lease vacant space and estimated tenant improvement and leasing costs; (4) renewal probabilities; and (5) allocation of the if-vacant value between land and building. A change in any of the above key assumptions can materially change not only the presentation of acquired properties in our consolidated financial statements but also our reported results of operations. The allocation to different components affects the following:\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the amount of the purchase price allocated among different categories of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets; the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions; and the amount of gain recognized in our consolidated statements of operations should we determine that the fair value of the acquisition exceeds its cost;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>where the amortization of the components appear over time in our consolidated statements of operations. Allocations to above- and below-market leases are amortized into rental revenue, whereas allocations to most of the other tangible and intangible assets are amortized into depreciation and amortization expense. As a REIT, this is important to us since much of the investment community evaluates our operating performance using non-GAAP measures such as funds from operations, the computation of which includes rental revenue but does not include depreciation and amortization expense; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the timing over which the items are recognized as revenue or expense in our consolidated statements of operations. For example, for allocations to the as-if vacant value, the land portion is not depreciated and the building portion is depreciated over a longer period of time than the other components (generally 40 years). Allocations to above- and below-market leases, in-place lease value and tenant relationship value are amortized over significantly shorter timeframes, and if individual tenants' leases are terminated early, any unamortized amounts remaining associated with those tenants are written off upon termination. These differences in timing can materially affect our reported results of operations. In addition, we establish lives for tenant relationship values based on our estimates of how long we expect the respective tenants to remain in the properties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAssessment of Lease Term\nAs discussed above, a significant portion of our portfolio is leased to the United States Government, and the majority of those leases consist of a series of one-year renewal options, or provide for early termination rights. In addition, certain other leases in our portfolio provide early termination rights to tenants. Applicable accounting guidance requires us to recognize minimum rental payments on a straight-line basis over the terms of each lease and to assess the lease terms as including all periods for which failure to renew, or continue, the lease imposes a penalty on the lessee in such amounts that renewal, or continuation, appears, at the inception of the lease, to be reasonably assured. Factors we consider when determining whether a penalty is significant include the uniqueness of the purpose or location of the property, the availability of a comparable replacement property, the relative importance or significance of the property to the continuation of the lessee's line of business and the existence of leasehold improvements or other assets whose value would be impaired by the lessee vacating or discontinuing use of the leased property. For virtually all of our leases with the United States Government, we have concluded, based on the factors above, that exercise of existing renewal options, or continuation of such leases without exercising early termination rights, is reasonably assured. Changes in these assessments could result in the write-off of any recorded assets associated with straight-line rental revenue and acceleration of depreciation and amortization expense associated with costs we incurred related to these leases.\nRevenue Recognition on Tenant Improvements\nMost of our leases involve some form of improvements to leased space. When we are required to provide improvements under the terms of a lease, we need to determine whether the improvements constitute landlord assets or tenant assets. If the improvements are landlord assets, we capitalize the cost of the improvements and recognize depreciation expense associated with such improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or the term of the lease and recognize any payments from the tenant as rental revenue over the term of the lease. If the improvements are tenant assets, we defer the cost of improvements funded by us as a lease incentive asset and amortize it as a reduction of rental revenue over the term of the lease. Our determination of whether improvements are landlord assets or tenant assets also may affect when we commence revenue recognition in connection with a lease.\nIn determining whether improvements constitute landlord or tenant assets, we consider numerous factors that may require subjective or complex judgments, including: whether the improvements are unique to the tenant or reusable by other tenants; whether the tenant is permitted to alter or remove the improvements without our consent or without compensating us for any lost fair value; whether the ownership of the improvements remains with us or remains with the tenant at the end of the lease term; and whether the economic substance of the lease terms is properly reflected.\nCollectability of Accounts and Deferred Rent Receivable\nAllowances for doubtful accounts and deferred rent receivable are established based on quarterly analyses of the risk of loss on specific accounts. The analyses place particular emphasis on past-due accounts and consider information such as the nature and age of the receivables, the payment history of the tenants, the financial condition of the tenants and our assessment of their ability to meet their lease obligations, the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations. Our estimate of the required allowance is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on tenants.\nActivities we conduct to monitor the credit quality of our tenants include the following: monitoring the timeliness of tenant lease payments; reviewing credit ratings of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit agency prior to such tenants' entry into leases, and monitoring periodically thereafter; reviewing financial statements of tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be provided to us pursuant to the terms of such tenants' leases; and monitoring news reports regarding our tenants.\nAccounting Method for Investments\nWe use three different accounting methods to report our investments in entities: the consolidation method; the equity method; or at fair value through net income (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). We use the consolidation method when we own most of the outstanding voting interests in an entity and can control its operations. We also consolidate certain entities when control of such entities can be achieved through means other than voting rights ( variable interest entities\u201d or VIEs\u201d) if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Generally, this applies to entities for which either: (1) the equity investors (if any) lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest; (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support; or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest. We use the equity method of accounting when we own an interest in an entity and can exert significant influence over, but cannot control, the entity's operations. We use the fair value method of accounting when we own an equity interest in an entity and cannot exert significant influence over its operations.\nIn making these determinations, we must consider both our and our partner's ability to participate in the management of the entity's operations and make decisions that could significantly affect the entity's performance and allow the parties to manage their economic risks. We need to make subjective estimates and judgments regarding the entity's planned activities and expected future operating performance, financial condition, future valuation and other variables that may affect the cash flows of the entity. We may also need to estimate the probability of different scenarios taking place over time and their effect on the partners' cash flows. The conclusion reached as a result of this process affects whether or not we use the consolidation method in accounting for our investment or the equity method.

The annualized rents of this leasing totaled $23.48 per square foot and the GAAP rents totaled $23.82 per square foot; these leases had a weighted average lease term of approximately 7.4 years and the per annum average estimated tenant improvements and lease costs associated with completing this leasing was approximately $5.72 per square foot.\nWholesale Data Center\nOur 19.25 megawatt wholesale data center had 16.86 megawatts leased as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nLease Expirations\nThe table below sets forth as of December 31, 2018 our scheduled lease expirations based on the non-cancelable term of tenant leases determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for our operating properties by segment/sub-segment in terms of percentage of annualized rental revenue: Table 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Expiration of Annualized Rental Revenue of Operating Properties\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Defense/IT Locations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fort Meade/BW Corridor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Northern Virginia Defense/IT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lackland Air Force Base\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Navy Support Locations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redstone Arsenal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data Center Shells\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional Office\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale Data Center\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor our office and data center shell properties, our weighted average lease term as of December 31, 2018 was approximately 4.9 years. We believe that the weighted average annualized rental revenue per occupied square foot for our office and data center shell property leases expiring in 2019 was, on average, approximately 1% to 3% higher than estimated current market rents for the related space, with specific results varying by segment. Our wholesale data center had scheduled lease expirations in 2020 for 73% of its annualized rental revenue.\nMost of the leases with our largest tenant, the United States Government, provide for consecutive one-year terms with automatic renewals; most of the leasing statistics set forth above assume that the United States Government will remain in the space that they lease through the end of the respective arrangements without ending consecutive one-year leases prematurely.\nResults of Operations\nWe evaluate the operating performance of our properties using NOI from real estate operations, our segment performance measure, which includes: real estate revenues and property operating expenses; and the net of revenues and property operating expenses of real estate operations owned through unconsolidated real estate joint ventures ( UJVs\u201d) that is allocable to COPT's ownership interest ( UJV NOI allocable to COPT\u201d). We view our NOI from real estate operations as comprising the following primary categories:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>office and data center shell properties:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continually owned and 100% operational throughout the two years being compared, excluding properties held for sale.

The primary manner in which we evaluate the operating performance of our construction management and other service activities is through a measure we define as NOI from service operations, which is based on the net of the revenues and expenses from these activities. The revenues and expenses from these activities consist primarily of subcontracted costs that are reimbursed to us by customers along with a management fee. The operating margins from these activities are small relative to the revenue. We believe NOI\nfrom service operations is a useful measure in assessing both our level of activity and our profitability in conducting such operations.\nSince both of the measures discussed above exclude certain items includable in net income, reliance on these measures has limitations; management compensates for these limitations by using the measures simply as supplemental measures that are considered alongside other GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of NOI from real estate operations and NOI from service operations to net income reported on the consolidated statements of operations of COPT and subsidiaries is provided in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\nComparison of Statements of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

This pool of properties included the following changes from the pool used for purposes of comparing 2017 and 2016 in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K: the addition of 14 properties placed in service and 100% operational on or before January 1, 2017 (including six unconsolidated real estate joint venture properties and two properties added to our rentable square feet in 2018 that were previously reported as construction projects since they were held for future lease to the United States Government); and the removal of one property in 2018 for which we have no leasing plan or intention to allocate future capital and one property reclassified as redevelopment.\nAs reflected above, our decrease in Same Properties NOI from real estate operations was due to a 15.7% decrease in our Regional Office segment from 2017 to 2018, offset in part by a 1.5% increase in our Defense/IT Locations from 2017 to 2018. The decrease in the Regional Office segment was due primarily to decreased occupancy in the segment's Northern Virginia submarkets and an increase in operating expenses, net of tenant recovery revenue, in our Baltimore City properties.\nOur NOI from constructed and redeveloped properties placed in service included 16 properties and land under a long-term contract placed in service in 2017 and 2018.\nOur property operating expense included bad debt expense of $339,000 in 2018 and $378,000 in 2017, each representing 0.07% of our revenue from real estate operations for the respective years.\nNOI from Service Operations\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction contract and other service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41,981\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction contract and other service expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41,292\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NOI from service operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(689\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConstruction contract and other service revenue and expenses decreased due primarily to a lower volume of construction activity in connection with several of our tenants. Construction contract activity is inherently subject to significant variability depending on the volume and nature of projects undertaken by us (primarily on behalf of tenants). Service operations are an ancillary component of our overall operations that typically contribute an insignificant amount of income relative to our real estate operations.\nImpairment Losses\nAs discussed further below, the decrease in impairment losses was attributable primarily to impairment losses recognized in our Aberdeen, Maryland ( Aberdeen\u201d) portfolio in 2017.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we abandoned plans to redevelop a property in our Fort Meade/BW Corridor sub-segment after we completed leasing on the property that did not require any redevelopment. Accordingly, we recognized an impairment loss of $2.4 million representing pre-development costs associated with the property.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, our assessment of weakening leasing prospects and expected enduring vacancy in our Aberdeen portfolio indicated that these properties could be impaired. We performed recovery analyses on the properties considering weakening tenant demand, high vacancy and low investor demand for office properties in the submarket and concluded that the carrying values of these properties were not likely to be recovered from the expected undiscounted cash flows from the operation and eventual disposition of these properties. Accordingly, we recognized $9.0 million of impairment losses on the operating properties in Aberdeen (included in our Other segment). In addition, and also considering these conditions, we determined that we would not likely recover the carrying amount of land in this submarket and recognized a $4.7 million impairment loss on it. We previously recognized impairment losses on these properties in the second quarter of 2016 as discussed below. We determined that the declines in values that have occurred since the initial losses were recognized were due to deteriorating market conditions.\nDuring 2017, we performed recoverability analyses for our properties classified as held for sale, which resulted in impairment losses of $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2017. These impairment losses were primarily on properties in White Marsh, Maryland ( White Marsh\u201d) (included in our Regional Office and Other segments) that we reclassified to held for sale during the period and adjusted to fair value less costs to sell. These properties were sold in the third quarter of 2017.\nChanges in the expected future cash flows due to changes in our plans for specific properties (especially our expected holding period) could result in the recognition of additional impairment losses. In addition, because properties held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair values less costs to sell, declines in their estimated fair values due to market conditions and other factors could result in the recognition of additional impairment losses.\nGeneral, Administrative and Leasing Expenses\nWe capitalize compensation and indirect costs associated with properties, or portions thereof, undergoing construction, development and redevelopment activities. We also capitalize compensation costs associated with obtaining new tenant leases or extending existing tenants. Capitalized compensation and indirect costs were as follows:\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

These changes were due primarily to occupancy changes in the respective segments.\nOur NOI from constructed properties placed in service included 17 properties placed in service in 2016 and 2017.\nOur property operating expense included bad debt expense of $378,000 in 2017 and none in 2016.\nNOI from Service Operations\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction contract and other service revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction contract and other service expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NOI from service operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConstruction contract and other service revenue and expenses increased due primarily to a greater volume of construction activity in connection with several of our tenants.\nImpairment Losses\nAs discussed further below, the decrease in impairment losses was attributable primarily to decisions by us in 2016 to either sell, or abandon plans to develop, properties.\nRefer to 2017 impairment losses described above in our explanation for 2018 losses as compared to 2017.\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we set a goal to raise cash from sales of properties in 2016 considerably in excess of our assets held for sale at December 31, 2015. The specific properties we would sell to achieve this goal had not been identified when the goal was established. Throughout 2016, we engaged in the process of identifying properties we would sell.\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we reclassified: most of our properties in Greater Philadelphia (included in our Regional Office segment); two properties in the Fort Meade/BW Corridor sub-segment; and our remaining land holdings in Colorado Springs, Colorado ( Colorado Springs\u201d) to held for sale and recognized $2.4 million of impairment losses. As of March 31, 2016, we had $225.9 million of assets held for sale.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, as part of our closing process, we conducted our quarterly review of our portfolio for indicators of impairment considering the refined investment strategy of our then newly-appointed Chief Executive Officer and the goals of the asset sales program and concluded that we would: (1) not hold our operating properties in Aberdeen for the long-term; (2) not develop commercial properties on land in Frederick, Maryland; (3) sell specific properties in our Northern Virginia Defense/IT and Fort Meade/BW Corridor sub-segments; and (4) sell the remaining operating property in Greater Philadelphia that had not previously been classified as held for sale. Accordingly, we performed recoverability analyses for each of these properties and recorded the following impairment losses:\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$34.4 million on operating properties in Aberdeen (included in our Other segment). After shortening our estimated holding period for these properties, we determined that the carrying amount of the properties would not likely be recovered from the operation and eventual dispositions of the properties during the shortened holding period. Accordingly, we adjusted the properties to their estimated fair values;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$4.4 million on land in Aberdeen. In performing our analysis related to the operating properties in Aberdeen, we determined that the weakening leasing and overall commercial real estate conditions in that market indicated that our land holdings in the market may be impaired.

In connection with our determinations that we planned to sell these properties, we performed recoverability analyses for each of these properties and recorded the following impairment losses:\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$13.3 million on the operating property in our Northern Virginia Defense/IT sub-segment. Communication with a major tenant in the building during the quarter led us to conclude that there was significant uncertainty with respect to the tenant renewing its lease expiring in 2019. As a result of this information and continuing sub-market weakness, we determined that this property no longer met our long-term hold strategy and we placed it into our asset sales program. Accordingly, we adjusted the carrying amount of the property to its estimated fair value less costs to sell; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$2.9 million on the other properties that we reclassified as held for sale, primarily associated with a land parcel in White Marsh. As of June 30, 2016, this land was under a sales contract subject to a re-zoning contingency. During the third quarter, we were denied favorable re-zoning and the contract was canceled. As a result, we determined this property will be sold as is, reclassified it to held for sale and adjusted its carrying value to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring our review we also recognized additional impairment losses of $11.5 million on properties previously classified as held for sale. Approximately $10.0 million of these losses pertained to properties in White Marsh due to our assessment that certain significant tenants will likely exercise lease termination rights and to reflect market conditions. The remainder of these losses pertained primarily to properties in San Antonio, Texas (included in our Other segment), where prospective purchasers reduced offering prices late in the third quarter. We executed property sales of $210.7 million in the third quarter of 2016 (discussed further in Note 5), and had $161.5 million of assets held for sale as of September 30, 2016.\nWe executed property sales of $54.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 (discussed further in Note 5), and had $94.7 million of assets held for sale as of December 31, 2016. As part of our closing process for the fourth quarter, we conducted our quarterly review of our portfolio for indicators of impairment and found there to be no impairment losses for the quarter other than additional impairment losses of $1.3 million on properties previously classified as held for sale in White Marsh, where prospective purchasers reduced offering prices, and $0.3 million of losses on properties that were sold during the period.\nChanges in the expected future cash flows due to changes in our plans for specific properties (especially our expected holding period) could result in the recognition of additional impairment losses. In addition, because properties held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair values less costs to sell, declines in their estimated fair values due to market conditions and other factors could result in the recognition of additional impairment losses.\nGeneral, Administrative and Leasing Expenses\nThe decrease in general, administrative and leasing expenses from 2016 to 2017 was attributable primarily to $6.5 million of executive transition costs incurred in 2016, representing mostly severance and termination benefits in connection with the departures of former executive officers, compared to $732,000 in such costs recognized in 2017. Capitalized compensation and indirect costs were as follows:\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction, development, redevelopment, capital and tenant improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense\nThe table below sets forth components of our interest expense: Table 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Unsecured Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on mortgage and other secured debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,721\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on unsecured term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>714\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,645\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense recognized on interest rate swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,014\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>908\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,229\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,723\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,180\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur average outstanding debt decreased from $2.0 billion in 2016 to $1.9 billion in 2017, and our weighted average effective interest rate on debt was approximately 4.1% in 2017 and 2016.\nGain on Sales of Real Estate\nIn 2017, we recognized gain on sales of real estate of $5.4 million in connection with land sales and $4.5 million on sales of operating properties. In 2016, we recognized gain on sales of real estate of $17.9 million on our sale of a 50% interest in six single-tenant data center properties, $15.9 million on sales of other operating properties and $7.2 million on land sales.\nFunds from Operations\nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d) is defined as net income computed using GAAP, excluding gains on sales of, and impairment losses on, previously depreciated operating properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization. When multiple properties consisting of both operating and non-operating properties exist on a single tax parcel, we classify all of the gains on sales of, and impairment losses on, the tax parcel as all being for previously depreciated operating properties when most of the value of the parcel is associated with operating properties on the parcel. FFO also includes adjustments to net income for the effects of the items noted above pertaining to UJVs that were allocable to our ownership interest in the UJVs. We believe that we use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) definition of FFO, although others may interpret the definition differently and, accordingly, our presentation of FFO may differ from those of other REITs. We believe that FFO is useful to management and investors as a supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains related to sales of, and impairment losses on, previously depreciated operating properties, net of related tax benefit, and excluding real estate-related depreciation and amortization, FFO can help one compare our operating performance between periods. In addition, since most equity REITs provide FFO information to the investment community, we believe that FFO is useful to investors as a supplemental measure for comparing our results to those of other equity REITs. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO.\nSince FFO excludes certain items includable in net income, reliance on the measure has limitations; management compensates for these limitations by using the measure simply as a supplemental measure that is weighed in balance with other GAAP and non-GAAP measures. FFO is not necessarily an indication of our cash flow available to fund cash needs. Additionally, it should not be used as an alternative to net income when evaluating our financial performance or to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities when evaluating our liquidity or ability to make cash distributions or pay debt service.\nBasic FFO available to common share and common unit holders ( Basic FFO\u201d) is FFO adjusted to subtract (1) preferred share dividends, (2) issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred shares, (3) income attributable to noncontrolling interests through ownership of preferred units in the Operating Partnership or interests in other consolidated entities not owned by us, (4) depreciation and amortization allocable to noncontrolling interests in other consolidated entities and (5) Basic FFO allocable to restricted shares. With these adjustments, Basic FFO represents FFO available to common shareholders and common unitholders. Common units in the Operating Partnership are substantially similar to our common shares and are exchangeable into common shares, subject to certain conditions. We believe that Basic FFO is useful to investors due to the close correlation of common units to common shares. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP\nmeasure to Basic FFO. Basic FFO has essentially the same limitations as FFO; management compensates for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for FFO.\nDiluted FFO available to common share and common unit holders ( Diluted FFO\u201d) is Basic FFO adjusted to add back any changes in Basic FFO that would result from the assumed conversion of securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common shares. We believe that Diluted FFO is useful to investors because it is the numerator used to compute Diluted FFO per share, discussed below. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Diluted FFO. Since Diluted FFO excludes certain items includable in the numerator to diluted EPS, reliance on the measure has limitations; management compensates for these limitations by using the measure simply as a supplemental measure that is weighed in the balance with other GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Diluted FFO is not necessarily an indication of our cash flow available to fund cash needs. Additionally, it should not be used as an alternative to net income when evaluating our financial performance or to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities when evaluating our liquidity or ability to make cash distributions or pay debt service.\nDiluted FFO available to common share and common unit holders, as adjusted for comparability is defined as Diluted FFO adjusted to exclude: operating property acquisition costs; gains on sales of, and impairment losses on, properties other than previously depreciated operating properties, net of associated income tax; gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt; FFO associated with properties securing non-recourse debt on which we have defaulted and which we have extinguished, or expect to extinguish, via conveyance of such properties, including property NOI, interest expense and gains on debt extinguishment (discussed further below); loss on interest rate derivatives; demolition costs on redevelopment and nonrecurring improvements; executive transition costs; and issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred shares. This measure also includes adjustments for the effects of the items noted above pertaining to UJVs that were allocable to our ownership interest in the UJVs. We believe this to be a useful supplemental measure alongside Diluted FFO as it excludes gains and losses from certain investing and financing activities and certain other items that we believe are not closely correlated to (or associated with) our operating performance. The adjustment for FFO associated with properties securing non-recourse debt on which we have defaulted pertains to the periods subsequent to our default on one loan's payment terms, which was the result of our decision to not support payments on the loan since the estimated fair value of the properties was less than the loan balance. While we continued as the legal owner of the properties during this period up until the transfer of ownership, all cash flows produced by them went directly to the lender and we did not fund any debt service shortfalls, which included incremental additional interest under the default rate of $5.3 million in 2015 and $5.8 million in 2014. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to this non-GAAP measure. This measure has essentially the same limitations as Diluted FFO, as well as the further limitation of not reflecting the effects of the excluded items; we compensate for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for Diluted FFO.\nDiluted FFO per share is (1) Diluted FFO divided by (2) the sum of the (a) weighted average common shares outstanding during a period, (b) weighted average common units outstanding during a period and (c) weighted average number of potential additional common shares that would have been outstanding during a period if other securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common shares were converted or exchanged. We believe that Diluted FFO per share is useful to investors because it provides investors with a further context for evaluating our FFO results in the same manner that investors use earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) in evaluating net income available to common shareholders. In addition, since most equity REITs provide Diluted FFO per share information to the investment community, we believe that Diluted FFO per share is a useful supplemental measure for comparing us to other equity REITs. We believe that diluted EPS is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Diluted FFO per share. Diluted FFO per share has most of the same limitations as Diluted FFO (described above); management compensates for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for Diluted FFO.\nDiluted FFO per share, as adjusted for comparability is (1) Diluted FFO, as adjusted for comparability divided by (2) the sum of the (a) weighted average common shares outstanding during a period, (b) weighted average common units outstanding during a period and (c) weighted average number of potential additional common shares that would have been outstanding during a period if other securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common shares were converted or exchanged. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it provides investors with a further context for evaluating our FFO results. We believe this to be a useful supplemental measure alongside Diluted FFO per share as it excludes gains and losses from certain investing and financing activities and certain other items that we believe are not closely correlated to (or associated with) our operating performance. We believe that diluted EPS is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to this per share measure. This measure has most of the same limitations as Diluted FFO (described above) as well as the further limitation of not reflecting the effects of the excluded items; we compensate for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for Diluted FFO.\nThe computations for all of the above measures on a diluted basis assume the conversion of common units in COPLP but do not assume the conversion of other securities that are convertible into common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase per share measures in a given period.\nWe use measures called payout ratios as supplemental measures of our ability to make distributions to investors based on each of the following: FFO; Diluted FFO; and Diluted FFO, adjusted for comparability. These measures are defined as (1) the sum of (a) dividends on unrestricted common shares and (b) distributions to holders of interests in COPLP and dividends on convertible preferred shares when such distributions and dividends are included in Diluted FFO divided by either (2) FFO, Diluted FFO or Diluted FFO, adjusted for comparability.\nThe table below sets forth the computation of the above stated measures for the years ended December 31, 2014 through 2018 and provides reconciliations to the GAAP measures of COPT and subsidiaries associated with such measures:\nTable 206: <table><tr><td>

general partner of COPLP, conducts almost all of its operations and owns almost all of its assets. COPT occasionally issues public equity but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company that are fully reimbursed by COPLP. COPT itself does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of COPLP. COPT's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common and preferred shares. COPT's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from COPLP.\nAs of December 31, 2018, COPT owned 98.8% of the outstanding common units in COPLP; the remaining common units and all of the outstanding preferred units were owned by third parties. As the sole general partner of COPLP, COPT has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for COPLP's day-to-day management and control.\nThe liquidity of COPT is dependent on COPLP's ability to make sufficient distributions to COPT. The primary cash requirement of COPT is its payment of dividends to its shareholders. COPT also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership's debt, as discussed further in Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein. If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill certain of its debt requirements, which trigger COPT's guarantee obligations, then COPT will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. However, COPT's only significant asset is its investment in COPLP.\nAs discussed further below, we believe that the Operating Partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its Revolving Credit Facility, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to COPT and, in turn, for COPT to make its dividend payments to its shareholders.\nCOPT's short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for future dividends expected to be paid to its shareholders. COPT periodically accesses the public equity markets to raise capital by issuing common and/or preferred shares.\nFor COPT to maintain its qualification as a REIT, it must pay dividends to its shareholders aggregating annually to at least 90% of its ordinary taxable income. As a result of this distribution requirement, it cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that some other companies can. COPT may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund COPLP's working capital needs, development activities and acquisitions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of COPLP\nCOPLP's primary cash requirements are for operating expenses, debt service, development of new properties, improvements to existing properties and acquisitions, to the extent they are pursued in the future. We expect COPLP to continue to use cash flow provided by operations as the primary source to meet its short-term capital needs, including property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, scheduled principal amortization of debt, distributions to its security holders and improvements to existing properties. As of December 31, 2018, COPLP had $8.1 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nCOPLP's senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by the three major rating agencies. We aim to maintain an investment grade rating to enable COPLP to use debt comprised of unsecured, primarily fixed-rate debt (including the effect of interest rate swaps) from public markets and banks. COPLP also uses secured nonrecourse debt from institutional lenders and banks for joint venture financing. In addition, COPLP periodically raises equity from COPT when COPT accesses the public equity markets by issuing common and/or preferred shares.\nCOPLP uses its Revolving Credit Facility to initially finance much of its investing activities. COPLP subsequently pays down the facility using cash available from operations and proceeds from long-term borrowings, equity issuances and sales of interests in properties. The lenders' aggregate commitment under the facility is $800.0 million, with the ability for COPLP to increase the lenders' aggregate commitment to $1.25 billion, provided that there is no default under the facility and subject to the approval of the lenders. The facility matures in March 2023, and may be extended by two six-month periods at COPLP's option, provided that there is no default under the facility and COPLP pays an extension fee of 0.075% of the total availability under the facility for each extension period. As of December 31, 2018, the maximum borrowing capacity under this facility totaled $800.0 million, of which $587.0 million was available.\nAs of December 31, 2018, COPT had forward equity sale agreements in place with 1.6 million shares available for future issuance with a settlement value of $46.4 million that we expect to use to fund development costs in March 2019.\nIn November 2018, COPT replaced its 2016 ATM Program with a new program under which it may offer and sell common shares in at-the-market stock offerings having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $300 million (the 2018 ATM Program\u201d). Under the 2018 ATM Program, COPT may also, at its discretion, sell common shares under forward equity sales agreements. The use of a forward equity sales agreement would enable us to lock in a price on a sale of common shares when the agreement is executed but defer receiving the proceeds from the sale until a later date.\nWe believe that COPLP's liquidity and capital resources are adequate for its near-term and longer-term requirements without necessitating property sales. However, we may dispose of interests in properties opportunistically or when capital markets otherwise warrant.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in

Some of our tenants are obligated to pay their full share of a building's operating expenses. These arrangements somewhat reduce our exposure to increases in such costs resulting from inflation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_truncated": "We evaluate the operating performance of our properties using NOI from real estate operations, our segment performance measure, which includes: real estate revenues and property operating expenses; and the net of revenues and property operating expenses of real estate operations owned through unconsolidated real estate joint ventures ( UJVs\u201d) that is allocable to COPT's ownership interest ( UJV NOI allocable to COPT\u201d). We view our NOI from real estate operations as comprising the following primary categories:\nConstruction contract and other service revenue and expenses decreased due primarily to a lower volume of construction activity in connection with several of our tenants. Construction contract activity is inherently subject to significant variability depending on the volume and nature of projects undertaken by us (primarily on behalf of tenants). Service operations are an ancillary component of our overall operations that typically contribute an insignificant amount of income relative to our real estate operations.\n \u2022 the timing over which the items are recognized as revenue or expense in our consolidated statements of operations. For example, for allocations to the as-if vacant value, the land portion is not depreciated and the building portion is depreciated over a longer period of time than the other components (generally 40 years). Allocations to above- and below-market leases, in-place lease value and tenant relationship value are amortized over significantly shorter timeframes, and if individual tenants' leases are terminated early, any unamortized amounts remaining associated with those tenants are written off upon termination. These differences in timing can materially affect our reported results of operations. In addition, we establish lives for tenant relationship values based on our estimates of how long we expect the respective tenants to remain in the properties. \nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues from real estate operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>517,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>509,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction contract and other service revenues\n</td> <td>60,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41,981\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>578,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>612,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34,708\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property operating expenses\n</td> <td>201,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization associated with real estate operations\n</td> <td>137,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction contract and other service expenses\n</td> <td>58,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41,292\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment losses\n</td> <td>2,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,756\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General, administrative and leasing expenses\n</td> <td>28,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,937\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business development expenses and land carry costs\n</td> <td>5,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(373\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>433,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>476,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43,399\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(75,385\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76,983\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income\n</td> <td>4,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,960\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of real estate\n</td> <td>2,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,550\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>(258\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(513\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in income of unconsolidated entities\n</td> <td>2,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,098\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInflation\nThe table below sets forth as of December 31, 2018 our scheduled lease expirations based on the non-cancelable term of tenant leases determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for our operating properties by segment/sub-segment in terms of percentage of annualized rental revenue: \nOur property operating expense included bad debt expense of $378,000 in 2017 and none in 2016.\nInterest Expense\nBasic FFO available to common share and common unit holders ( Basic FFO\u201d) is FFO adjusted to subtract (1) preferred share dividends, (2) issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred shares, (3) income attributable to noncontrolling interests through ownership of preferred units in the Operating Partnership or interests in other consolidated entities not owned by us, (4) depreciation and amortization allocable to noncontrolling interests in other consolidated entities and (5) Basic FFO allocable to restricted shares.

</tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of COPT\nFor our office and data center shell properties, our weighted average lease term as of December 31, 2018 was approximately 4.9 years. We believe that the weighted average annualized rental revenue per occupied square foot for our office and data center shell property leases expiring in 2019 was, on average, approximately 1% to 3% higher than estimated current market rents for the related space, with specific results varying by segment. Our wholesale data center had scheduled lease expirations in 2020 for 73% of its annualized rental revenue.\nProperty fair values are estimated based on contract prices, indicative bids, discounted cash flow analyses or comparable sales analyses. Estimated cash flows used in such analyses are based on our plans for the property and our views of market and economic conditions. The estimates consider items such as current and future rental rates, occupancies for the tested property and comparable properties, estimated operating and capital expenditures and recent sales data for comparable properties; most of these items are influenced by market data obtained from real estate leasing and brokerage firms and our direct experience with the properties and their markets. Determining the appropriate capitalization or yield rate also requires significant judgment and is typically based on many factors, including the prevailing rate for the market or submarket, as well as the quality and location of the property. Changes in the estimated future cash flows due to changes in our plans for a property (especially our expected holding period), views of market and economic conditions and/or our ability to obtain development rights could result in recognition of impairment losses which could be substantial.\nResults of Operations\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we set a goal to raise cash from sales of properties in 2016 considerably in excess of our assets held for sale at December 31, 2015. The specific properties we would sell to achieve this goal had not been identified when the goal was established. Throughout 2016, we engaged in the process of identifying properties we would sell.\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Annualized Rental Revenue of Office and Data Center Shell Properties as of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of Properties as of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Region\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Defense/IT Locations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fort Meade/BW Corridor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Northern Virginia Defense/IT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lackland Air Force Base\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Navy Support Locations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redstone Arsenal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data Center Shells\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Defense/IT Locations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regional Office\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe capitalize compensation and indirect costs associated with properties, or portions thereof, undergoing construction, development and redevelopment activities.

These budgets included increased funding levels for the Department of Defense's discretionary base budget authority of 14% from fiscal year 2017 to 2018 and 2% from fiscal year 2018 to 2019; and\nAs discussed above, a significant portion of our portfolio is leased to the United States Government, and the majority of those leases consist of a series of one-year renewal options, or provide for early termination rights. In addition, certain other leases in our portfolio provide early termination rights to tenants. Applicable accounting guidance requires us to recognize minimum rental payments on a straight-line basis over the terms of each lease and to assess the lease terms as including all periods for which failure to renew, or continue, the lease imposes a penalty on the lessee in such amounts that renewal, or continuation, appears, at the inception of the lease, to be reasonably assured. Factors we consider when determining whether a penalty is significant include the uniqueness of the purpose or location of the property, the availability of a comparable replacement property, the relative importance or significance of the property to the continuation of the lessee's line of business and the existence of leasehold improvements or other assets whose value would be impaired by the lessee vacating or discontinuing use of the leased property. For virtually all of our leases with the United States Government, we have concluded, based on the factors above, that exercise of existing renewal options, or continuation of such leases without exercising early termination rights, is reasonably assured. Changes in these assessments could result in the write-off of any recorded assets associated with straight-line rental revenue and acceleration of depreciation and amortization expense associated with costs we incurred related to these leases.\nThe computations for all of the above measures on a diluted basis assume the conversion of common units in COPLP but do not assume the conversion of other securities that are convertible into common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase per share measures in a given period.\nIn November 2018, COPT replaced its 2016 ATM Program with a new program under which it may offer and sell common shares in at-the-market stock offerings having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $300 million (the 2018 ATM Program\u201d). Under the 2018 ATM Program, COPT may also, at its discretion, sell common shares under forward equity sales agreements. The use of a forward equity sales agreement would enable us to lock in a price on a sale of common shares when the agreement is executed but defer receiving the proceeds from the sale until a later date.\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Unsecured Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on mortgage and other secured debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,721\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on unsecured term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>714\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,645\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense recognized on interest rate swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,014\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>908\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,229\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,723\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,180\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (3) Includes the addition of 330,000 square feet in two properties that were completed in 2016 but reported as construction projects through December 31, 2017 since they were held for future lease to the United States Government.

indicators of impairment considering the refined investment strategy of our then newly-appointed Chief Executive Officer and the goals of the asset sales program and concluded that we would: (1) not hold our operating properties in Aberdeen for the long-term; (2) not develop commercial properties on land in Frederick, Maryland; (3) sell specific properties in our Northern Virginia Defense/IT and Fort Meade/BW Corridor sub-segments; and (4) sell the remaining operating property in Greater Philadelphia that had not previously been classified as held for sale. Accordingly, we performed recoverability analyses for each of these properties and recorded the following impairment losses:\n \u2022 exclude, for purposes of amounts reported as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the unoccupied portion of two newly-constructed properties that were completed but reported as construction projects since they were held for future lease to the United States Government. Effective in 2018, these properties were fully included in our operating property statistics; and \nCustomer Concentration of Property Operations\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Rentable\nSquare Feet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Occupied\nSquare Feet\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>17,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vacated upon lease expiration (1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(789\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy for new leases (2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>578\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Constructed or redeveloped (3)\n</td> <td>1,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Removed from operations (4)\n</td> <td>(241\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other changes\n</td> <td>(28\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>18,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes lease terminations and space reductions occurring in connection with lease renewals. \nImpairment Losses\n \u2022 include total information pertaining to six properties owned through an unconsolidated real estate joint venture except for amounts reported for annualized rental revenue, which represent the portion attributable to our ownership interest; \nDuring 2017, we performed recoverability analyses for our properties classified as held for sale, which resulted in impairment losses of $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2017. These impairment losses were primarily on properties in White Marsh, Maryland ( White Marsh\u201d) (included in our Regional Office and Other segments) that we reclassified to held for sale during the period and adjusted to fair value less costs to sell. These properties were sold in the third quarter of 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of COPLP\nSince both of the measures discussed above exclude certain items includable in net income, reliance on these measures has limitations; management compensates for these limitations by using the measures simply as supplemental measures that are considered alongside other GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of NOI from real estate operations and NOI from service operations to net income reported on the consolidated statements of operations of COPT and subsidiaries is provided in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 dividends and/or distributions to equity holders of $122.9 million; and \nCOPT's short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for future dividends expected to be paid to its shareholders. COPT periodically accesses the public equity markets to raise capital by issuing common and/or preferred shares.\n \u2022 our wholesale data center. \nWe expect to spend $250 million to $300 million on construction and development costs and approximately $65 million on improvements and leasing costs for operating properties (including the commitments set forth in the table above) in 2019. We expect to fund the construction and development costs initially using primarily borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and proceeds from common shares issued under COPT's forward equity sale agreements. We expect to fund improvements to existing operating properties using cash flow from operating activities.\n (2) Represents scheduled principal amortization payments and maturities only and therefore excludes net debt discounts and deferred financing costs of $14.6 million. As of December 31, 2018, maturities included $213.0 million in 2023 that may be extended to 2024, subject to certain conditions. \n \u2022 our ability to achieve projected results; \nOur NOI from constructed and redeveloped properties placed in service included 16 properties and land under a long-term contract placed in service in 2017 and 2018.\nmeasure to Basic FFO. Basic FFO has essentially the same limitations as FFO; management compensates for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for FFO.\nWe use three different accounting methods to report our investments in entities: the consolidation method; the equity method; or at fair value through net income (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). We use the consolidation method when we own most of the outstanding voting interests in an entity and can control its operations. We also consolidate certain entities when control of such entities can be achieved through means other than voting rights ( variable interest entities\u201d or VIEs\u201d) if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Generally, this applies to entities for which either: (1) the equity investors (if any) lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest; (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support; or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest. We use the equity method of accounting when we own an interest in an entity and can exert significant influence over, but cannot control, the entity's operations. We use the fair value method of accounting when we own an equity interest in an entity and cannot exert significant influence over its operations.\nConcentration of Operations\nMost of our leases involve some form of improvements to leased space. When we are required to provide improvements under the terms of a lease, we need to determine whether the improvements constitute landlord assets or tenant assets. If the improvements are landlord assets, we capitalize the cost of the improvements and recognize depreciation expense associated with such improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or the term of the lease and recognize any payments from the tenant as rental revenue over the term of the lease. If the improvements are tenant assets, we defer the cost of improvements funded by us as a lease incentive asset and amortize it as a reduction of rental revenue over the term of the lease. Our determination of whether improvements are landlord assets or tenant assets also may affect when we commence revenue recognition in connection with a lease.\nThe table below sets forth the 20 largest tenants in our portfolio of operating properties (including our office and data center shell properties and wholesale data center) based on percentage of annualized rental revenue:\nOverview\n \u25e6 5.9 million common shares under forward equity sale agreements originated in 2017 for net proceeds of $172.5 million; and \n\n \u2022 governmental actions and initiatives, including risks associated with the impact of a prolonged government shutdown or budgetary reductions or impasses, such as a reduction in rental revenues, non-renewal of leases and/or reduced or delayed demand for additional space by our strategic customers; \nThe table below sets forth the segment allocation of our annualized rental revenue of office and data center shell properties as of the end of the last three calendar years: \nOur average outstanding debt was $1.9 billion in 2018 and 2017, and our weighted average effective interest rate on debt was approximately 4.1% in 2018 and 2017.\n (7) Represents contractual obligations pertaining to projects for which we are acting as construction manager on behalf of unrelated parties who are our clients. We expect to be reimbursed in full for these costs by our clients. \nCOPLP's senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by the three major rating agencies. We aim to maintain an investment grade rating to enable COPLP to use debt comprised of unsecured, primarily fixed-rate debt (including the effect of interest rate swaps) from public markets and banks. COPLP also uses secured nonrecourse debt from institutional lenders and banks for joint venture financing. In addition, COPLP periodically raises equity from COPT when COPT accesses the public equity markets by issuing common and/or preferred shares.\nIn making these determinations, we must consider both our and our partner's ability to participate in the management of the entity's operations and make decisions that could significantly affect the entity's performance and allow the parties to manage their economic risks. We need to make subjective estimates and judgments regarding the entity's planned activities and expected future operating performance, financial condition, future valuation and other variables that may affect the cash flows of the entity. We may also need to estimate the probability of different scenarios taking place over time and their effect on the partners' cash flows. The conclusion reached as a result of this process affects whether or not we use the consolidation method in accounting for our investment or the equity method. Whether or not we consolidate an investment can materially affect our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that this leasing activity is reflective of strengthening demand for space in our Defense/IT Locations driven primarily by:\nCOPLP's primary cash requirements are for operating expenses, debt service, development of new properties, improvements to existing properties and acquisitions, to the extent they are pursued in the future. We expect COPLP to continue to use cash flow provided by operations as the primary source to meet its short-term capital needs, including property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, scheduled principal amortization of debt, distributions to its security holders and improvements to existing properties. As of December 31, 2018, COPLP had $8.1 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n \u2022 our ability to borrow on favorable terms; \nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d) is defined as net income computed using GAAP, excluding gains on sales of, and impairment losses on, previously depreciated operating properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization. When multiple properties consisting of both operating and non-operating properties exist on a single tax parcel, we classify all of the gains on sales of, and impairment losses on, the tax parcel as all being for previously depreciated operating properties when most of the value of the parcel is associated with operating properties on the parcel. FFO also includes adjustments to net income for the effects of the items noted above pertaining to UJVs that were allocable to our ownership interest in the UJVs. We believe that we use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) definition of FFO, although others may interpret the definition differently and, accordingly, our presentation of FFO may differ from those of other REITs. We believe that FFO is useful to management and investors as a supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains related to sales of, and impairment losses on, previously depreciated operating properties, net of related tax benefit, and excluding real estate-related depreciation and amortization, FFO can help one compare our operating performance between periods. In addition, since most equity REITs provide FFO information to the investment community, we believe that FFO is useful to investors as a supplemental measure for comparing our results to those of other equity REITs. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO.\nIn addition, the section below entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d includes discussions of, among other things:\n (1) Includes minimum base rents, net of abatements, and lease incentives on a straight-line basis for the years set forth above. \nRefer to 2017 impairment losses described above in our explanation for 2018 losses as compared to 2017.\n (1) The contractual obligations set forth in this table exclude property operations contracts that may be terminated with notice of one month or less and also exclude accruals and payables incurred (with the exclusion of debt) and therefore reflected in our reported liabilities. \nIn determining whether improvements constitute landlord or tenant assets, we consider numerous factors that may require subjective or complex judgments, including: whether the improvements are unique to the tenant or reusable by other tenants; whether the tenant is permitted to alter or remove the improvements without our consent or without compensating us for any lost fair value; whether the ownership of the improvements remains with us or remains with the tenant at the end of the lease term; and whether the economic substance of the lease terms is properly reflected.\n \u25e6 992,000 common shares at a weighted average price of $30.46 per share under its existing at-the-market ( ATM\u201d) stock offering program (the 2016 ATM Program\u201d) for net proceeds of $29.8 million.  COPT contributed the net proceeds from these issuances to COPLP in exchange for an equal number of units in COPLP. The proceeds were used primarily to repay borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility; and\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, our assessment of weakening leasing prospects and expected enduring vacancy in our Aberdeen portfolio indicated that these properties could be impaired. We performed recovery analyses on the properties considering weakening tenant demand, high vacancy and low investor demand for office properties in the submarket and concluded that the carrying values of these properties were not likely to be recovered from the expected undiscounted cash flows from the operation and eventual disposition of these properties. Accordingly, we recognized $9.0 million of impairment losses on the operating properties in Aberdeen (included in our Other segment). In addition, and also considering these conditions, we determined that we would not likely recover the carrying amount of land in this submarket and recognized a $4.7 million impairment loss on it. We previously recognized impairment losses on these properties in the second quarter of 2016 as discussed below. We determined that the declines in values that have occurred since the initial losses were recognized were due to deteriorating market conditions.\nCOPLP is the entity through which COPT, the sole general partner of COPLP, conducts almost all of its operations and owns almost all of its assets. COPT occasionally issues public equity but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company that are fully reimbursed by COPLP. COPT itself does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of COPLP. COPT's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common and preferred shares. COPT's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from COPLP.\nWholesale Data Center\nWe executed property sales of $54.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 (discussed further in Note 5), and had $94.7 million of assets held for sale as of December 31, 2016. As part of our closing process for the fourth quarter, we conducted our quarterly review of our portfolio for indicators of impairment and found there to be no impairment losses for the quarter other than additional impairment losses of $1.3 million on properties previously classified as held for sale in White Marsh, where prospective purchasers reduced offering prices, and $0.3 million of losses on properties that were sold during the period.\nThe table below sets forth components of our interest expense: \n \u2022 possible adverse changes in tax laws; \n \u2022 net repayments of debt borrowings of $3.8 million; \n \u2022 $13.3 million on the operating property in our Northern Virginia Defense/IT sub-segment. Communication with a major tenant in the building during the quarter led us to conclude that there was significant uncertainty with respect to the tenant renewing its lease expiring in 2019. As a result of this information and continuing sub-market weakness, we determined that this property no longer met our long-term hold strategy and we placed it into our asset sales program. Accordingly, we adjusted the carrying amount of the property to its estimated fair value less costs to sell; and \n\nImpairment Losses\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we reclassified: most of our properties in Greater Philadelphia (included in our Regional Office segment); two properties in the Fort Meade/BW Corridor sub-segment; and our remaining land holdings in Colorado Springs, Colorado ( Colorado Springs\u201d) to held for sale and recognized $2.4 million of impairment losses. As of March 31, 2016, we had $225.9 million of assets held for sale.\nGains on sales of real estate decreased due to fewer disposition transactions in 2018 relative to 2017.\nGain on Sales of Real Estate\n(1) Tenant improvement costs incurred on newly-constructed properties are classified in this table as construction, development and redevelopment.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNOI from Service Operations\n \u2022 we ended 2018 with $1.82 billion in debt, which was virtually unchanged from year end 2017. \n (2) Excludes occupancy of vacant square feet acquired or developed. \nAs reflected above, our decrease in Same Properties NOI from real estate operations was due to a 15.7% decrease in our Regional Office segment from 2017 to 2018, offset in part by a 1.5% increase in our Defense/IT Locations from 2017 to 2018. The decrease in the Regional Office segment was due primarily to decreased occupancy in the segment's Northern Virginia submarkets and an increase in operating expenses, net of tenant recovery revenue, in our Baltimore City properties.\nOur average outstanding debt decreased from $2.0 billion in 2016 to $1.9 billion in 2017, and our weighted average effective interest rate on debt was approximately 4.1% in 2017 and 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2018, COPT owned 98.8% of the outstanding common units in COPLP; the remaining common units and all of the outstanding preferred units were owned by third parties. As the sole general partner of COPLP, COPT has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for COPLP's day-to-day management and control.\n \u2022 adverse changes in the real estate markets, including, among other things, increased competition with other companies; \nIn 2018, we also completed 596,000 square feet in leasing of vacant space. The annualized rents of this leasing totaled $23.48 per square foot and the GAAP rents totaled $23.82 per square foot; these leases had a weighted average lease term of approximately 7.4 years and the per annum average estimated tenant improvements and lease costs associated with completing this leasing was approximately $5.72 per square foot.\nDiluted FFO per share is (1) Diluted FFO divided by (2) the sum of the (a) weighted average common shares outstanding during a period, (b) weighted average common units outstanding during a period and (c) weighted average number of potential additional common shares that would have been outstanding during a period if other securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common shares were converted or exchanged. We believe that Diluted FFO per share is useful to investors because it provides investors with a further context for evaluating our FFO results in the same manner that investors use earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) in evaluating net income available to common shareholders. In addition, since most equity REITs provide Diluted FFO per share information to the investment community, we believe that Diluted FFO per share is a useful supplemental measure for comparing us to other equity REITs. We believe that diluted EPS is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Diluted FFO per share. Diluted FFO per share has most of the same limitations as Diluted FFO (described above); management compensates for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for Diluted FFO.\nThe liquidity of COPT is dependent on COPLP's ability to make sufficient distributions to COPT. The primary cash requirement of COPT is its payment of dividends to its shareholders. COPT also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership's debt, as discussed further in Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein. If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill certain of its debt requirements, which trigger COPT's guarantee obligations, then COPT will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. However, COPT's only significant asset is its investment in COPLP.\nLease Expirations\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAccounting Method for Investments\nWe refer to the measure annualized rental revenue\u201d in various sections of the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Annualized rental revenue is a measure that we use to evaluate the source of our rental revenue as of a point in time. It is computed by multiplying by 12 the sum of monthly contractual base rents and estimated monthly expense reimbursements under active leases as of a point in time (ignoring free rent then in effect). Our computation of annualized rental revenue excludes the effect of lease incentives, although the effect of this exclusion is not material. We consider annualized rental revenue to be a useful measure for analyzing revenue sources because, since it is point-in-time based, it does not contain increases and decreases in revenue\n \u2022 our ability to satisfy and operate effectively under Federal income tax rules relating to real estate investment trusts and partnerships; \n\n\n\n (3) We expect to pay these items using cash flow from operations. \n \u2022 exclude, for purposes of amounts reported as of December 31, 2017, a property reported as held for sale that we sold in 2017 subject to our providing a financial guaranty to the buyer under which we indemnified it for up to $20 million in losses it could incur related to a potential defined capital event occurring on the property; our financial guaranty to the buyer expired on October 1, 2018, resulting in no losses to us. Accordingly, we did not recognize the sale of this property for accounting purposes until the expiration of the guaranty on October 1, 2018. \nIn 2018, we completed 4.2 million square feet of leasing, including 1.1 million square feet of construction and redevelopment space. Our construction and redevelopment leasing was highlighted by five data center shells in Northern Virginia totaling 798,000 square feet and an office property in our Northern Virginia Defense/IT sub-segment totaling 159,000 square feet.\nOur Same Properties pool consisted of 134 properties, comprising 82.4% of our office and data center shell portfolio's square footage as of December 31, 2017. This pool of properties changed from the pool used for purposes of comparing 2017 and 2016 in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K due to the addition of two properties with qualifying ground leases reclassified to same office and the removal of one property reclassified as redevelopment.\n \u2022 changes in our plans for properties or views of market economic conditions or failure to obtain development rights, either of which could result in recognition of significant impairment losses; \nIn 2018, we renewed leases on 2.5 million square feet, representing 78.4% of the square footage of our lease expirations (including the effect of early renewals). The annualized rents of these renewals (totaling $31.74 per square foot) decreased on average by approximately 2.0% and the GAAP rents (totaling $32.58 per square foot) increased on average by approximately 6.8% relative to the leases previously in place for the space. The renewed leases had a weighted average lease term of approximately 3.8 years and the per annum average estimated tenant improvements and lease costs associated with completing the leasing was approximately $2.09 per square foot.\n \u2022 $6.2 million on the property in Greater Philadelphia (included in our Regional Office segment) that we reclassified to held for sale during the period and adjusted to fair value less costs to sell; and \nRevenue Recognition on Tenant Improvements\nNOI from Real Estate Operations\nWe had an active year for development activities in 2018, with 688,000 square feet placed in service in six newly-constructed and one redeveloped Defense/IT Location properties, including 514,000 square feet of data center shell space. These properties were 90.3% leased as of December 31, 2018. We also placed into service land that was 100% leased under a long-term contract as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we had ten properties under construction or redevelopment that we estimate will total approximately 1.3 million square feet upon completion, including two partially-operational properties.\nIn addition to owning properties, we provide construction management and other services. The primary manner in which we evaluate the operating performance of our construction management and other service activities is through a measure we define as NOI from service operations, which is based on the net of the revenues and expenses from these activities. The revenues and expenses from these activities consist primarily of subcontracted costs that are reimbursed to us by customers along with a management fee. The operating margins from these activities are small relative to the revenue. We believe NOI\n (8) Represents contractual obligations pertaining to capital expenditures for our operating properties. We expect to pay these costs primarily using cash flow from operating activities. \n\n\nConcentration of Office and Data Center Shell Properties by Segment\n \u2022 net proceeds from the issuance of common shares (or units) of $69.5 million. \nThe table below sets forth components of our interest expense: \nDiluted FFO available to common share and common unit holders ( Diluted FFO\u201d) is Basic FFO adjusted to add back any changes in Basic FFO that would result from the assumed conversion of securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common shares. We believe that Diluted FFO is useful to investors because it is the numerator used to compute Diluted FFO per share, discussed below. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Diluted FFO. Since Diluted FFO excludes certain items includable in the numerator to diluted EPS, reliance on the measure has limitations; management compensates for these limitations by using the measure simply as a supplemental measure that is weighed in the balance with other GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Diluted FFO is not necessarily an indication of our cash flow available to fund cash needs. Additionally, it should not be used as an alternative to net income when evaluating our financial performance or to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities when evaluating our liquidity or ability to make cash distributions or pay debt service.\nThere were no property sales in the second quarter of 2016 and as of June 30, 2016, we had $300.6 million of assets held for sale.\n (1) Includes minimum base rents, net of abatements, and lease incentives on a straight-line basis for the years set forth above. \n \u2022 continually owned and 100% operational throughout the two years being compared, excluding properties held for sale. We define these as changes from Same Properties.\u201d For further discussion of the concept of operational,\u201d refer to the section of Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements entitled Properties\u201d; \nDiluted FFO available to common share and common unit holders, as adjusted for comparability is defined as Diluted FFO adjusted to exclude: operating property acquisition costs; gains on sales of, and impairment losses on, properties other than previously depreciated operating properties, net of associated income tax; gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt; FFO associated with properties securing non-recourse debt on which we have defaulted and which we have extinguished, or expect to extinguish, via conveyance of such properties, including property NOI, interest expense and gains on debt extinguishment (discussed further below); loss on interest rate derivatives; demolition costs on redevelopment and nonrecurring improvements; executive transition costs; and issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred shares. This measure also includes adjustments for the effects of the items noted above pertaining to UJVs that were allocable to our ownership interest in the UJVs. We believe this to be a useful supplemental measure alongside Diluted FFO as it excludes gains and losses from certain investing and financing activities and certain other items that we believe are not closely correlated to (or associated with) our operating performance. The adjustment for FFO associated with properties securing non-recourse debt on which we have defaulted pertains to the periods subsequent to our default on one loan's payment terms, which was the result of our decision to not support payments on the loan since the estimated fair value of the properties was less than the loan balance. While we continued as the legal owner of the properties during this period up until the transfer of ownership, all cash flows produced by them went directly to the lender and we did not fund any debt service shortfalls, which included incremental additional interest under the default rate of $5.3 million in 2015 and $5.8 million in 2014. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to this non-GAAP measure. This measure has essentially the same limitations as Diluted FFO, as well as the further limitation of not reflecting the effects of the excluded items; we compensate for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for Diluted FFO.\nAs discussed further below, we believe that the Operating Partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its Revolving Credit Facility, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to COPT and, in turn, for COPT to make its dividend payments to its shareholders.\nThe tables below set forth occupancy information pertaining to our portfolio of office and data center shell properties:\n \u2022 $2.4 million primarily on land in Colorado Springs and operating properties in White Marsh (included in our Regional Office Segment) classified as held for sale whose carrying amounts exceeded their estimated fair values less costs to sell based on updated negotiations with prospective buyers. \nWe assess each of our properties and related intangible assets for indicators of impairment quarterly or when circumstances indicate that a property may be impaired. We review our plans and intentions for our development projects and land parcels quarterly. If our analyses indicate that the carrying values of operating properties, properties in development or land held for future development may be impaired, we perform a recovery analysis for such properties. For long-lived assets to be held and used, we analyze recoverability based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the operations and eventual disposition of the assets over, in most cases, a ten-year holding period. If we believe there is a significant possibility that we might dispose of the assets earlier, we analyze recoverability using a probability weighted analysis of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the operations and eventual disposition of the assets over the various possible holding periods. If the analysis indicates that the carrying value of a tested property is not recoverable from estimated future cash flows, it is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. If and when our plans change, we revise our recoverability analyses to use the cash flows expected from the operations and eventual disposition of each asset using holding periods that are consistent with our revised plans.\n \u2022 disposed (including a property reported as held for sale since December 31, 2017, the sale of which in 2017 was not recognized for accounting purposes until the expiration of the guaranty on October 1, 2018); and \nFrom a capital perspective in 2018:\nAssessment of Lease Term\n \u2022 COPT issued: \n \u2022 risks of investing through joint venture structures, including risks that our joint venture partners may not fulfill their financial obligations as investors or may take actions that are inconsistent with our objectives; \nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nOur property operating expense included bad debt expense of $339,000 in 2018 and $378,000 in 2017, each representing 0.07% of our revenue from real estate operations for the respective years.\n \u2022 net repayments of debt borrowings of $78.1 million; offset in part by \n \u2022 we had cash outlays of $160.0 million during the year to fund construction, development and redevelopment costs initially funded primarily from borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility; \nThe decrease in occupancy rate from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, in total and for the Fort Meade/BW Corridor sub-segment, was due in large part to the addition in 2018 of unoccupied space in a newly-constructed property targeted for United States Government use that has taken longer than expected to lease. With regard to other segment occupancy trends:\n\nWhen we acquire properties, we allocate the purchase price to numerous tangible and intangible components. Most of the terms in this bullet section are discussed in further detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements entitled Acquisitions of Operating Properties.\u201d Our process for determining the allocation to these components requires many estimates and assumptions, including the following: (1) determination of market rental rates; (2) estimation of leasing and tenant improvement costs associated with the remaining term of acquired leases; (3) assumptions used in determining the in-place lease value, if-vacant value and tenant relationship value, including the rental rates, period of time that it would take to lease vacant space and estimated tenant improvement and leasing costs; (4) renewal probabilities; and (5) allocation of the if-vacant value between land and building. A change in any of the above key assumptions can materially change not only the presentation of acquired properties in our consolidated financial statements but also our reported results of operations. The allocation to different components affects the following:\nWe use measures called payout ratios as supplemental measures of our ability to make distributions to investors based on each of the following: FFO; Diluted FFO; and Diluted FFO, adjusted for comparability. These measures are defined as (1) the sum of (a) dividends on unrestricted common shares and (b) distributions to holders of interests in COPLP and dividends on convertible preferred shares when such distributions and dividends are included in Diluted FFO divided by either (2) FFO, Diluted FFO or Diluted FFO, adjusted for comparability.\nComparison of Statements of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\n \u2022 constructed or redeveloped and placed into service that were not 100% operational throughout the two years being compared; and \nCOPLP uses its Revolving Credit Facility to initially finance much of its investing activities. COPLP subsequently pays down the facility using cash available from operations and proceeds from long-term borrowings, equity issuances and sales of interests in properties. The lenders' aggregate commitment under the facility is $800.0 million, with the ability for COPLP to increase the lenders' aggregate commitment to $1.25 billion, provided that there is no default under the facility and subject to the approval of the lenders. The facility matures in March 2023, and may be extended by two six-month periods at COPLP's option, provided that there is no default under the facility and COPLP pays an extension fee of 0.075% of the total availability under the facility for each extension period. As of December 31, 2018, the maximum borrowing capacity under this facility totaled $800.0 million, of which $587.0 million was available.\nWe undertake no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements.\nCollectability of Accounts and Deferred Rent Receivable\nassociated with periods in which lease terms were not in effect; historical revenue under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) does contain such fluctuations. We find the measure particularly useful for leasing, tenant, segment and industry analysis.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.\n \u2022 risks of real estate acquisition and development activities, including, among other things, risks that development projects may not be completed on schedule, that tenants may not take occupancy or pay rent or that development or operating costs may be greater than anticipated; \nNet cash flow provided by financing activities in 2018 was $49.6 million and included the following:\n \u2022 where the amortization of the components appear over time in our consolidated statements of operations. Allocations to above- and below-market leases are amortized into rental revenue, whereas allocations to most of the other tangible and intangible assets are amortized into depreciation and amortization expense. As a REIT, this is important to us since much of the investment community evaluates our operating performance using non-GAAP measures such as funds from operations, the computation of which includes rental revenue but does not include depreciation and amortization expense; and \nMost of our tenants are obligated to pay their share of a property's operating expenses to the extent such expenses exceed amounts established in their leases, which are based on historical expense levels. Some of our tenants are obligated to pay their full share of a building's operating expenses. These arrangements somewhat reduce our exposure to increases in such costs resulting from inflation.\n\n\nSince FFO excludes certain items includable in net income, reliance on the measure has limitations; management compensates for these limitations by using the measure simply as a supplemental measure that is weighed in balance with other GAAP and non-GAAP measures. FFO is not necessarily an indication of our cash flow available to fund cash needs. Additionally, it should not be used as an alternative to net income when evaluating our financial performance or to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities when evaluating our liquidity or ability to make cash distributions or pay debt service.\nWith regard to our operating portfolio square footage, occupancy and leasing statistics included below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, amounts disclosed:\n \u2022 Other: As of December 31, 2018, our Other segment included two properties totaling 157,000 square feet in Aberdeen, Maryland that we are not expecting to hold long-term. \nCertain of our debt instruments require that we comply with a number of restrictive financial covenants, including maximum leverage ratio, unencumbered leverage ratio, minimum net worth, minimum fixed charge coverage, minimum unencumbered interest coverage ratio, minimum debt service and maximum secured indebtedness ratio. As of December 31, 2018, we were compliant with these covenants.\n \u2022 the dilutive effects of issuing additional common shares; \n \u2022 redemption of preferred shares (or units) of $199.1 million; \n \u2022 $14.1 million on operating properties in our Northern Virginia and Fort Meade/BW Corridor sub-segments that we reclassified to held for sale during the period whose carrying amounts exceeded their estimated fair values less costs to sell; \n \u2022 Regional Office: Includes properties in Baltimore City and two sub-markets in Northern Virginia. While total occupancy in this segment decreased only slightly from year end 2017 to 2018, occupancy decreases in our Northern Virginia submarkets (which were 79.5% occupied as of December 31, 2018) more than offset the effect of an increase in Baltimore City (which was 93.4% occupied as of December 31, 2018). As of December 31, 2018, we had scheduled lease expirations in 2019 for 22,000 square feet, constituting 4% of these Northern Virginia sub-markets' occupied square feet. \n \u2022 payments on a capital lease obligation of $15.4 million; and \nChanges in the expected future cash flows due to changes in our plans for specific properties (especially our expected holding period) could result in the recognition of additional impairment losses. In addition, because properties held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair values less costs to sell, declines in their estimated fair values due to market conditions and other factors could result in the recognition of additional impairment losses.\nProperties held for sale are carried at the lower of their carrying values (i.e., cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment loss recognized, where applicable) or estimated fair values less costs to sell. Accordingly, decisions to sell certain operating properties, properties in development or land held for development will result in impairment losses if carrying values of the specific properties exceed their estimated fair values less costs to sell. The estimates of fair value consider matters such\nOccupancy and Leasing\nThe United States Government's concentration increased each of the last two years due primarily to its occupancy of newly-constructed properties in 2018 and 2017 and our disposition in 2017 of properties in which it was not a tenant.\n \u2022 $4.4 million on land in Aberdeen. In performing our analysis related to the operating properties in Aberdeen, we determined that the weakening leasing and overall commercial real estate conditions in that market indicated that our land holdings in the market may be impaired. As a result, we determined that the carrying amount of the land was not recoverable and adjusted the land to its estimated fair value; \nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we abandoned plans to redevelop a property in our Fort Meade/BW Corridor sub-segment after we completed leasing on the property that did not require any redevelopment. Accordingly, we recognized an impairment loss of $2.4 million representing pre-development costs associated with the property.\nAs reflected above, our decrease in Same Properties NOI from real estate operations was due to a 3.5% increase in our Defense/IT Locations from 2016 to 2017, offset in part by a 5.2% decrease in our Regional Office segment from 2016 to 2017. These changes were due primarily to occupancy changes in the respective segments.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nActivities we conduct to monitor the credit quality of our tenants include the following: monitoring the timeliness of tenant lease payments; reviewing credit ratings of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit agency prior to such tenants' entry into leases, and monitoring periodically thereafter; reviewing financial statements of tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be provided to us pursuant to the terms of such tenants' leases; and monitoring news reports regarding our tenants.\n \u2022 a healthier and more predictable defense spending environment and bipartisan support to fund defense. Clarity regarding defense funding tends to improve the government's process for awarding contracts to prospective tenants, which improves our ability to lease space in Defense/IT Locations properties. We believe that the government's successive increases in defense funding for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 served to bring such clarity relative to prior years and, in turn, fueled much of the growth in demand for office space by the United States Government and its contractors that we observed in 2018. In addition, despite the government starting its fiscal year 2018 under yet another budget Continuing Resolution, the fiscal year: 2018 budget was ultimately signed into law during the year; and 2019 Department of Defense appropriations were \nfrom service operations is a useful measure in assessing both our level of activity and our profitability in conducting such operations.\n \u2022 how we expect to generate cash for short and long-term capital needs; and \n (4) Includes the removal of one property for which we have no leasing plan or intention to allocate future capital and one property reclassified as redevelopment. \nNet cash flow from operating activities decreased $49.6 million from 2017 to 2018 due primarily to our payment in 2018 of construction costs on a contract that the customer pre-funded to us in prior years.\nOffice and Data Center Shell Portfolio\nThis section contains forward-looking\u201d statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that are based on our current expectations, estimates and projections about future events and financial trends affecting the financial condition and operations of our business. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d believe,\u201d anticipate,\u201d expect,\u201d estimate,\u201d plan\u201d or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which we cannot predict with accuracy and some of which we might not even anticipate. Although we believe that the expectations, estimates and projections reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions at the time made, we can give no assurance that these expectations, estimates and projections will be achieved. Future events and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that may affect these expectations, estimates and projections include, but are not limited to:\nNet cash flow used in investing activities increased $143.6 million from 2017 to 2018 due to a $180.8 million decrease in property sales in 2018 relative to 2017, offset in part by a $40.5 million decrease in cash outlays for construction, development and redevelopment.\nThe decrease in general, administrative and leasing expenses from 2016 to 2017 was attributable primarily to $6.5 million of executive transition costs incurred in 2016, representing mostly severance and termination benefits in connection with the departures of former executive officers, compared to $732,000 in such costs recognized in 2017. Capitalized compensation and indirect costs were as follows:\nGeneral, Administrative and Leasing Expenses\n \u2022 Northern Virginia Defense/IT and Navy Support Locations: Occupancy increased due to progress we made in leasing previously vacant space in these sub-segments; \nGain on Sales of Real Estate\n \u2022 dividends and/or distributions to equity holders of $118.0 million; \nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to make certain estimates and assumptions. A summary of our significant accounting policies is provided in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The following section is a summary of certain aspects of those accounting policies involving estimates and assumptions that (1) require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in accounting for uncertain matters or matters that are susceptible to change and (2) materially affect our reported operating performance or financial condition. It is possible that the use of different reasonable estimates or assumptions in making these judgments could result in materially different amounts being reported in our consolidated financial statements. While reviewing this section, refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, including terms defined therein.\n \u2022 the amount of the purchase price allocated among different categories of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets; the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions; and the amount of gain recognized in our consolidated statements of operations should we determine that the fair value of the acquisition exceeds its cost; \nThe table below sets forth the computation of the above stated measures for the years ended December 31, 2014 through 2018 and provides reconciliations to the GAAP measures of COPT and subsidiaries associated with such measures:\nThe increase in capitalized costs for leasing and other from 2017 to 2018 was due to our implementation of an enterprise resource planning software package.\nFor COPT to maintain its qualification as a REIT, it must pay dividends to its shareholders aggregating annually to at least 90% of its ordinary taxable income. As a result of this distribution requirement, it cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that some other companies can. COPT may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund COPLP's working capital needs, development activities and acquisitions.\nAfter ending 2017 with our office and data center shell portfolio 93.6% occupied, our highest year-end occupancy since 2005, we ended 2018 with the portfolio 93.0% occupied. This decrease in occupancy was due primarily to the addition in 2018 of unoccupied space in a newly-constructed property targeted for United States Government use that has taken longer than expected to lease. Our Same Properties (defined below) were 93.0% occupied as of December 31, 2018, an increase from 92.1% as of December 31, 2017, with average occupancy of 91.5% in 2018.\n \u2022 general economic and business conditions, which will, among other things, affect office property and data center demand and rents, tenant creditworthiness, interest rates, financing availability and property values; \nAs discussed further below, the decrease in impairment losses was attributable primarily to impairment losses recognized in our Aberdeen, Maryland ( Aberdeen\u201d) portfolio in 2017.\n \u2022 net proceeds from the issuance of common shares (or units) of $202.1 million; offset in part by \n \u2022 $34.4 million on operating properties in Aberdeen (included in our Other segment). After shortening our estimated holding period for these properties, we determined that the carrying amount of the properties would not likely be recovered from the operation and eventual dispositions of the properties during the shortened holding period. Accordingly, we adjusted the properties to their estimated fair values; \nWe discuss significant factors contributing to changes in our net income over the last three years in the section below entitled Results of Operations.\u201d The results of operations discussion is combined for COPT and COPLP because there are no material differences in the results of operations between the two reporting entities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, COPT had forward equity sale agreements in place with 1.6 million shares available for future issuance with a settlement value of $46.4 million that we expect to use to fund development costs in March 2019.\nNet cash flow used in financing activities in 2017 was $338.5 million and included the following:\nOur 19.25 megawatt wholesale data center had 16.86 megawatts leased as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n \u2022 our commitments and contingencies. \n \u2022 $8.2 million on land in Frederick, Maryland. We determined that the carrying amount of the land would not likely be recovered from its sale and adjusted the land to its estimated fair value; \nThe changes reflected above between year end 2017 and 2018 were attributable primarily to growth in our Data Center Shells sub-segment from newly-constructed properties placed in service and increased occupancy in our Northern Virginia Defense/IT sub-segment. The changes reflected above between year end 2016 and 2017 were attributable primarily to dispositions of Regional Office properties and newly constructed properties placed into service in certain of our Defense/IT Location sub-segments; the Data Center Shells sub-segment's concentration was unchanged between year end 2016 and 2017 because the growth from newly-constructed properties placed in service was offset by the sale of two data center shells that were outside of our core markets.\nAcquisitions of Operating Properties\n \u2022 environmental requirements. \n \u2022 security breaches relating to cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or other factors; and \nAs discussed further below, the decrease in impairment losses was attributable primarily to decisions by us in 2016 to either sell, or abandon plans to develop, properties.\nAllowances for doubtful accounts and deferred rent receivable are established based on quarterly analyses of the risk of loss on specific accounts. The analyses place particular emphasis on past-due accounts and consider information such as the nature and age of the receivables, the payment history of the tenants, the financial condition of the tenants and our assessment of their ability to meet their lease obligations, the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations. Our estimate of the required allowance is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on tenants.\nWe believe that COPLP's liquidity and capital resources are adequate for its near-term and longer-term requirements without necessitating property sales. However, we may dispose of interests in properties opportunistically or when capital markets otherwise warrant.\n (4) Represents interest costs for our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2018 for the terms of such debt. For variable rate debt, the amounts reflected above used December 31, 2018 interest rates on variable rate debt in computing interest costs for the terms of such debt. We expect to pay these items using cash flow from operations. \nDuring our review we also recognized additional impairment losses of $11.5 million on properties previously classified as held for sale. Approximately $10.0 million of these losses pertained to properties in White Marsh due to our assessment that certain significant tenants will likely exercise lease termination rights and to reflect market conditions. The remainder of these losses pertained primarily to properties in San Antonio, Texas (included in our Other segment), where prospective purchasers reduced offering prices late in the third quarter. We executed property sales of $210.7 million in the third quarter of 2016 (discussed further in Note 5), and had $161.5 million of assets held for sale as of September 30, 2016.\nCash Flows\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, as part of our closing process, we conducted our quarterly review of our portfolio for indicators of impairment considering refinements to our disposition strategy made during the third quarter of 2016 to sell an additional operating property in our Northern Virginia Defense/IT sub-segment, an additional operating property in our Fort Meade/BW Corridor sub-segment and our remaining operating properties and land in White Marsh that had not previously been classified as held for sale. In connection with our determinations that we planned to sell these properties, we performed recoverability analyses for each of these properties and recorded the following impairment losses:\n (1) Includes estimated expense reimbursements. The decrease between year end 2016 and 2017 was attributable primarily to lower rents per square foot being in place for our properties placed in service in 2017 relative to the properties we sold since most of the properties we placed into service were data center shells and most of the ones sold were full service office properties. \nDiluted FFO per share, as adjusted for comparability is (1) Diluted FFO, as adjusted for comparability divided by (2) the sum of the (a) weighted average common shares outstanding during a period, (b) weighted average common units outstanding during a period and (c) weighted average number of potential additional common shares that would have been outstanding during a period if other securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common shares were converted or exchanged. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it provides investors with a further context for evaluating our FFO results. We believe this to be a useful supplemental measure alongside Diluted FFO per share as it excludes gains and losses from certain investing and financing activities and certain other items that we believe are not closely correlated to (or associated with) our operating performance. We believe that diluted EPS is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to this per share measure. This measure has most of the same limitations as Diluted FFO (described above) as well as the further limitation of not reflecting the effects of the excluded items; we compensate for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for Diluted FFO.\nIn 2017, we recognized gain on sales of real estate of $5.4 million in connection with land sales and $4.5 million on sales of operating properties. In 2016, we recognized gain on sales of real estate of $17.9 million on our sale of a 50% interest in six single-tenant data center properties, $15.9 million on sales of other operating properties and $7.2 million on land sales.\n\nIn 2018, we completed leasing on 4.2 million square feet, representing only the second time in the Company's history that our annual leasing volume exceeded 4.0 million square feet. This leasing volume was highlighted by a historically:\nConstruction contract and other service revenue and expenses increased due primarily to a greater volume of construction activity in connection with several of our tenants.\nOur NOI from constructed properties placed in service included 17 properties placed in service in 2016 and 2017.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n (6) Due to the long-term nature of certain construction and development contracts and leases included in these lines, the amounts reported in the table represent our estimate of the timing for the related obligations being payable. \n \u2022 continued strong demand for data center shell space. Data center shells have been a significant growth driver for our Defense/IT Locations in recent years. Development leasing of data center shells totaled 798,000 square feet in 2018, 743,000 square feet in 2017 and 728,000 square feet in 2016. All of this leasing pertained to properties in Northern Virginia, one of the largest data center markets in the world, and represented further expansion of our relationship with an existing tenant. ", "item_7_text": "We evaluate the operating performance of our properties using NOI from real estate operations, our segment performance measure, which includes: real estate revenues and property operating expenses; and the net of revenues and property operating expenses of real estate operations owned through unconsolidated real estate joint ventures ( UJVs\u201d) that is allocable to COPT's ownership interest ( UJV NOI allocable to COPT\u201d). We view our NOI from real estate operations as comprising the following primary categories:\nConstruction contract and other service revenue and expenses decreased due primarily to a lower volume of construction activity in connection with several of our tenants. Construction contract activity is inherently subject to significant variability depending on the volume and nature of projects undertaken by us (primarily on behalf of tenants). Service operations are an ancillary component of our overall operations that typically contribute an insignificant amount of income relative to our real estate operations.\n \u2022 the timing over which the items are recognized as revenue or expense in our consolidated statements of operations. For example, for allocations to the as-if vacant value, the land portion is not depreciated and the building portion is depreciated over a longer period of time than the other components (generally 40 years). Allocations to above- and below-market leases, in-place lease value and tenant relationship value are amortized over significantly shorter timeframes, and if individual tenants' leases are terminated early, any unamortized amounts remaining associated with those tenants are written off upon termination. These differences in timing can materially affect our reported results of operations. In addition, we establish lives for tenant relationship values based on our estimates of how long we expect the respective tenants to remain in the properties. \nInflation\nThe table below sets forth as of December 31, 2018 our scheduled lease expirations based on the non-cancelable term of tenant leases determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for our operating properties by segment/sub-segment in terms of percentage of annualized rental revenue: \nOur property operating expense included bad debt expense of $378,000 in 2017 and none in 2016.\nInterest Expense\nBasic FFO available to common share and common unit holders ( Basic FFO\u201d) is FFO adjusted to subtract (1) preferred share dividends, (2) issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred shares, (3) income attributable to noncontrolling interests through ownership of preferred units in the Operating Partnership or interests in other consolidated entities not owned by us, (4) depreciation and amortization allocable to noncontrolling interests in other consolidated entities and (5) Basic FFO allocable to restricted shares. With these adjustments, Basic FFO represents FFO available to common shareholders and common unitholders. Common units in the Operating Partnership are substantially similar to our common shares and are exchangeable into common shares, subject to certain conditions. We believe that Basic FFO is useful to investors due to the close correlation of common units to common shares. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP\nOur Same Properties pool consisted of 147 properties, comprising 89.6% of our office and data center shell portfolio's square footage as of December 31, 2018. This pool of properties included the following changes from the pool used for purposes of comparing 2017 and 2016 in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K: the addition of 14 properties placed in service and 100% operational on or before January 1, 2017 (including six unconsolidated real estate joint venture properties and two properties added to our rentable square feet in 2018 that were previously reported as construction projects since they were held for future lease to the United States Government); and the removal of one property in 2018 for which we have no leasing plan or intention to allocate future capital and one property reclassified as redevelopment.\n (5) Represents contractual obligations pertaining to new development and redevelopment activities. \nProperty Additions\nInterest Expense\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n \u2022 near high volume of development space leasing driven primarily by demand for Data Center Shell space. \nNOI from Service Operations\nYou should refer to our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and our Selected Financial Data table as you read this section.\nFunds from Operations\nThe table below sets forth the major components of our additions to properties for 2018 and 2017:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of COPT\nFor our office and data center shell properties, our weighted average lease term as of December 31, 2018 was approximately 4.9 years. We believe that the weighted average annualized rental revenue per occupied square foot for our office and data center shell property leases expiring in 2019 was, on average, approximately 1% to 3% higher than estimated current market rents for the related space, with specific results varying by segment. Our wholesale data center had scheduled lease expirations in 2020 for 73% of its annualized rental revenue.\nProperty fair values are estimated based on contract prices, indicative bids, discounted cash flow analyses or comparable sales analyses. Estimated cash flows used in such analyses are based on our plans for the property and our views of market and economic conditions. The estimates consider items such as current and future rental rates, occupancies for the tested property and comparable properties, estimated operating and capital expenditures and recent sales data for comparable properties; most of these items are influenced by market data obtained from real estate leasing and brokerage firms and our direct experience with the properties and their markets. Determining the appropriate capitalization or yield rate also requires significant judgment and is typically based on many factors, including the prevailing rate for the market or submarket, as well as the quality and location of the property. Changes in the estimated future cash flows due to changes in our plans for a property (especially our expected holding period), views of market and economic conditions and/or our ability to obtain development rights could result in recognition of impairment losses which could be substantial.\nResults of Operations\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we set a goal to raise cash from sales of properties in 2016 considerably in excess of our assets held for sale at December 31, 2015. The specific properties we would sell to achieve this goal had not been identified when the goal was established. Throughout 2016, we engaged in the process of identifying properties we would sell.\nWe capitalize compensation and indirect costs associated with properties, or portions thereof, undergoing construction, development and redevelopment activities. We also capitalize compensation costs associated with obtaining new tenant leases or extending existing tenants. Capitalized compensation and indirect costs were as follows:\nGeneral, Administrative and Leasing Expenses\nNOI from Real Estate Operations \nas recent sales data for comparable properties and, where applicable, contracts or the results of negotiations with prospective purchasers. These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions, and our assessment of such conditions, change.\nenacted in September 2018, representing the first time in ten years that the department received its annual appropriations on time. These budgets included increased funding levels for the Department of Defense's discretionary base budget authority of 14% from fiscal year 2017 to 2018 and 2% from fiscal year 2018 to 2019; and\nAs discussed above, a significant portion of our portfolio is leased to the United States Government, and the majority of those leases consist of a series of one-year renewal options, or provide for early termination rights. In addition, certain other leases in our portfolio provide early termination rights to tenants. Applicable accounting guidance requires us to recognize minimum rental payments on a straight-line basis over the terms of each lease and to assess the lease terms as including all periods for which failure to renew, or continue, the lease imposes a penalty on the lessee in such amounts that renewal, or continuation, appears, at the inception of the lease, to be reasonably assured. Factors we consider when determining whether a penalty is significant include the uniqueness of the purpose or location of the property, the availability of a comparable replacement property, the relative importance or significance of the property to the continuation of the lessee's line of business and the existence of leasehold improvements or other assets whose value would be impaired by the lessee vacating or discontinuing use of the leased property. For virtually all of our leases with the United States Government, we have concluded, based on the factors above, that exercise of existing renewal options, or continuation of such leases without exercising early termination rights, is reasonably assured. Changes in these assessments could result in the write-off of any recorded assets associated with straight-line rental revenue and acceleration of depreciation and amortization expense associated with costs we incurred related to these leases.\nThe computations for all of the above measures on a diluted basis assume the conversion of common units in COPLP but do not assume the conversion of other securities that are convertible into common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase per share measures in a given period.\nIn November 2018, COPT replaced its 2016 ATM Program with a new program under which it may offer and sell common shares in at-the-market stock offerings having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $300 million (the 2018 ATM Program\u201d). Under the 2018 ATM Program, COPT may also, at its discretion, sell common shares under forward equity sales agreements. The use of a forward equity sales agreement would enable us to lock in a price on a sale of common shares when the agreement is executed but defer receiving the proceeds from the sale until a later date.\n (3) Includes the addition of 330,000 square feet in two properties that were completed in 2016 but reported as construction projects through December 31, 2017 since they were held for future lease to the United States Government. These square feet were 48.5% occupied as of December 31, 2018 and unoccupied as of December 31, 2017. \nChanges in the expected future cash flows due to changes in our plans for specific properties (especially our expected holding period) could result in the recognition of additional impairment losses. In addition, because properties held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair values less costs to sell, declines in their estimated fair values due to market conditions and other factors could result in the recognition of additional impairment losses.\n\nWe had no material off-balance sheet arrangements during 2018.\nWhile net operating income ( NOI\u201d) from real estate operations, our segment performance measure discussed further below, decreased by approximately $3 million from 2017 to 2018 in total and for our Same Properties, these results varied significantly between our segments. Most notably, and as discussed further in the section below entitled Results of Operations,\u201d our Same Properties NOI from real estate operations increased $3.7 million for our Defense/IT Locations properties but decreased $5.7 million for our Regional Office properties. Our net income increased $3.7 million from 2017 to 2018, which included: a $12.8 million decrease in impairment losses; offset in part by a $7.6 million decrease in gain on sales of real estate.\nMost of the leases with our largest tenant, the United States Government, provide for consecutive one-year terms with automatic renewals; most of the leasing statistics set forth above assume that the United States Government will remain in the space that they lease through the end of the respective arrangements without ending consecutive one-year leases prematurely.\n \u2022 high volume of square feet renewed, which contributed to a tenant retention rate of 78.4% for the year (defined below in the section entitled Occupancy and Leasing\u201d); and \nComparison of Statements of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n \u2022 $2.9 million on the other properties that we reclassified as held for sale, primarily associated with a land parcel in White Marsh. As of June 30, 2016, this land was under a sales contract subject to a re-zoning contingency. During the third quarter, we were denied favorable re-zoning and the contract was canceled. As a result, we determined this property will be sold as is, reclassified it to held for sale and adjusted its carrying value to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. \n \u2022 office and data center shell properties: \nDuring the second quarter of 2016, as part of our closing process, we conducted our quarterly review of our portfolio for indicators of impairment considering the refined investment strategy of our then newly-appointed Chief Executive Officer and the goals of the asset sales program and concluded that we would: (1) not hold our operating properties in Aberdeen for the long-term; (2) not develop commercial properties on land in Frederick, Maryland; (3) sell specific properties in our Northern Virginia Defense/IT and Fort Meade/BW Corridor sub-segments; and (4) sell the remaining operating property in Greater Philadelphia that had not previously been classified as held for sale. Accordingly, we performed recoverability analyses for each of these properties and recorded the following impairment losses:\n \u2022 exclude, for purposes of amounts reported as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the unoccupied portion of two newly-constructed properties that were completed but reported as construction projects since they were held for future lease to the United States Government. Effective in 2018, these properties were fully included in our operating property statistics; and \nCustomer Concentration of Property Operations\n (1) Includes lease terminations and space reductions occurring in connection with lease renewals. \nImpairment Losses\n \u2022 include total information pertaining to six properties owned through an unconsolidated real estate joint venture except for amounts reported for annualized rental revenue, which represent the portion attributable to our ownership interest; \nDuring 2017, we performed recoverability analyses for our properties classified as held for sale, which resulted in impairment losses of $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2017. These impairment losses were primarily on properties in White Marsh, Maryland ( White Marsh\u201d) (included in our Regional Office and Other segments) that we reclassified to held for sale during the period and adjusted to fair value less costs to sell. These properties were sold in the third quarter of 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of COPLP\nSince both of the measures discussed above exclude certain items includable in net income, reliance on these measures has limitations; management compensates for these limitations by using the measures simply as supplemental measures that are considered alongside other GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of NOI from real estate operations and NOI from service operations to net income reported on the consolidated statements of operations of COPT and subsidiaries is provided in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\n \u2022 dividends and/or distributions to equity holders of $122.9 million; and \nCOPT's short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for future dividends expected to be paid to its shareholders. COPT periodically accesses the public equity markets to raise capital by issuing common and/or preferred shares.\n \u2022 our wholesale data center. \nWe expect to spend $250 million to $300 million on construction and development costs and approximately $65 million on improvements and leasing costs for operating properties (including the commitments set forth in the table above) in 2019. We expect to fund the construction and development costs initially using primarily borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and proceeds from common shares issued under COPT's forward equity sale agreements. We expect to fund improvements to existing operating properties using cash flow from operating activities.\n (2) Represents scheduled principal amortization payments and maturities only and therefore excludes net debt discounts and deferred financing costs of $14.6 million. As of December 31, 2018, maturities included $213.0 million in 2023 that may be extended to 2024, subject to certain conditions. \n \u2022 our ability to achieve projected results; \nOur NOI from constructed and redeveloped properties placed in service included 16 properties and land under a long-term contract placed in service in 2017 and 2018.\nmeasure to Basic FFO. Basic FFO has essentially the same limitations as FFO; management compensates for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for FFO.\nWe use three different accounting methods to report our investments in entities: the consolidation method; the equity method; or at fair value through net income (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). We use the consolidation method when we own most of the outstanding voting interests in an entity and can control its operations. We also consolidate certain entities when control of such entities can be achieved through means other than voting rights ( variable interest entities\u201d or VIEs\u201d) if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Generally, this applies to entities for which either: (1) the equity investors (if any) lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest; (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support; or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest. We use the equity method of accounting when we own an interest in an entity and can exert significant influence over, but cannot control, the entity's operations. We use the fair value method of accounting when we own an equity interest in an entity and cannot exert significant influence over its operations.\nConcentration of Operations\nMost of our leases involve some form of improvements to leased space. When we are required to provide improvements under the terms of a lease, we need to determine whether the improvements constitute landlord assets or tenant assets. If the improvements are landlord assets, we capitalize the cost of the improvements and recognize depreciation expense associated with such improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or the term of the lease and recognize any payments from the tenant as rental revenue over the term of the lease. If the improvements are tenant assets, we defer the cost of improvements funded by us as a lease incentive asset and amortize it as a reduction of rental revenue over the term of the lease. Our determination of whether improvements are landlord assets or tenant assets also may affect when we commence revenue recognition in connection with a lease.\nThe table below sets forth the 20 largest tenants in our portfolio of operating properties (including our office and data center shell properties and wholesale data center) based on percentage of annualized rental revenue:\nOverview\n \u25e6 5.9 million common shares under forward equity sale agreements originated in 2017 for net proceeds of $172.5 million; and \n\n \u2022 governmental actions and initiatives, including risks associated with the impact of a prolonged government shutdown or budgetary reductions or impasses, such as a reduction in rental revenues, non-renewal of leases and/or reduced or delayed demand for additional space by our strategic customers; \nThe table below sets forth the segment allocation of our annualized rental revenue of office and data center shell properties as of the end of the last three calendar years: \nOur average outstanding debt was $1.9 billion in 2018 and 2017, and our weighted average effective interest rate on debt was approximately 4.1% in 2018 and 2017.\n (7) Represents contractual obligations pertaining to projects for which we are acting as construction manager on behalf of unrelated parties who are our clients. We expect to be reimbursed in full for these costs by our clients. \nCOPLP's senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by the three major rating agencies. We aim to maintain an investment grade rating to enable COPLP to use debt comprised of unsecured, primarily fixed-rate debt (including the effect of interest rate swaps) from public markets and banks. COPLP also uses secured nonrecourse debt from institutional lenders and banks for joint venture financing. In addition, COPLP periodically raises equity from COPT when COPT accesses the public equity markets by issuing common and/or preferred shares.\nIn making these determinations, we must consider both our and our partner's ability to participate in the management of the entity's operations and make decisions that could significantly affect the entity's performance and allow the parties to manage their economic risks. We need to make subjective estimates and judgments regarding the entity's planned activities and expected future operating performance, financial condition, future valuation and other variables that may affect the cash flows of the entity. We may also need to estimate the probability of different scenarios taking place over time and their effect on the partners' cash flows. The conclusion reached as a result of this process affects whether or not we use the consolidation method in accounting for our investment or the equity method. Whether or not we consolidate an investment can materially affect our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that this leasing activity is reflective of strengthening demand for space in our Defense/IT Locations driven primarily by:\nCOPLP's primary cash requirements are for operating expenses, debt service, development of new properties, improvements to existing properties and acquisitions, to the extent they are pursued in the future. We expect COPLP to continue to use cash flow provided by operations as the primary source to meet its short-term capital needs, including property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, scheduled principal amortization of debt, distributions to its security holders and improvements to existing properties. As of December 31, 2018, COPLP had $8.1 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n \u2022 our ability to borrow on favorable terms; \nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d) is defined as net income computed using GAAP, excluding gains on sales of, and impairment losses on, previously depreciated operating properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization. When multiple properties consisting of both operating and non-operating properties exist on a single tax parcel, we classify all of the gains on sales of, and impairment losses on, the tax parcel as all being for previously depreciated operating properties when most of the value of the parcel is associated with operating properties on the parcel. FFO also includes adjustments to net income for the effects of the items noted above pertaining to UJVs that were allocable to our ownership interest in the UJVs. We believe that we use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) definition of FFO, although others may interpret the definition differently and, accordingly, our presentation of FFO may differ from those of other REITs. We believe that FFO is useful to management and investors as a supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains related to sales of, and impairment losses on, previously depreciated operating properties, net of related tax benefit, and excluding real estate-related depreciation and amortization, FFO can help one compare our operating performance between periods. In addition, since most equity REITs provide FFO information to the investment community, we believe that FFO is useful to investors as a supplemental measure for comparing our results to those of other equity REITs. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO.\nIn addition, the section below entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d includes discussions of, among other things:\n (1) Includes minimum base rents, net of abatements, and lease incentives on a straight-line basis for the years set forth above. \nRefer to 2017 impairment losses described above in our explanation for 2018 losses as compared to 2017.\n (1) The contractual obligations set forth in this table exclude property operations contracts that may be terminated with notice of one month or less and also exclude accruals and payables incurred (with the exclusion of debt) and therefore reflected in our reported liabilities. \nIn determining whether improvements constitute landlord or tenant assets, we consider numerous factors that may require subjective or complex judgments, including: whether the improvements are unique to the tenant or reusable by other tenants; whether the tenant is permitted to alter or remove the improvements without our consent or without compensating us for any lost fair value; whether the ownership of the improvements remains with us or remains with the tenant at the end of the lease term; and whether the economic substance of the lease terms is properly reflected.\n \u25e6 992,000 common shares at a weighted average price of $30.46 per share under its existing at-the-market ( ATM\u201d) stock offering program (the 2016 ATM Program\u201d) for net proceeds of $29.8 million.  COPT contributed the net proceeds from these issuances to COPLP in exchange for an equal number of units in COPLP. The proceeds were used primarily to repay borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility; and\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, our assessment of weakening leasing prospects and expected enduring vacancy in our Aberdeen portfolio indicated that these properties could be impaired. We performed recovery analyses on the properties considering weakening tenant demand, high vacancy and low investor demand for office properties in the submarket and concluded that the carrying values of these properties were not likely to be recovered from the expected undiscounted cash flows from the operation and eventual disposition of these properties. Accordingly, we recognized $9.0 million of impairment losses on the operating properties in Aberdeen (included in our Other segment). In addition, and also considering these conditions, we determined that we would not likely recover the carrying amount of land in this submarket and recognized a $4.7 million impairment loss on it. We previously recognized impairment losses on these properties in the second quarter of 2016 as discussed below. We determined that the declines in values that have occurred since the initial losses were recognized were due to deteriorating market conditions.\nCOPLP is the entity through which COPT, the sole general partner of COPLP, conducts almost all of its operations and owns almost all of its assets. COPT occasionally issues public equity but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company that are fully reimbursed by COPLP. COPT itself does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of COPLP. COPT's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common and preferred shares. COPT's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from COPLP.\nWholesale Data Center\nWe executed property sales of $54.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 (discussed further in Note 5), and had $94.7 million of assets held for sale as of December 31, 2016. As part of our closing process for the fourth quarter, we conducted our quarterly review of our portfolio for indicators of impairment and found there to be no impairment losses for the quarter other than additional impairment losses of $1.3 million on properties previously classified as held for sale in White Marsh, where prospective purchasers reduced offering prices, and $0.3 million of losses on properties that were sold during the period.\nThe table below sets forth components of our interest expense: \n \u2022 possible adverse changes in tax laws; \n \u2022 net repayments of debt borrowings of $3.8 million; \n \u2022 $13.3 million on the operating property in our Northern Virginia Defense/IT sub-segment. Communication with a major tenant in the building during the quarter led us to conclude that there was significant uncertainty with respect to the tenant renewing its lease expiring in 2019. As a result of this information and continuing sub-market weakness, we determined that this property no longer met our long-term hold strategy and we placed it into our asset sales program. Accordingly, we adjusted the carrying amount of the property to its estimated fair value less costs to sell; and \n\nImpairment Losses\nIn the first quarter of 2016, we reclassified: most of our properties in Greater Philadelphia (included in our Regional Office segment); two properties in the Fort Meade/BW Corridor sub-segment; and our remaining land holdings in Colorado Springs, Colorado ( Colorado Springs\u201d) to held for sale and recognized $2.4 million of impairment losses. As of March 31, 2016, we had $225.9 million of assets held for sale.\nGains on sales of real estate decreased due to fewer disposition transactions in 2018 relative to 2017.\nGain on Sales of Real Estate\n(1) Tenant improvement costs incurred on newly-constructed properties are classified in this table as construction, development and redevelopment.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNOI from Service Operations\n \u2022 we ended 2018 with $1.82 billion in debt, which was virtually unchanged from year end 2017. \n (2) Excludes occupancy of vacant square feet acquired or developed. \nAs reflected above, our decrease in Same Properties NOI from real estate operations was due to a 15.7% decrease in our Regional Office segment from 2017 to 2018, offset in part by a 1.5% increase in our Defense/IT Locations from 2017 to 2018. The decrease in the Regional Office segment was due primarily to decreased occupancy in the segment's Northern Virginia submarkets and an increase in operating expenses, net of tenant recovery revenue, in our Baltimore City properties.\nOur average outstanding debt decreased from $2.0 billion in 2016 to $1.9 billion in 2017, and our weighted average effective interest rate on debt was approximately 4.1% in 2017 and 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2018, COPT owned 98.8% of the outstanding common units in COPLP; the remaining common units and all of the outstanding preferred units were owned by third parties. As the sole general partner of COPLP, COPT has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for COPLP's day-to-day management and control.\n \u2022 adverse changes in the real estate markets, including, among other things, increased competition with other companies; \nIn 2018, we also completed 596,000 square feet in leasing of vacant space. The annualized rents of this leasing totaled $23.48 per square foot and the GAAP rents totaled $23.82 per square foot; these leases had a weighted average lease term of approximately 7.4 years and the per annum average estimated tenant improvements and lease costs associated with completing this leasing was approximately $5.72 per square foot.\nDiluted FFO per share is (1) Diluted FFO divided by (2) the sum of the (a) weighted average common shares outstanding during a period, (b) weighted average common units outstanding during a period and (c) weighted average number of potential additional common shares that would have been outstanding during a period if other securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common shares were converted or exchanged. We believe that Diluted FFO per share is useful to investors because it provides investors with a further context for evaluating our FFO results in the same manner that investors use earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) in evaluating net income available to common shareholders. In addition, since most equity REITs provide Diluted FFO per share information to the investment community, we believe that Diluted FFO per share is a useful supplemental measure for comparing us to other equity REITs. We believe that diluted EPS is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Diluted FFO per share. Diluted FFO per share has most of the same limitations as Diluted FFO (described above); management compensates for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for Diluted FFO.\nThe liquidity of COPT is dependent on COPLP's ability to make sufficient distributions to COPT. The primary cash requirement of COPT is its payment of dividends to its shareholders. COPT also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership's debt, as discussed further in Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein. If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill certain of its debt requirements, which trigger COPT's guarantee obligations, then COPT will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. However, COPT's only significant asset is its investment in COPLP.\nLease Expirations\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nAccounting Method for Investments\nWe refer to the measure annualized rental revenue\u201d in various sections of the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Annualized rental revenue is a measure that we use to evaluate the source of our rental revenue as of a point in time. It is computed by multiplying by 12 the sum of monthly contractual base rents and estimated monthly expense reimbursements under active leases as of a point in time (ignoring free rent then in effect). Our computation of annualized rental revenue excludes the effect of lease incentives, although the effect of this exclusion is not material. We consider annualized rental revenue to be a useful measure for analyzing revenue sources because, since it is point-in-time based, it does not contain increases and decreases in revenue\n \u2022 our ability to satisfy and operate effectively under Federal income tax rules relating to real estate investment trusts and partnerships; \n\n\n\n (3) We expect to pay these items using cash flow from operations. \n \u2022 exclude, for purposes of amounts reported as of December 31, 2017, a property reported as held for sale that we sold in 2017 subject to our providing a financial guaranty to the buyer under which we indemnified it for up to $20 million in losses it could incur related to a potential defined capital event occurring on the property; our financial guaranty to the buyer expired on October 1, 2018, resulting in no losses to us. Accordingly, we did not recognize the sale of this property for accounting purposes until the expiration of the guaranty on October 1, 2018. \nIn 2018, we completed 4.2 million square feet of leasing, including 1.1 million square feet of construction and redevelopment space. Our construction and redevelopment leasing was highlighted by five data center shells in Northern Virginia totaling 798,000 square feet and an office property in our Northern Virginia Defense/IT sub-segment totaling 159,000 square feet.\nOur Same Properties pool consisted of 134 properties, comprising 82.4% of our office and data center shell portfolio's square footage as of December 31, 2017. This pool of properties changed from the pool used for purposes of comparing 2017 and 2016 in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K due to the addition of two properties with qualifying ground leases reclassified to same office and the removal of one property reclassified as redevelopment.\n \u2022 changes in our plans for properties or views of market economic conditions or failure to obtain development rights, either of which could result in recognition of significant impairment losses; \nIn 2018, we renewed leases on 2.5 million square feet, representing 78.4% of the square footage of our lease expirations (including the effect of early renewals). The annualized rents of these renewals (totaling $31.74 per square foot) decreased on average by approximately 2.0% and the GAAP rents (totaling $32.58 per square foot) increased on average by approximately 6.8% relative to the leases previously in place for the space. The renewed leases had a weighted average lease term of approximately 3.8 years and the per annum average estimated tenant improvements and lease costs associated with completing the leasing was approximately $2.09 per square foot.\n \u2022 $6.2 million on the property in Greater Philadelphia (included in our Regional Office segment) that we reclassified to held for sale during the period and adjusted to fair value less costs to sell; and \nRevenue Recognition on Tenant Improvements\nNOI from Real Estate Operations\nWe had an active year for development activities in 2018, with 688,000 square feet placed in service in six newly-constructed and one redeveloped Defense/IT Location properties, including 514,000 square feet of data center shell space. These properties were 90.3% leased as of December 31, 2018. We also placed into service land that was 100% leased under a long-term contract as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we had ten properties under construction or redevelopment that we estimate will total approximately 1.3 million square feet upon completion, including two partially-operational properties.\nIn addition to owning properties, we provide construction management and other services. The primary manner in which we evaluate the operating performance of our construction management and other service activities is through a measure we define as NOI from service operations, which is based on the net of the revenues and expenses from these activities. The revenues and expenses from these activities consist primarily of subcontracted costs that are reimbursed to us by customers along with a management fee. The operating margins from these activities are small relative to the revenue. We believe NOI\n (8) Represents contractual obligations pertaining to capital expenditures for our operating properties. We expect to pay these costs primarily using cash flow from operating activities. \n\n\nConcentration of Office and Data Center Shell Properties by Segment\n \u2022 net proceeds from the issuance of common shares (or units) of $69.5 million. \nThe table below sets forth components of our interest expense: \nDiluted FFO available to common share and common unit holders ( Diluted FFO\u201d) is Basic FFO adjusted to add back any changes in Basic FFO that would result from the assumed conversion of securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common shares. We believe that Diluted FFO is useful to investors because it is the numerator used to compute Diluted FFO per share, discussed below. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Diluted FFO. Since Diluted FFO excludes certain items includable in the numerator to diluted EPS, reliance on the measure has limitations; management compensates for these limitations by using the measure simply as a supplemental measure that is weighed in the balance with other GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Diluted FFO is not necessarily an indication of our cash flow available to fund cash needs. Additionally, it should not be used as an alternative to net income when evaluating our financial performance or to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities when evaluating our liquidity or ability to make cash distributions or pay debt service.\nThere were no property sales in the second quarter of 2016 and as of June 30, 2016, we had $300.6 million of assets held for sale.\n (1) Includes minimum base rents, net of abatements, and lease incentives on a straight-line basis for the years set forth above. \n \u2022 continually owned and 100% operational throughout the two years being compared, excluding properties held for sale. We define these as changes from Same Properties.\u201d For further discussion of the concept of operational,\u201d refer to the section of Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements entitled Properties\u201d; \nDiluted FFO available to common share and common unit holders, as adjusted for comparability is defined as Diluted FFO adjusted to exclude: operating property acquisition costs; gains on sales of, and impairment losses on, properties other than previously depreciated operating properties, net of associated income tax; gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt; FFO associated with properties securing non-recourse debt on which we have defaulted and which we have extinguished, or expect to extinguish, via conveyance of such properties, including property NOI, interest expense and gains on debt extinguishment (discussed further below); loss on interest rate derivatives; demolition costs on redevelopment and nonrecurring improvements; executive transition costs; and issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred shares. This measure also includes adjustments for the effects of the items noted above pertaining to UJVs that were allocable to our ownership interest in the UJVs. We believe this to be a useful supplemental measure alongside Diluted FFO as it excludes gains and losses from certain investing and financing activities and certain other items that we believe are not closely correlated to (or associated with) our operating performance. The adjustment for FFO associated with properties securing non-recourse debt on which we have defaulted pertains to the periods subsequent to our default on one loan's payment terms, which was the result of our decision to not support payments on the loan since the estimated fair value of the properties was less than the loan balance. While we continued as the legal owner of the properties during this period up until the transfer of ownership, all cash flows produced by them went directly to the lender and we did not fund any debt service shortfalls, which included incremental additional interest under the default rate of $5.3 million in 2015 and $5.8 million in 2014. We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to this non-GAAP measure. This measure has essentially the same limitations as Diluted FFO, as well as the further limitation of not reflecting the effects of the excluded items; we compensate for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for Diluted FFO.\nAs discussed further below, we believe that the Operating Partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its Revolving Credit Facility, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to COPT and, in turn, for COPT to make its dividend payments to its shareholders.\nThe tables below set forth occupancy information pertaining to our portfolio of office and data center shell properties:\n \u2022 $2.4 million primarily on land in Colorado Springs and operating properties in White Marsh (included in our Regional Office Segment) classified as held for sale whose carrying amounts exceeded their estimated fair values less costs to sell based on updated negotiations with prospective buyers. \nWe assess each of our properties and related intangible assets for indicators of impairment quarterly or when circumstances indicate that a property may be impaired. We review our plans and intentions for our development projects and land parcels quarterly. If our analyses indicate that the carrying values of operating properties, properties in development or land held for future development may be impaired, we perform a recovery analysis for such properties. For long-lived assets to be held and used, we analyze recoverability based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the operations and eventual disposition of the assets over, in most cases, a ten-year holding period. If we believe there is a significant possibility that we might dispose of the assets earlier, we analyze recoverability using a probability weighted analysis of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the operations and eventual disposition of the assets over the various possible holding periods. If the analysis indicates that the carrying value of a tested property is not recoverable from estimated future cash flows, it is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. If and when our plans change, we revise our recoverability analyses to use the cash flows expected from the operations and eventual disposition of each asset using holding periods that are consistent with our revised plans.\n \u2022 disposed (including a property reported as held for sale since December 31, 2017, the sale of which in 2017 was not recognized for accounting purposes until the expiration of the guaranty on October 1, 2018); and \nFrom a capital perspective in 2018:\nAssessment of Lease Term\n \u2022 COPT issued: \n \u2022 risks of investing through joint venture structures, including risks that our joint venture partners may not fulfill their financial obligations as investors or may take actions that are inconsistent with our objectives; \nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nOur property operating expense included bad debt expense of $339,000 in 2018 and $378,000 in 2017, each representing 0.07% of our revenue from real estate operations for the respective years.\n \u2022 net repayments of debt borrowings of $78.1 million; offset in part by \n \u2022 we had cash outlays of $160.0 million during the year to fund construction, development and redevelopment costs initially funded primarily from borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility; \nThe decrease in occupancy rate from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, in total and for the Fort Meade/BW Corridor sub-segment, was due in large part to the addition in 2018 of unoccupied space in a newly-constructed property targeted for United States Government use that has taken longer than expected to lease. With regard to other segment occupancy trends:\n\nWhen we acquire properties, we allocate the purchase price to numerous tangible and intangible components. Most of the terms in this bullet section are discussed in further detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements entitled Acquisitions of Operating Properties.\u201d Our process for determining the allocation to these components requires many estimates and assumptions, including the following: (1) determination of market rental rates; (2) estimation of leasing and tenant improvement costs associated with the remaining term of acquired leases; (3) assumptions used in determining the in-place lease value, if-vacant value and tenant relationship value, including the rental rates, period of time that it would take to lease vacant space and estimated tenant improvement and leasing costs; (4) renewal probabilities; and (5) allocation of the if-vacant value between land and building. A change in any of the above key assumptions can materially change not only the presentation of acquired properties in our consolidated financial statements but also our reported results of operations. The allocation to different components affects the following:\nWe use measures called payout ratios as supplemental measures of our ability to make distributions to investors based on each of the following: FFO; Diluted FFO; and Diluted FFO, adjusted for comparability. These measures are defined as (1) the sum of (a) dividends on unrestricted common shares and (b) distributions to holders of interests in COPLP and dividends on convertible preferred shares when such distributions and dividends are included in Diluted FFO divided by either (2) FFO, Diluted FFO or Diluted FFO, adjusted for comparability.\nComparison of Statements of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\n \u2022 constructed or redeveloped and placed into service that were not 100% operational throughout the two years being compared; and \nCOPLP uses its Revolving Credit Facility to initially finance much of its investing activities. COPLP subsequently pays down the facility using cash available from operations and proceeds from long-term borrowings, equity issuances and sales of interests in properties. The lenders' aggregate commitment under the facility is $800.0 million, with the ability for COPLP to increase the lenders' aggregate commitment to $1.25 billion, provided that there is no default under the facility and subject to the approval of the lenders. The facility matures in March 2023, and may be extended by two six-month periods at COPLP's option, provided that there is no default under the facility and COPLP pays an extension fee of 0.075% of the total availability under the facility for each extension period. As of December 31, 2018, the maximum borrowing capacity under this facility totaled $800.0 million, of which $587.0 million was available.\nWe undertake no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements.\nCollectability of Accounts and Deferred Rent Receivable\nassociated with periods in which lease terms were not in effect; historical revenue under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) does contain such fluctuations. We find the measure particularly useful for leasing, tenant, segment and industry analysis.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.\n \u2022 risks of real estate acquisition and development activities, including, among other things, risks that development projects may not be completed on schedule, that tenants may not take occupancy or pay rent or that development or operating costs may be greater than anticipated; \nNet cash flow provided by financing activities in 2018 was $49.6 million and included the following:\n \u2022 where the amortization of the components appear over time in our consolidated statements of operations. Allocations to above- and below-market leases are amortized into rental revenue, whereas allocations to most of the other tangible and intangible assets are amortized into depreciation and amortization expense. As a REIT, this is important to us since much of the investment community evaluates our operating performance using non-GAAP measures such as funds from operations, the computation of which includes rental revenue but does not include depreciation and amortization expense; and \nMost of our tenants are obligated to pay their share of a property's operating expenses to the extent such expenses exceed amounts established in their leases, which are based on historical expense levels. Some of our tenants are obligated to pay their full share of a building's operating expenses. These arrangements somewhat reduce our exposure to increases in such costs resulting from inflation.\n\n\nSince FFO excludes certain items includable in net income, reliance on the measure has limitations; management compensates for these limitations by using the measure simply as a supplemental measure that is weighed in balance with other GAAP and non-GAAP measures. FFO is not necessarily an indication of our cash flow available to fund cash needs. Additionally, it should not be used as an alternative to net income when evaluating our financial performance or to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities when evaluating our liquidity or ability to make cash distributions or pay debt service.\nWith regard to our operating portfolio square footage, occupancy and leasing statistics included below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, amounts disclosed:\n \u2022 Other: As of December 31, 2018, our Other segment included two properties totaling 157,000 square feet in Aberdeen, Maryland that we are not expecting to hold long-term. \nCertain of our debt instruments require that we comply with a number of restrictive financial covenants, including maximum leverage ratio, unencumbered leverage ratio, minimum net worth, minimum fixed charge coverage, minimum unencumbered interest coverage ratio, minimum debt service and maximum secured indebtedness ratio. As of December 31, 2018, we were compliant with these covenants.\n \u2022 the dilutive effects of issuing additional common shares; \n \u2022 redemption of preferred shares (or units) of $199.1 million; \n \u2022 $14.1 million on operating properties in our Northern Virginia and Fort Meade/BW Corridor sub-segments that we reclassified to held for sale during the period whose carrying amounts exceeded their estimated fair values less costs to sell; \n \u2022 Regional Office: Includes properties in Baltimore City and two sub-markets in Northern Virginia. While total occupancy in this segment decreased only slightly from year end 2017 to 2018, occupancy decreases in our Northern Virginia submarkets (which were 79.5% occupied as of December 31, 2018) more than offset the effect of an increase in Baltimore City (which was 93.4% occupied as of December 31, 2018). As of December 31, 2018, we had scheduled lease expirations in 2019 for 22,000 square feet, constituting 4% of these Northern Virginia sub-markets' occupied square feet. \n \u2022 payments on a capital lease obligation of $15.4 million; and \nChanges in the expected future cash flows due to changes in our plans for specific properties (especially our expected holding period) could result in the recognition of additional impairment losses. In addition, because properties held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair values less costs to sell, declines in their estimated fair values due to market conditions and other factors could result in the recognition of additional impairment losses.\nProperties held for sale are carried at the lower of their carrying values (i.e., cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment loss recognized, where applicable) or estimated fair values less costs to sell. Accordingly, decisions to sell certain operating properties, properties in development or land held for development will result in impairment losses if carrying values of the specific properties exceed their estimated fair values less costs to sell. The estimates of fair value consider matters such\nOccupancy and Leasing\nThe United States Government's concentration increased each of the last two years due primarily to its occupancy of newly-constructed properties in 2018 and 2017 and our disposition in 2017 of properties in which it was not a tenant.\n \u2022 $4.4 million on land in Aberdeen. In performing our analysis related to the operating properties in Aberdeen, we determined that the weakening leasing and overall commercial real estate conditions in that market indicated that our land holdings in the market may be impaired. As a result, we determined that the carrying amount of the land was not recoverable and adjusted the land to its estimated fair value; \nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we abandoned plans to redevelop a property in our Fort Meade/BW Corridor sub-segment after we completed leasing on the property that did not require any redevelopment. Accordingly, we recognized an impairment loss of $2.4 million representing pre-development costs associated with the property.\nAs reflected above, our decrease in Same Properties NOI from real estate operations was due to a 3.5% increase in our Defense/IT Locations from 2016 to 2017, offset in part by a 5.2% decrease in our Regional Office segment from 2016 to 2017. These changes were due primarily to occupancy changes in the respective segments.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nActivities we conduct to monitor the credit quality of our tenants include the following: monitoring the timeliness of tenant lease payments; reviewing credit ratings of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit agency prior to such tenants' entry into leases, and monitoring periodically thereafter; reviewing financial statements of tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be provided to us pursuant to the terms of such tenants' leases; and monitoring news reports regarding our tenants.\n \u2022 a healthier and more predictable defense spending environment and bipartisan support to fund defense. Clarity regarding defense funding tends to improve the government's process for awarding contracts to prospective tenants, which improves our ability to lease space in Defense/IT Locations properties. We believe that the government's successive increases in defense funding for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 served to bring such clarity relative to prior years and, in turn, fueled much of the growth in demand for office space by the United States Government and its contractors that we observed in 2018. In addition, despite the government starting its fiscal year 2018 under yet another budget Continuing Resolution, the fiscal year: 2018 budget was ultimately signed into law during the year; and 2019 Department of Defense appropriations were \nfrom service operations is a useful measure in assessing both our level of activity and our profitability in conducting such operations.\n \u2022 how we expect to generate cash for short and long-term capital needs; and \n (4) Includes the removal of one property for which we have no leasing plan or intention to allocate future capital and one property reclassified as redevelopment. \nNet cash flow from operating activities decreased $49.6 million from 2017 to 2018 due primarily to our payment in 2018 of construction costs on a contract that the customer pre-funded to us in prior years.\nOffice and Data Center Shell Portfolio\nThis section contains forward-looking\u201d statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that are based on our current expectations, estimates and projections about future events and financial trends affecting the financial condition and operations of our business. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d believe,\u201d anticipate,\u201d expect,\u201d estimate,\u201d plan\u201d or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which we cannot predict with accuracy and some of which we might not even anticipate. Although we believe that the expectations, estimates and projections reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions at the time made, we can give no assurance that these expectations, estimates and projections will be achieved. Future events and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that may affect these expectations, estimates and projections include, but are not limited to:\nNet cash flow used in investing activities increased $143.6 million from 2017 to 2018 due to a $180.8 million decrease in property sales in 2018 relative to 2017, offset in part by a $40.5 million decrease in cash outlays for construction, development and redevelopment.\nThe decrease in general, administrative and leasing expenses from 2016 to 2017 was attributable primarily to $6.5 million of executive transition costs incurred in 2016, representing mostly severance and termination benefits in connection with the departures of former executive officers, compared to $732,000 in such costs recognized in 2017. Capitalized compensation and indirect costs were as follows:\nGeneral, Administrative and Leasing Expenses\n \u2022 Northern Virginia Defense/IT and Navy Support Locations: Occupancy increased due to progress we made in leasing previously vacant space in these sub-segments; \nGain on Sales of Real Estate\n \u2022 dividends and/or distributions to equity holders of $118.0 million; \nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to make certain estimates and assumptions. A summary of our significant accounting policies is provided in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The following section is a summary of certain aspects of those accounting policies involving estimates and assumptions that (1) require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in accounting for uncertain matters or matters that are susceptible to change and (2) materially affect our reported operating performance or financial condition. It is possible that the use of different reasonable estimates or assumptions in making these judgments could result in materially different amounts being reported in our consolidated financial statements. While reviewing this section, refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, including terms defined therein.\n \u2022 the amount of the purchase price allocated among different categories of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets; the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions; and the amount of gain recognized in our consolidated statements of operations should we determine that the fair value of the acquisition exceeds its cost; \nThe table below sets forth the computation of the above stated measures for the years ended December 31, 2014 through 2018 and provides reconciliations to the GAAP measures of COPT and subsidiaries associated with such measures:\nThe increase in capitalized costs for leasing and other from 2017 to 2018 was due to our implementation of an enterprise resource planning software package.\nFor COPT to maintain its qualification as a REIT, it must pay dividends to its shareholders aggregating annually to at least 90% of its ordinary taxable income. As a result of this distribution requirement, it cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that some other companies can. COPT may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund COPLP's working capital needs, development activities and acquisitions.\nAfter ending 2017 with our office and data center shell portfolio 93.6% occupied, our highest year-end occupancy since 2005, we ended 2018 with the portfolio 93.0% occupied. This decrease in occupancy was due primarily to the addition in 2018 of unoccupied space in a newly-constructed property targeted for United States Government use that has taken longer than expected to lease. Our Same Properties (defined below) were 93.0% occupied as of December 31, 2018, an increase from 92.1% as of December 31, 2017, with average occupancy of 91.5% in 2018.\n \u2022 general economic and business conditions, which will, among other things, affect office property and data center demand and rents, tenant creditworthiness, interest rates, financing availability and property values; \nAs discussed further below, the decrease in impairment losses was attributable primarily to impairment losses recognized in our Aberdeen, Maryland ( Aberdeen\u201d) portfolio in 2017.\n \u2022 net proceeds from the issuance of common shares (or units) of $202.1 million; offset in part by \n \u2022 $34.4 million on operating properties in Aberdeen (included in our Other segment). After shortening our estimated holding period for these properties, we determined that the carrying amount of the properties would not likely be recovered from the operation and eventual dispositions of the properties during the shortened holding period. Accordingly, we adjusted the properties to their estimated fair values; \nWe discuss significant factors contributing to changes in our net income over the last three years in the section below entitled Results of Operations.\u201d The results of operations discussion is combined for COPT and COPLP because there are no material differences in the results of operations between the two reporting entities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, COPT had forward equity sale agreements in place with 1.6 million shares available for future issuance with a settlement value of $46.4 million that we expect to use to fund development costs in March 2019.\nNet cash flow used in financing activities in 2017 was $338.5 million and included the following:\nOur 19.25 megawatt wholesale data center had 16.86 megawatts leased as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n \u2022 our commitments and contingencies. \n \u2022 $8.2 million on land in Frederick, Maryland. We determined that the carrying amount of the land would not likely be recovered from its sale and adjusted the land to its estimated fair value; \nThe changes reflected above between year end 2017 and 2018 were attributable primarily to growth in our Data Center Shells sub-segment from newly-constructed properties placed in service and increased occupancy in our Northern Virginia Defense/IT sub-segment. The changes reflected above between year end 2016 and 2017 were attributable primarily to dispositions of Regional Office properties and newly constructed properties placed into service in certain of our Defense/IT Location sub-segments; the Data Center Shells sub-segment's concentration was unchanged between year end 2016 and 2017 because the growth from newly-constructed properties placed in service was offset by the sale of two data center shells that were outside of our core markets.\nAcquisitions of Operating Properties\n \u2022 environmental requirements. \n \u2022 security breaches relating to cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or other factors; and \nAs discussed further below, the decrease in impairment losses was attributable primarily to decisions by us in 2016 to either sell, or abandon plans to develop, properties.\nAllowances for doubtful accounts and deferred rent receivable are established based on quarterly analyses of the risk of loss on specific accounts. The analyses place particular emphasis on past-due accounts and consider information such as the nature and age of the receivables, the payment history of the tenants, the financial condition of the tenants and our assessment of their ability to meet their lease obligations, the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations. Our estimate of the required allowance is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on tenants.\nWe believe that COPLP's liquidity and capital resources are adequate for its near-term and longer-term requirements without necessitating property sales. However, we may dispose of interests in properties opportunistically or when capital markets otherwise warrant.\n (4) Represents interest costs for our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2018 for the terms of such debt. For variable rate debt, the amounts reflected above used December 31, 2018 interest rates on variable rate debt in computing interest costs for the terms of such debt. We expect to pay these items using cash flow from operations. \nDuring our review we also recognized additional impairment losses of $11.5 million on properties previously classified as held for sale. Approximately $10.0 million of these losses pertained to properties in White Marsh due to our assessment that certain significant tenants will likely exercise lease termination rights and to reflect market conditions. The remainder of these losses pertained primarily to properties in San Antonio, Texas (included in our Other segment), where prospective purchasers reduced offering prices late in the third quarter. We executed property sales of $210.7 million in the third quarter of 2016 (discussed further in Note 5), and had $161.5 million of assets held for sale as of September 30, 2016.\nCash Flows\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, as part of our closing process, we conducted our quarterly review of our portfolio for indicators of impairment considering refinements to our disposition strategy made during the third quarter of 2016 to sell an additional operating property in our Northern Virginia Defense/IT sub-segment, an additional operating property in our Fort Meade/BW Corridor sub-segment and our remaining operating properties and land in White Marsh that had not previously been classified as held for sale. In connection with our determinations that we planned to sell these properties, we performed recoverability analyses for each of these properties and recorded the following impairment losses:\n (1) Includes estimated expense reimbursements. The decrease between year end 2016 and 2017 was attributable primarily to lower rents per square foot being in place for our properties placed in service in 2017 relative to the properties we sold since most of the properties we placed into service were data center shells and most of the ones sold were full service office properties. \nDiluted FFO per share, as adjusted for comparability is (1) Diluted FFO, as adjusted for comparability divided by (2) the sum of the (a) weighted average common shares outstanding during a period, (b) weighted average common units outstanding during a period and (c) weighted average number of potential additional common shares that would have been outstanding during a period if other securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common shares were converted or exchanged. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it provides investors with a further context for evaluating our FFO results. We believe this to be a useful supplemental measure alongside Diluted FFO per share as it excludes gains and losses from certain investing and financing activities and certain other items that we believe are not closely correlated to (or associated with) our operating performance. We believe that diluted EPS is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to this per share measure. This measure has most of the same limitations as Diluted FFO (described above) as well as the further limitation of not reflecting the effects of the excluded items; we compensate for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for Diluted FFO.\nIn 2017, we recognized gain on sales of real estate of $5.4 million in connection with land sales and $4.5 million on sales of operating properties. In 2016, we recognized gain on sales of real estate of $17.9 million on our sale of a 50% interest in six single-tenant data center properties, $15.9 million on sales of other operating properties and $7.2 million on land sales.\n\nIn 2018, we completed leasing on 4.2 million square feet, representing only the second time in the Company's history that our annual leasing volume exceeded 4.0 million square feet. This leasing volume was highlighted by a historically:\nConstruction contract and other service revenue and expenses increased due primarily to a greater volume of construction activity in connection with several of our tenants.\nOur NOI from constructed properties placed in service included 17 properties placed in service in 2016 and 2017.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n (6) Due to the long-term nature of certain construction and development contracts and leases included in these lines, the amounts reported in the table represent our estimate of the timing for the related obligations being payable. \n \u2022 continued strong demand for data center shell space. Data center shells have been a significant growth driver for our Defense/IT Locations in recent years. Development leasing of data center shells totaled 798,000 square feet in 2018, 743,000 square feet in 2017 and 728,000 square feet in 2016. All of this leasing pertained to properties in Northern Virginia, one of the largest data center markets in the world, and represented further expansion of our relationship with an existing tenant.

"summary": " Here are the key points from this MD&A report:\n\n- Net income increased $3.7 million from 2017 to 2018, primarily due to a $12.8 million decrease in impairment losses, offset partly by a $7.6 million decrease in gain on sales of real estate. \n\n- NOI from real estate operations decreased by $2.8 million from 2017 to 2018. This was driven by a $5.7 million decrease in the Regional Office segment, offset partially by a $3.7 million increase in the Defense/IT Locations segment.\n\n- Occupancy rate decreased from 93.6% at year-end 2017 to 93.0% at year-end 2018, primarily due to vacant space in a newly-constructed property. Same Properties occupancy increased from 92.1% to 93.0% over this period. \n\n- Construction leasing volume was strong in 2018, highlighted by 798,000 square feet of data center shells in Northern Virginia. \n\n- Impairment losses decreased significantly from $15.1 million in 2017 to $2.4 million in 2018, primarily due to losses on the Aberdeen portfolio in 2017.\n\n- Gain on sales of real estate decreased due to fewer property sales in 2018 compared to 2017. \n\n- Net cash from operating activities decreased $49.6 million primarily due to the timing of construction cost reimbursements. Net cash from investing decreased $143.6 million due to lower property sales.\n\nIn summary, COPT saw improved net income, strong leasing volume, and lower impairment losses in 2018 compared to 2017, but some challenges in same property NOI growth and occupancy. Overall liquidity remains stable."}
