Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. For the definitions of certain terms used in the following discussion, refer to Item 1, Business - Certain Definitions\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a REIT focused on the acquisition, ownership, and operation of single-tenant, industrial properties throughout the United States. We seek to (i) identify properties that offer relative value across all locations, industrial property types, and tenants through the principled application of our proprietary risk assessment model, (ii) operate our properties in an efficient, cost-effective manner, and (iii) capitalize our business appropriately given the characteristics of our assets. We are a Maryland corporation and our common stock is publicly traded on the NYSE under the symbol STAG.\u201d\nWe are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, and generally are not subject to federal income tax to the extent we currently distribute our income to our stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. We remain subject to state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.\nOur qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual annual operating results, qualification tests in the federal income tax laws. Those tests involve the percentage of income that we earn from specified sources, the percentage of our assets that falls within specified categories, the diversity of our capital stock ownership and the percentage of our earnings that we distribute.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned 492 buildings in 39 states with approximately 98.2 million rentable square feet, consisting of 409 warehouse/distribution buildings, 73 light manufacturing buildings, eight flex/office buildings, one Value Add Portfolio building, and one building classified as held for sale. We own both single- and multi-tenant properties, although we focus on the former.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our buildings were approximately 96.9% leased to 444 tenants, with no single tenant accounting for more than approximately 3.8% of our total annualized base rental revenue and no single industry accounting for more than approximately 12.4% of our total annualized base rental revenue.\nWe own the interests in all of our properties and conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership. We are the sole member of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2020, we owned approximately 98.0% of the common equity of our Operating Partnership, and our current and former executive officers, directors, senior employees and their affiliates, and third parties who contributed properties to us in exchange for common equity in our Operating Partnership, owned the remaining 2.0%.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nOur ability to increase revenues or cash flow will depend in part on our (i) external growth, specifically acquisition activity, and (ii) internal growth, specifically occupancy and rental rates on our portfolio. A variety of other factors, including those noted below, also affect our future results of operations.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nSince March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely harmed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the pandemic continues to evolve and many countries, including the United States, continue to react by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting almost every industry, including the real estate industry and the industries of our tenants, directly or indirectly. The rapid development and fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact the pandemic may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWhile we did not incur significant disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2020, a number of our tenants requested rent deferral or rent abatement as a result of the pandemic. In response to such requests, we entered into rent deferral agreement with certain tenants during the year ended December 31, 2020, which resulted in approximately $2.1 million of rent deferrals during the year ended December 31, 2020. We will continue to evaluate tenant rent relief requests on an individual basis, considering a number of factors. Not all tenant requests will ultimately result in modified agreements, nor are we foregoing our contractual rights under our lease agreements.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic or a future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of infectious disease affecting states or regions in which we or our tenants operate could have material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and\ncash flows due to, among other factors: health or other government authorities requiring the closure of offices or other businesses or instituting quarantines of personnel as the result of, or in order to avoid, exposure to a contagious disease; disruption in supply and delivery chains; a general decline in business activity and demand for real estate; reduced economic activity, general economic decline or recession, which may impact our tenants' businesses, financial condition and liquidity and may cause one or more of our tenants to be unable to make rent payments to us timely, or at all, or to otherwise seek modifications of lease obligations; difficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions, which may affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis; and the potential negative impact on the health of our personnel, particularly if a significant number of our employees are impacted, which would result in a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during a disruption.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any other pandemic, epidemic or disease impacts our operations and those of our tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic (or a future pandemic, epidemic or disease) presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOutlook\nOur business is affected by the uncertainty regarding the current COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of policies introduced to neutralize the disease, and the impact of those policies on economic activity. In June 2020, the National Bureau of Economic Research announced that the United States entered into a recession in February 2020. In the third and fourth quarter, certain economic measurements show that the U.S. economy is recovering. The ultimate shape of the recovery will depend on many factors, including the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. While there has been a negative impact to our tenants, we believe we will continue to benefit from having a well-diversified portfolio across various markets, tenant industries, and lease terms. Additionally, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating a number of trends that positively impact industrial demand.\nIn the first half of 2020, the U.S. federal and state governments, as well as the Federal Reserve, responded to the profoundly uncertain outlook with a series of policies to ease the economic burden of COVID-19 closures on businesses and individuals. The major U.S. congressional policy action known as the Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, allocated $2 trillion in federal aid to specific industries, small businesses and individuals. The Federal Reserve also took major actions including the completion of two emergency fed funds rate cuts in March 2020 to a range between 0% to 0.25%, which resulted in added liquidity to the bond market, establishing new lending facilities, and expanding its bond buying program to include mortgage backed securities, investment grade corporate debt, and high yield corporate exchange-traded funds. In the fourth quarter, due to surging COVID-19 cases in the United States, certain economic lockdown measures returned, and pressure on certain businesses renewed. In addition, in November 2020, the U.S. elections resulted in the Democratic party taking control of the Presidency and Congress. The new Biden administration entered office in January 2021 on the heels of the first phase of U.S. vaccine distribution and of a newly passed, $900 billion COVID-19 relief bill to further support businesses and individuals. We expect supportive fiscal and monetary policy to continue under the Biden administration as needed.\nWe believe that the current economic environment, while challenging, will provide us with an opportunity to demonstrate the diversification of our portfolio. Specifically, we believe our existing portfolio should benefit from competitive rental rates and strong occupancy. In addition to our diversified portfolio, we believe that certain characteristics of our business and capital structure should position us well in an uncertain environment, including the fact that we have minimal floating rate debt exposure (taking into account our hedging activities) and strong liquidity and access to capital, and that many of our competitors for the assets we purchase tend to be smaller local and regional investors who are likely to be more heavily impacted by interest rates and availability of capital.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect acceleration in a number of industrial specific trends to support stronger long-term demand, including:\n\u2022the rise of e-commerce (as compared to the traditional retail store distribution model) and the concomitant demand by e-commerce industry participants for well-located, functional distribution space;\n\u2022the increasing attractiveness of the United States as a manufacturing and distribution location because of the size of the U.S. consumer market, an increase in overseas labor costs, a desire for greater supply chain resilience and redundancy and the overall cost of supplying and shipping goods (i.e. the shortening and fattening of the supply chain); and\n\u2022the overall quality of the transportation infrastructure in the United States.\nOur portfolio continues to benefit from historically low availability throughout the national industrial market. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused both positive and negative impacts at varying levels across different industries and geographies. Ultimately, the acceleration in e-commerce brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken by federal and state governments and the Federal Reserve in response to the pandemic, and the recent economic recovery has helped industrial space demand remain strong as the national availability rate remains stable. We believe that the diversification of our portfolio by market, tenant industry, and tenant credit will prove to be a strength in this environment. Industrial development continues to be concentrated in the larger primary markets, and after a brief deceleration is expected to regain pre-COVID pandemic momentum. We have limited exposure to many of the most active development markets. We will continue to monitor the supply and demand fundamentals for industrial real estate and assess its impact on our business.\nConditions in Our Markets\nThe buildings in our portfolio are located in markets throughout the United States. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, new supply, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters and other factors in these markets may affect our overall performance.\nRental Income\nWe receive income primarily in the form of rental income from the tenants who occupy our buildings. The amount of rental income generated by the buildings in our portfolio depends principally on occupancy and rental rates.\nFuture economic downturns or regional downturns affecting our submarkets that impair our ability to renew or re-lease space and the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments, as in the case of tenant bankruptcies, including those brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our buildings. Our ability to lease our properties and the attendant rental rate is dependent upon, among other things, (i) the overall economy, (ii) the supply/demand dynamic in our markets, (iii) the quality of our properties, including age, clear height, and configuration, and (iv) our tenants' ability to meet their contractual obligations to us.\nThe following table summarizes our Operating Portfolio leases that commenced during the year ended December 31, 2020. Certain leases contain rental concessions; any such rental concessions are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td>Square Feet </td> <td> </td> <td>Cash\nBasis Rent Per\nSquare Foot </td> <td> </td> <td>SL Rent Per\nSquare Foot </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Costs Per\nSquare\nFoot(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Cash\nRent Change </td> <td> </td> <td>SL Rent Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average Lease\nTerm(2)\n(years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Rental Concessions per Square Foot(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New Leases </td> <td> </td> <td>2,775,376 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.81 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Renewal Leases </td> <td> </td> <td>8,880,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total/weighted average </td> <td> </td> <td>11,655,791 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)We define Total Costs as the costs for improvements of vacant and renewal spaces, as well as the contingent-based legal fees and commissions for leasing transactions. Total Costs per square foot represent the total costs expected to be incurred on the leases that commenced during the period and do not reflect actual expenditures for the period.\n(2)We define weighted average lease term as the contractual lease term in years, assuming that tenants exercise no renewal options, purchase options, or early termination rights, weighted by square footage.\n(3)Represents the total rental concessions for the entire lease term.\nAdditionally, for the year ended December 31, 2020, leases commenced totaling 879,203 square feet related to the Value Add Portfolio and are excluded from the Operating Portfolio statistics above.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nOur property operating expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, management fees, insurance, and site repair and maintenance costs. For the majority of our tenants, our property operating expenses are controlled, in part, by the triple net provisions in tenant leases. In our triple net leases, the tenant is responsible for all aspects of and costs related to the building and its operation during the lease term, including utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, but typically excluding roof and building structure. However, we also have modified gross leases and gross leases in our building portfolio. The terms of those leases vary and on some occasions we may absorb certain building related expenses of our tenants. In our modified gross leases, we are responsible for some building related expenses during the lease term, but the cost of most of the expenses is passed through to the tenant for reimbursement to us. In our gross leases, we are responsible for all costs related to the building and its operation during the lease term. Our overall performance will be affected by the extent to which we are able to pass-through property operating expenses to our tenants.\nScheduled Lease Expirations\nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases will impact our results of operations and is affected by economic and competitive conditions in our markets and by the desirability of our individual buildings. Leases that comprise approximately 8.4% of our total annualized base rental revenue will expire during the period from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, excluding month-to-month leases. We assume, based upon internal renewal probability estimates, that some of our tenants will renew and others will vacate and the associated space will be re-let subject to downtime assumptions. Using the aforementioned assumptions, we expect that the rental rates on the respective new leases will generally be the same as the rates under existing leases expiring during the period January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, thereby resulting in approximately the same revenue from the same space.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nSee Note 2 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.\nRental Property and Deferred Leasing Intangibles\nRental property is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Significant renovations and betterments that extend the economic useful lives of assets are capitalized.\nWe capitalize costs directly and indirectly related to the development, pre-development, redevelopment, or improvement of rental property. Real estate taxes, compensation costs of development personnel, insurance, interest, and other directly related costs during construction periods are capitalized as incurred, with depreciation commencing with the date the property is substantially completed. Such costs begin to be capitalized to the development projects from the point we are undergoing the necessary activities to get the development project ready for its intended use and cease when the development projects are substantially completed and held available for occupancy. Interest is capitalized based on actual capital expenditures from the period when development or redevelopment commences until the asset is ready for its intended use, at the weighted average borrowing rate of our unsecured indebtedness during the period.\nFor properties classified as held for sale, we cease depreciating and amortizing the rental property and value the rental property at the lower of depreciated and amortized cost or fair value less costs to dispose. We present those properties classified as held for sale with any qualifying assets and liabilities associated with those properties as held for sale in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nUsing information available at the time of acquisition, we allocate the purchase price of properties acquired based upon the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which generally consist of land, buildings, tenant improvements, mortgage debt assumed, and deferred leasing intangibles, which includes in-place leases, above market and below market leases, and tenant relationships. The process for determining the allocation to these components requires estimates and assumptions, including rental rates, discount rates and exit capitalization rates, and land value per square foot, as well as available market information. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. The portion of the purchase price that is allocated to above and below market leases is valued based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in-place rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease term plus the term of any bargain renewal options. The purchase price is further allocated to in-place lease values and tenant relationships based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and its overall relationship with the respective tenant.\nThe above and below market lease values are amortized into rental income over the remaining lease term. The value of in-place lease intangibles and tenant relationships are amortized over the remaining lease term (and expected renewal period of the respective lease for tenant relationships) as increases to depreciation and amortization expense. The remaining lease terms are adjusted for bargain renewal options or assumed exercises of early termination options, as applicable. If a tenant subsequently terminates its lease, any unamortized portion of above and below market leases is accelerated into rental income and the in-place lease value and tenant relationships are accelerated into depreciation and amortization expense over the shortened lease term.\nThe purchase price allocated to deferred leasing intangible assets are included in rental property, net on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and the purchase price allocated to deferred leasing intangible liabilities are included in deferred leasing intangibles, net on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets under the liabilities section.\nIn determining the fair value of the debt assumed, we discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on mortgage debt based on a current market rate. The associated fair market value debt adjustment is amortized through interest expense over the life of the debt on a basis which approximates the effective interest method.\nWe evaluate the carrying value of all tangible and intangible rental property assets and deferred leasing intangible liabilities (collectively, the property\u201d) held for use for possible impairment when an event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates their carrying value may not be recoverable. The evaluation includes estimating and reviewing anticipated future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the property. If such cash flows are less than the property's carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent by which the property's carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. Estimating future cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding anticipated hold period, future\noccupancy, rental rates, capital requirements, and exit capitalization rates that could differ from actual results. The discount rate used to present value the cash flows for determining fair value is also subjective.\nDepreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description </td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated Useful Life </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building </td> <td> </td> <td>40 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building and land improvements (maximum) </td> <td> </td> <td>20 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements </td> <td> </td> <td>Shorter of useful life or terms of related lease </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLeases\nFor leases in which we are the lessee, we recognize a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets equal to the present value of the fixed lease payments. In determining operating right-of-use asset and lease liability for our operating leases, we estimate an appropriate incremental borrowing rate on a fully-collateralized basis for the terms of the leases. We utilize a market-based approach to estimate the incremental borrowing rate for each individual lease. Since the terms under our ground leases are significantly longer than the terms of borrowings available to us on a fully-collateralized basis, the estimate of this rate required significant judgment, and considered factors such as yields on outstanding public debt and other market based pricing on longer duration financing instruments.\nGoodwill\nThe excess of the cost of an acquired business over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Our goodwill of approximately $4.9 million represents amounts allocated to the assembled workforce from the acquired management company, and is presented in prepaid expenses and other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our goodwill has an indeterminate life and is not amortized, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis at December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We take a qualitative approach to consider whether an impairment of goodwill exists prior to quantitatively determining the fair value of the reporting unit in step one of the impairment test. We have recorded no impairments to goodwill as of December 31, 2020.\nUse of Derivative Financial Instruments\nWe record all derivatives on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.\nIn accordance with fair value measurement guidance, we made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of our derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting arrangements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio. Credit risk is the risk of failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the contract. We minimize the credit risk in our derivative financial instruments by entering into transactions with various high-quality counterparties. Our exposure to credit risk at any point is generally limited to amounts recorded as assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFinancial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, tenant accounts receivable, interest rate swaps, accounts payable, accrued expenses, unsecured credit facility, unsecured term loans, unsecured notes, and mortgage notes. See Note 4 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the fair value of our indebtedness. See Note 5 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the fair value of our interest rate swaps.\nWe adopted fair value measurement provisions for our financial instruments recorded at fair value. The guidance establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nIncentive and Equity-Based Employee Compensation Plans\nWe grant equity-based compensation awards to our employees and directors in the form of restricted shares of common stock, LTIP units, and outperformance programs and performance units (outperformance programs and performance units are collectively, the Performance-based Compensation Plans\u201d). See Notes 6, 7 and 8 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of restricted shares of common stock, LTIP units, and Performance-based Compensation Plans, respectively. We measure equity-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date and recognize the expense ratably over the vesting period, and forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nRevenue Recognition\nAll current leases are classified as operating leases and rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease (and expected bargain renewal terms or assumed exercise of early termination options) when collectability is reasonably assured. Differences between rental income earned and amounts due under the lease are charged or credited, as applicable, to accrued rental income.\nWe determined that for all leases where we are the lessor, that the timing and pattern of transfer of the non-lease components and associated lease components are the same, and that the lease components, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease. Accordingly, we have made an accounting policy election to recognize the combined component in accordance with Topic 842 as rental income on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRental income recognition commences when the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased space and the leased space is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. In order to determine whether the leased space is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, we determine whether we or the tenant own the tenant improvements. When it is determined that we are the owner of the tenant improvements, rental income recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the finished space, which is generally when our owned tenant improvements are completed. In instances when it is determined that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements, rental income recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased space.\nWhen we are the owner of tenant improvements or other capital items, the cost to construct the tenant improvements or other capital items, including costs paid for or reimbursed by the tenants, is recorded as capital assets. For these tenant improvements or other capital items, the amount funded by or reimbursed by the tenants are recorded as deferred revenue, which is amortized on a straight-line basis as income over the shorter of the useful life of the capital asset or the term of the related lease.\nEarly lease termination fees are recorded in rental income on a straight-line basis from the notification date of such termination to the then remaining (not the original) lease term, if any, or upon collection if collection is not reasonably assured.\nWe evaluate cash basis versus accrual basis of rental income recognition based on the collectability of future lease payments.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion of our results of our same store (as defined below) net operating income ( NOI\u201d) should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below. Same store results are considered to be useful to investors in evaluating our performance because they provide information relating to changes in building-level operating performance without taking into account the effects of acquisitions or dispositions. We encourage the reader to not only look at our same store results, but also our total portfolio results, due to historic and future growth.\nWe define same store properties as properties that were in the Operating Portfolio for the entirety of the comparative periods presented. The results for same store properties exclude termination fees, solar income, and revenue associated with one-time tenant reimbursements of capital expenditures. Same store properties exclude Operating Portfolio properties with expansions placed into service or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2018. On December 31, 2020, we owned 364 industrial buildings consisting of approximately 71.7 million square feet, which represents approximately 73.0% of our total portfolio, that are considered our same store portfolio in the analysis below. Same store occupancy increased approximately 0.4% to 96.4% as of December 31, 2020 compared to 96.0% as of December 31, 2019.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019\nThe following table summarizes selected operating information for our same store portfolio and our total portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands). This table includes a reconciliation from our same store portfolio to our total portfolio by also providing information for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 with respect to the buildings acquired and disposed of and Operating Portfolio buildings with expansions placed into service or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2018 and our flex/office buildings, Value Add Portfolio, and buildings classified as held for sale.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

to investors, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nNet Income\nNet income for our total portfolio increased by $156.1 million or 308.2% to $206.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $50.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSame Store Total Operating Revenue\nSame store total operating revenue consists primarily of rental income consisting of (i) fixed lease payments, variable lease payments, straight-line rental income, and above and below market lease amortization from our properties ( lease income\u201d), and (ii) other tenant billings for insurance, real estate taxes and certain other expenses ( other billings\u201d).\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our same store total operating revenue to net income, see the table above.\nSame store rental income, which is comprised of lease income and other billings as discussed below, increased by $3.2 million or 0.9% to $354.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $351.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSame store lease income increased by $1.9 million or 0.7% to $298.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $296.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Approximately $10.0 million of the increase was attributable to rental increases due to new leases and renewals of existing tenants and approximately $0.1 million due to a net decrease in the amortization of net above market leases. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of rental income of approximately $3.2 million at properties where we determined that the future collectability of revenue was not reasonably assured, and accordingly, we converted to the cash basis of accounting for the leases and reversed any accounts receivable and accrued rent balances into rental income and did not recognize revenue for payments that were not received from the tenants. Additionally, the increase was partially offset by an approximately $5.0 million decrease due to a reduction of base rent due to tenants downsizing their spaces and vacancies.\nSame store other billings increased by $1.3 million or 2.3% to $55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in other billings for insurance and other certain expenses of $1.1 million due to increased occupancy at certain buildings. The increase was also attributable to an increase in real estate taxes levied by the taxing authority and changes to lease terms where we began paying the real estate taxes and operating expenses on behalf of tenants that had previously paid its taxes and operating expenses directly to respective vendors of approximately $0.2 million.\nSame Store Operating Expenses\nSame store operating expenses consist primarily of property operating expenses and real estate taxes and insurance.\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our same store portfolio operating expenses to net income, see the table above.\nTotal same store operating expenses increased by $0.7 million or 1.1% to $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily related to increases in real estate taxes levied by the applicable taxing authority and changes to lease terms where we began paying the real estate taxes on behalf of tenants that had previously paid the taxes directly to the taxing authority of approximately $1.0 million, as well as an increase in repairs and maintenance expense and insurance expense of approximately $0.7 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in snow removal expense of approximately $0.8 million and a decrease in utility expense of $0.2 million.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions Net Operating Income\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our acquisitions and dispositions NOI to net income, see the table above.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2018, we acquired 110 buildings consisting of approximately 24.0 million square feet (excluding six buildings that were included in the Value Add Portfolio at December 31, 2020 or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2018), and sold 16 buildings and two land parcels consisting of approximately 5.0 million square feet. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the buildings acquired after December 31, 2018 contributed approximately $86.5 million and $27.6 million to NOI, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the buildings sold after December 31, 2018 contributed approximately $7.9 million and $9.7 million to NOI, respectively.\nRefer to Note 3 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding buildings acquired or sold.\nOther Net Operating Income\nOur other assets include our flex/office buildings, Value Add Portfolio, buildings classified as held for sale, and Operating Portfolio buildings with expansions placed in service or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2018. Other NOI also includes termination, solar, and other income adjustments from buildings in our same store portfolio.\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our other NOI to net income, see the table above.\nAt December 31, 2020 we owned eight flex/office buildings consisting of approximately 0.4 million square feet, one building in our Value Add Portfolio consisting of approximately 0.1 million square feet, one building classified as held for sale consisting of approximately 20,000 square feet, and eight buildings consisting of approximately 2.0 million square feet that were Operating Portfolio buildings with expansions placed in service or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2018. These buildings contributed approximately $7.4 million and $4.4 million to NOI for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, there was $1.0 million and $0.2 million of termination, solar, and other income adjustments from certain buildings in our same store portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nTotal Other Expenses\nTotal other expenses consist of general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, loss on impairments, and other expenses.\nTotal other expenses increased $29.5 million or 12.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $262.4 million compared to $232.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This is primarily a result of an increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $29.3 million as a result of acquisitions that increased the depreciable asset base. Additionally, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $4.1 million primarily due to increases in compensation and other payroll costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $4.2 million in loss on impairments as discussed in Note 3 of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTotal Other Income (Expense)\nTotal other income (expense) consists of interest and other income, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on involuntary conversion, and gain on the sales of rental property, net. Interest expense includes interest incurred during the period as well as adjustments related to amortization of financing fees and debt issuance costs, and amortization of fair market value adjustments associated with the assumption of debt.\nTotal net other income increased $122.3 million or 259.3% to $75.2 million total other income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $47.2 million total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is primarily the result of an increase in the gain on the sales of rental property, net of $128.3 million, as well as an increase in gain on involuntary conversion of $2.2 million. Additionally, there was an increase of approximately $0.4 million in interest and other income due to an increased cash and cash equivalents balance during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. These increases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense of approximately $7.7 million which was primarily attributable to the funding of unsecured term loans on March 25, 2020, December 18, 2019, and July 25, 2019. Additionally, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 that was primarily related to the refinance of the Unsecured Term Loan B and the Unsecured Term Loan C on April 17, 2020, as discussed in Note 4 of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nComparison of year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018\nThe following table summarizes selected operating information for our same store portfolio and our total portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands). The table includes a reconciliation from our same store portfolio to our total portfolio by also providing information for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 with respect to the buildings acquired and disposed of and Operating Portfolio buildings with expansions placed into service or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2017 and our

</tr>\n</table>\n(1)For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nNet Income\nNet income for our total portfolio decreased by $45.6 million or 47.4% to $50.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSame Store Total Operating Revenue\nSame store total operating revenue consists primarily of rental income consisting of (i) fixed lease payments, variable lease payments, straight-line rental income, and above and below market lease amortization from our properties ( lease income\u201d), and (ii) other tenant billings for insurance, real estate taxes and certain other expenses ( other billings\u201d).\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our same store total operating revenue to net income, see the table above.\nSame store rental income, which is comprised of lease income and other billings as discussed below, increased by $6.3 million or 2.2% to $299.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $293.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSame store lease income increased by $3.9 million or 1.9% to $252.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $249.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Approximately $7.4 million of the increase was attributable to rental increases due to new leases and renewals of existing tenants and approximately $0.6 million due to a net decrease in the amortization of net above market leases. This increase was partially offset by an approximately $4.1 million decrease due to a reduction of base rent due to tenants downsizing their spaces and vacancies.\nSame store other billings increased by $2.5 million or 5.6% to $46.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $44.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in real estate taxes levied by the taxing authority and changes to lease terms where we began paying the real estate taxes and operating expenses on behalf of tenants that had previously paid its taxes and operating expenses directly to respective vendors of approximately $2.8 million. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $0.3 million related to tenant specific billings that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 that did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSame store other income decreased by $0.5 million or 55.8% to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is primarily the result of income received during the year ended December 31, 2018 for settlements or other sums received from former tenants which did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSame Store Operating Expenses\nSame store operating expenses consist primarily of property operating expenses and real estate taxes and insurance.\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our same store portfolio operating expenses to net income, see the table above.\nTotal same store expenses increased by $1.8 million or 3.4% to $55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $53.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily related to increases in real estate taxes levied by the related taxing authority and changes to lease terms where we began paying the real estate taxes on behalf of tenants that had previously paid its taxes directly to the taxing authority of approximately $3.1 million, as well as an increase in snow removal and other expenses of approximately $0.6 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in insurance expenses of approximately $1.4 million and a decrease in repairs and maintenance and utility expenses of $0.5 million.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions Net Operating Income\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our acquisitions and dispositions NOI to net income, see the table above.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2017, we acquired 115 buildings consisting of approximately 25.0 million square feet (excluding seven buildings that were included in the Value Add Portfolio at December 31, 2019 or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2017), and sold 28 buildings and two land parcels consisting of approximately 5.5 million square feet. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the buildings acquired after December 31, 2017 contributed approximately $77.0 million and $18.2 million to NOI, respectively. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2019 and 2018, the buildings sold after December 31, 2017 contributed approximately $(0.7) million and $13.3 million to NOI, respectively. Refer to Note 3 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding buildings acquired or sold.\nOther Net Operating Income\nOur other assets include our flex/office buildings, Value Add Portfolio, buildings classified as held for sale, and Operating Portfolio buildings with expansions placed in service or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2017. Other NOI also includes termination income from buildings from our same store portfolio.\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our other NOI to net income, see the table above.\nAt December 31, 2019 we owned eight flex/office buildings consisting of approximately 0.4 million square feet, six buildings in our Value Add Portfolio consisting of approximately 1.4 million square feet, two buildings classified as held for sale consisting of approximately 0.7 million square feet, and six buildings consisting of approximately 1.6 million square feet that were Operating Portfolio buildings with expansions placed in service or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2017. These buildings contributed approximately $9.7 million and $10.0 million to NOI for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Additionally, there was $0.1 million and $(0.2) million of termination, solar, and other income adjustments from certain buildings in our same store portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nTotal Other Expenses\nTotal other expenses consist of general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, loss on impairments, and other expenses.\nTotal other expenses increased $23.8 million or 11.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $232.9 million compared to $209.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This is primarily a result of an increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $17.8 million as a result of acquisitions that increased the depreciable asset base, as well as an increase of approximately $3.6 million in loss on impairments. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.9 million primarily due to increases in compensation and other payroll costs.\nTotal Other Income (Expense)\nTotal other income (expense) consists of interest and other income, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, and gain on the sales of rental property, net. Interest expense includes interest incurred during the period as well as adjustments related to amortization of financing fees and debt issuance costs, and amortization of fair market value adjustments associated with the assumption of debt.\nTotal net other income decreased $70.6 million or 301.6% to $47.2 million total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $23.4 million total other income for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is primarily the result of an decrease in the gain on the sales of rental property, net of approximately $64.8 million. This decrease is also attributable to an increase in interest expense of approximately $5.8 million which was primarily attributable to the funding of unsecured term loans on March 28, 2018, July 27, 2018, July 25, 2019, and December 18, 2019, and the funding of unsecured notes on June 13, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this report, we disclose funds from operations ( FFO\u201d) and NOI, which meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures\u201d as set forth in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. As a result, we are required to include in this report a statement of why management believes that presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors.\nFunds From Operations\nFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, and we believe that to understand our performance further, FFO should be compared with our reported net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nWe calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating buildings, impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and fair market value of debt adjustment) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nManagement uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs. FFO may be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs.\nHowever, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our buildings that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our buildings, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nThe following table summarizes a reconciliation of our FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders for the periods presented to net income, the nearest GAAP equivalent.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Net Income to FFO (in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>206,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,665 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,245 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental property depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>214,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>167,321 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on impairments </td> <td> </td> <td>5,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,182 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on the sales of rental property, net </td> <td> </td> <td>(135,733) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,392) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(72,211) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>291,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>238,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>197,537 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred stock dividends </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,156) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,156) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,604) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redemption of preferred stock </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,661) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount allocated to restricted shares of common stock and unvested units </td> <td> </td> <td>(756) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(891) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(751) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>285,191 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>232,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>186,521 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Operating Income\nWe consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income (loss) because we believe it helps investors and management understand the core operations of our buildings. NOI is defined as rental income, which includes billings for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, less property expenses. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our financial performance since it excludes expenses which could materially impact our results of operations. Further, our NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.\nThe following table summarizes a reconciliation of our NOI for the periods presented to net income, the nearest GAAP equivalent.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Net Income to NOI (in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>206,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,665 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,245 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td>40,072 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,946 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,052 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction costs </td> <td> </td> <td>159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>214 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>214,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185,450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>167,617 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income </td> <td> </td> <td>(446) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>62,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,817 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on impairments </td> <td> </td> <td>5,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,182 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on involuntary conversion </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,157) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt </td> <td> </td> <td>834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>1,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,063 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on the sales of rental property, net </td> <td> </td> <td>(135,733) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,392) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(72,211) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>394,052 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>330,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>281,972 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flows (dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>293,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>233,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>554,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,222,574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(667,951) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(54.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>269,176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>978,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(709,363) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(72.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $60.6 million to $293.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $233.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to incremental operating cash flows from property acquisitions completed after December 31, 2019, and operating performance at existing properties. These increases were partially offset by the loss of cash flows from property dispositions completed after December 31, 2019 and fluctuations in working capital due to timing of payments and rental receipts.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $668.0 million to $554.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash paid for the acquisition of 48 buildings during the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately $773.3 million, compared to the acquisition of 69 buildings during the year ended December 31, 2019 of approximately $1,203.4 million. The decrease is also attributable to an increase in net proceeds from the sale of seven buildings during the year ended December 31, 2020 for net proceeds of approximately $273.6 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 where we sold nine buildings and two land parcels for net proceeds of approximately $42.0 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $709.4 million to $269.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $978.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in net cash outflow on our unsecured credit facility of approximately $84.5 million, a decrease in net proceeds from unsecured term loans of $175.0 million, a decrease in proceeds from sales of common stock of approximately $413.9 million, and an increase in dividends paid of $34.7 million.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flows (dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>233,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>197,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,222,574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>507,201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>715,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>978,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>303,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>674,694 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $35.6 million to $233.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $197.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to incremental operating cash flows from property acquisitions completed after December 31, 2018, and operating performance at existing properties. These increases were partially offset by the loss of cash flows from property dispositions completed after December 31, 2018 and fluctuations in working capital due to timing of payments and rental receipts.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $715.4 million to $1,222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $507.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash paid for the acquisition of 69 buildings during the year ended December 31, 2019 of approximately $1,203.4 million, compared to the acquisition of 53 buildings during the year ended December 31, 2018 of approximately $675.6 million. The increase is also attributable to a decrease in net proceeds from the sale of nine buildings and two land parcels during the year ended December 31, 2019 for net proceeds of approximately $42.0 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 where we sold 19 buildings for net proceeds of approximately $207.9 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $674.7 million to $978.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $303.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net cash inflow on our unsecured credit facility of approximately $216.0 million and an increase in proceeds from sales of common\nstock of approximately $466.3 million, as well as an increase in proceeds from unsecured term loans of $125.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. These increases were partially offset by decreases in proceeds from unsecured notes of $175.0 million and an approximately $30.7 million increase in dividends paid during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied through cash flows generated by operations, disposition proceeds, and financing activities. Operating cash flow is primarily rental income, expense recoveries from tenants, and other income from operations and is our principal source of funds that we use to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures, and the distributions required to maintain our REIT qualification. We look to the capital markets (common equity, preferred equity, and debt) to primarily fund our acquisition activity. We seek to increase cash flows from our properties by maintaining quality standards for our buildings that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. We believe that our revenue, together with proceeds from building sales and debt and equity financings, will continue to provide funds for our short-term and medium-term liquidity needs.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our buildings, including interest expense, interest rate swap payments, scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, funding of property acquisitions under contract, general and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures for tenant improvements and leasing commissions.\nOur long-term liquidity needs, in addition to recurring short-term liquidity needs as discussed above, consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, non-recurring capital expenditures, and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through cash flow from operations, the issuance of equity or debt securities, other borrowings, property dispositions, or, in connection with acquisitions of certain additional buildings, the issuance of common units in the Operating Partnership.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have worked to ensure that we maintain adequate liquidity. On April 17, 2020, we paid in full the amounts outstanding under our Unsecured Term Loan B and the Unsecured Term Loan C with proceeds from our new Unsecured Term Loan G, as discussed in Indebtedness Outstanding\u201d below. As of December 31, 2020, we had total immediate liquidity of approximately $405.7 million, comprised of $15.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $390.0 million of immediate availability on our unsecured credit facility. When incorporating the remaining undrawn balance available on our unsecured credit facility and the approximately $139.3 million of forward equity proceeds available to us at our option through November 16, 2021, our total liquidity as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $545.0 million.\nIn addition, we require funds for future dividends to be paid to our common and preferred stockholders and common unit holders in our Operating Partnership. These distributions on our common stock are voluntary (at the discretion of our board of directors), to the extent in excess of distribution requirements in order to maintain our REIT status for federal income tax purposes, and the excess portion may be reduced or stopped if needed to fund other liquidity requirements or for other reasons.

At December 31, 2020, the one-month LIBOR ( L\u201d) was 0.1439%. The interest rate is not adjusted to include the amortization of deferred financing fees or debt issuance costs incurred in obtaining debt or any unamortized fair market value premiums. The spread over the applicable rate for our unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loans is based on our debt rating, as defined in the respective loan agreements.\n(2)The unsecured term loans have a stated interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 1.0%, with the exception of the Unsecured Term Loan G which has a spread of 1.5% and is subject to a minimum rate for LIBOR of 0.25%. As of December 31, 2020, one-month LIBOR for the Unsecured Term Loans A, D, E, F, and G was swapped to a fixed rate of 2.38%, 1.85%, 2.92%, 2.11%, and 1.17%, respectively. One-month LIBOR for the Unsecured Term Loan G will be swapped to a fixed rate of 0.28% effective March 19, 2021.\n(3)Prepayment terms consist of (i) pre-payable with no penalty; (ii) pre-payable with penalty; (iii) pre-payable without penalty three months prior to the maturity date, however can be defeased; and (iv) pre-payable without penalty three months prior to the maturity date.\n(4)The capacity of the unsecured credit facility is $500.0 million. The initial maturity date is January 15, 2023, which may be extended pursuant to two six-month extension options exercisable at our discretion upon advance written notice. Exercise of each six-month option is subject to the following conditions: (i) absence of a default immediately before the extension and immediately after giving effect to the extension, (ii) accuracy of representations and warranties as of the extension date (both immediately before and after the extension), as if made on the extension date, and (iii) payment of a fee.\n(5)The initial maturity date is April 16, 2021, which may be extended pursuant to two one-year extension options exercisable at our discretion upon advance written notice. Exercise of each one-year option is subject to the following conditions: (i) absence of a default immediately before the extension and immediately after giving effect to the extension, (ii) accuracy of representations and warranties as of the extension date (both immediately before and after the extension), as if made on the extension date, and (iii) payment of a fee. Neither extension option is subject to lender consent, assuming proper notice and satisfaction of the conditions. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Unsecured Term Loan G was amended, as discussed below.\n(6)The weighted average interest rate was calculated using the fixed interest rate swapped on the current notional amount of $975.0 million of debt, and was not adjusted to include the amortization of deferred financing fees or debt issuance costs incurred in obtaining debt or any unamortized fair market value premiums.\nThe aggregate undrawn nominal commitments on the unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loans as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $390.0 million, including issued letters of credit. Our actual borrowing capacity at any given point in time may be less and is restricted to a maximum amount based on our debt covenant compliance.\nOn April 17, 2020, we entered into the $300.0 million Unsecured Term Loan G with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent on behalf of the various lenders under the agreement. In connection with execution of the Unsecured Term Loan G, the Unsecured Term Loan B and Unsecured Term Loan C were paid in full. As of December 31, 2020, the Unsecured Term Loan G bore an interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 1.5% based on our debt rating, as defined in the loan agreement, and subject to a minimum rate for LIBOR of 0.25%. The Unsecured Term Loan G matures on April 16, 2021, subject to two one-year extension options at our discretion, and subject to certain conditions (other than lender discretion) such as the absence of default and the payment of an extension fee. At execution, we intended to exercise both extension options. To exercise the extension options we are required pay a fee equal to (i) 0.15% of the outstanding amount on the effective day of the first extension period and (ii) 0.20% of the outstanding amount on the effective day of the second extension period. The Unsecured Term Loan G has an accordion feature that allows us to increase its borrowing capacity to $600.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and lender consents. The Company and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership are guarantors of the Unsecured Term Loan G. The agreement also contains financial and other covenants substantially similar to the covenants in our unsecured credit facility.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, on February 5, 2021, we entered into (i) an amendment to the unsecured credit facility (the Credit Facility Amendment\u201d) and (ii) an amendment to the Unsecured Term Loan G (the Amendment to Unsecured Term Loan G\u201d). The Credit Facility Amendment provides for an increase in the aggregate commitments available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility from $500 million to up to $750 million. Other than the increase in the borrowing commitments, the material terms of the unsecured credit facility remain unchanged. The Amendment to Unsecured Term Loan G provides for an extension of the maturity date to February 5, 2026 and a reduced stated interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus a spread that ranges from 0.85% to 1.65% for LIBOR borrowings based on our debt ratings. The Amendment to Unsecured Term Loan G also amended the provision for a minimum interest rate, or floor, for LIBOR borrowings to 0.00%. As of February 5, 2021, borrowings under the Unsecured Term Loan G bore interest at LIBOR plus 1.00%. We previously entered into interest rate swaps to fix LIBOR on the Unsecured Term Loan G at 1.17% and, effective March 19, 2021, at 0.28% through April 18, 2023. Other than the maturity and interest rate provisions described above, the material terms of the Unsecured Term Loan G remain unchanged.\nThe Wells Fargo Bank, National Association CMBS loan agreement is a commercial mortgage backed security that provides for a secured loan. There are 24 properties that are collateral for the CMBS loan. The Operating Partnership guarantees the obligations under the CMBS loan.\nThe following table summarizes our debt capital structure as of December 31, 2020.\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Capital Structure </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total principal outstanding (in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,709,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average duration (years) </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% Secured debt </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% Debt maturing next 12 months </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Debt to Real Estate Cost Basis (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)We define Net Debt as our amounts outstanding under our unsecured credit facility, unsecured term loans, unsecured notes, and mortgage notes, less cash and cash equivalents. We define Real Estate Cost Basis as the book value of rental property and deferred leasing intangibles, exclusive of the related accumulated depreciation and amortization.\nWe regularly pursue new financing opportunities to ensure an appropriate balance sheet position. As a result of these dedicated efforts, we are confident in our ability to meet future debt maturities and building acquisition funding needs. We believe that our current balance sheet is in an adequate position at the date of this filing, despite possible volatility in the credit markets.\nOur interest rate exposure as it relates to interest expense payments on our floating rate debt is managed through our use of interest rate swaps, which fix the rate of our long term floating rate debt. For a detailed discussion on our use of interest rate swaps, see Interest Rate Risk\u201d below.\nUnsecured Credit Facility, Unsecured Term Loans, and Unsecured Notes\nThe unsecured credit facility provides for a facility fee payable by us to the lenders at a rate per annum of 0.125% to 0.3%, depending on our debt rating, as defined in the credit agreement, of the aggregate commitments (currently $500.0 million). The facility fee is due and payable quarterly.\nCovenants: Our ability to borrow, maintain borrowings and avoid default under the unsecured credit facility, the unsecured term loans, and unsecured notes is subject to our ongoing compliance with a number of financial covenants, including:\n\u2022a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than 0.60:1.00;\n\u2022a maximum secured leverage ratio of not greater than 0.40:1.00;\n\u2022a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio of not greater than 0.60:1.00;\n\u2022a minimum fixed charge ratio of not less than or equal to 1.50:1.00; and\n\u2022a minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio of not less than or equal to 1.75:1.00.\nThe respective note purchase agreements additionally contain a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00.\nPursuant to the terms of our unsecured debt agreements, we may not pay distributions that exceed the minimum amount required for us to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT if a default or event of default occurs and is continuing.\nOur unsecured credit facility, unsecured term loans, unsecured notes, and mortgage notes are subject to ongoing compliance with a number of financial and other covenants. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the applicable financial covenants.\nEvents of Default: Our unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loans contain customary events of default, including but not limited to non-payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts, defaults in the compliance with the covenants contained in the documents evidencing the unsecured credit facility and the unsecured term loans, cross-defaults to other material debt and bankruptcy or other insolvency events.\nBorrower and Guarantors: The Operating Partnership is the borrower under the unsecured credit facility, the unsecured term loans and is the issuer of the unsecured notes. STAG Industrial, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries guarantee the obligations under our unsecured debt agreements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, specifically our obligations under long-term debt agreements and ground lease agreements.\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations (in thousands)(1)(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022-2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024-2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments(3)(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,709,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>857,038 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>600,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments-Fixed rate debt(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125,426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,237 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments -Variable rate debt(5)(6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property lease\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,773 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,925 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,001 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ground leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,032 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,702 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,364 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,984,541 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>949,479 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>646,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>328,602 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments, such as maintenance agreements at our buildings.

On December 15, 2020, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 1,200,000 shares for an offering price of $29.90 per share. The offering closed on November 19, 2020 and the underwriters' option closed on December 17, 2020. On December 23, 2020, we partially settled the forward sales agreements by issuing 4,518,077 shares of common stock and received net proceeds of approximately $135.0 million. Subject to our right to elect cash or net share settlement, we have the ability to settle the remaining forward sales agreements at any time through scheduled maturity date of the forward sale agreements of November 16, 2021.\nOn January 13, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of an aggregate of 10,062,500 shares of common stock at a price to the underwriters of $30.9022 per share, consisting of (i) 5,600,000 shares offered directly by us and (ii) 4,462,500 shares offered by the forward dealer in connection with certain forward sale agreements (including 1,312,500 shares offered pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, which option was exercised in full).

As of December 31, 2020, all of our outstanding variable rate debt, with the exception of our unsecured credit facility, was fixed with interest rate swaps through maturity.\nWe recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of equity. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value and the changes in fair value must be reflected as income or expense.\nWe have established criteria for suitable counterparties in relation to various specific types of risk. We only use counterparties that have a credit rating of no lower than investment grade at swap inception from Moody's Investor Services, Standard & Poor's, Fitch Ratings, or other nationally recognized rating agencies.\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2020.\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

interest rate risk, and all are valued as Level 2 financial instruments. Level 2 financial instruments are defined as significant other observable inputs. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of all of our 24 interest rate swaps were in a liability position of approximately $40.7 million, including any adjustment for nonperformance risk related to these agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1,082.0 million of variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2020, all of our outstanding variable rate debt, with exception of our unsecured credit facility, was fixed with interest rate swaps through maturity. To the extent interest rates increase, interest costs on our floating rate debt not fixed with interest rate swaps will increase, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our security holders. From time to time, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts, including swaps, caps and floors. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amounts third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.\nInflation\nOur business could be impacted in multiple ways due to inflation. We believe, however, that we are well positioned to be able to manage our business in an inflationary environment. Specifically, as of December 31, 2020 our weighted average lease term was approximately 5.2 years and, on average, approximately 8-13% of our total annualized base rental revenue will roll annually over the next few years. We expect that this lease roll will allows us to capture inflationary increases in rent on a relatively efficient basis. In addition, as of December 31, 2020 we have long term liabilities averaging approximately 3.4 years when excluding our unsecured credit facility. Our variable rate debt as of December 31, 2020 has been fully swapped to fixed rates through maturity with the exception of our unsecured credit facility. Therefore, as rents rise and increase our operating cash flow, this positive impact will flow more directly to the bottom line without the offset of higher in place debt costs. Lastly, while inflation will likely lead to increases in the operating costs of our portfolio, such as real estate taxes, utility expenses, and other operating expenses, the majority of our leases are either triple net leases or otherwise provide for tenant reimbursement for costs related to these expenses. Therefore, the increased costs in an inflationary environment would generally be passed through to our tenant.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had letters of credit related to development projects and certain other agreements of approximately $3.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had no other material off-balance sheet arrangements. See the table under Liquidity and Capital Resources-Contractual Obligations\u201d above for information regarding certain off-balance sheet arrangements.", "item_7_truncated": "We adopted fair value measurement provisions for our financial instruments recorded at fair value. The guidance establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td>

because we believe it helps investors and management understand the core operations of our buildings. NOI is defined as rental income, which includes billings for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, less property expenses. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our financial performance since it excludes expenses which could materially impact our results of operations. Further, our NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

For the majority of our tenants, our property operating expenses are controlled, in part, by the triple net provisions in tenant leases. In our triple net leases, the tenant is responsible for all aspects of and costs related to the building and its operation during the lease term, including utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, but typically excluding roof and building structure. However, we also have modified gross leases and gross leases in our building portfolio. The terms of those leases vary and on some occasions we may absorb certain building related expenses of our tenants. In our modified gross leases, we are responsible for some building related expenses during the lease term, but the cost of most of the expenses is passed through to the tenant for reimbursement to us. In our gross leases, we are responsible for all costs related to the building and its operation during the lease term. Our overall performance will be affected by the extent to which we are able to pass-through property operating expenses to our tenants.\nThe Wells Fargo Bank, National Association CMBS loan agreement is a commercial mortgage backed security that provides for a secured loan.

The decrease was primarily due to an increase in net cash outflow on our unsecured credit facility of approximately $84.5 million, a decrease in net proceeds from unsecured term loans of $175.0 million, a decrease in proceeds from sales of common stock of approximately $413.9 million, and an increase in dividends paid of $34.7 million.\nFor leases in which we are the lessee, we recognize a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets equal to the present value of the fixed lease payments. In determining operating right-of-use asset and lease liability for our operating leases, we estimate an appropriate incremental borrowing rate on a fully-collateralized basis for the terms of the leases. We utilize a market-based approach to estimate the incremental borrowing rate for each individual lease. Since the terms under our ground leases are significantly longer than the terms of borrowings available to us on a fully-collateralized basis, the estimate of this rate required significant judgment, and considered factors such as yields on outstanding public debt and other market based pricing on longer duration financing instruments.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flows (dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>233,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>197,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,588 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,222,574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>507,201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>715,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>978,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>303,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>674,694 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes a reconciliation of our FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders for the periods presented to net income, the nearest GAAP equivalent.\nThe following table summarizes our at-the market ( ATM\u201d) common stock offering program as of December 31, 2020.

Credit risk is the risk of failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the contract.

Those tests involve the percentage of income that we earn from specified sources, the percentage of our assets that falls within specified categories, the diversity of our capital stock ownership and the percentage of our earnings that we distribute.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nOverview\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $35.6 million to $233.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $197.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to incremental operating cash flows from property acquisitions completed after December 31, 2018, and operating performance at existing properties. These increases were partially offset by the loss of cash flows from property dispositions completed after December 31, 2018 and fluctuations in working capital due to timing of payments and rental receipts.\nComparison of year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any other pandemic, epidemic or disease impacts our operations and those of our tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others.

See Notes 6, 7 and 8 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of restricted shares of common stock, LTIP units, and Performance-based Compensation Plans, respectively. We measure equity-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date and recognize the expense ratably over the vesting period, and forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nEvents of Default: Our unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loans contain customary events of default, including but not limited to non-payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts, defaults in the compliance with the covenants contained in the documents evidencing the unsecured credit facility and the unsecured term loans, cross-defaults to other material debt and bankruptcy or other insolvency events.\n(6)Amounts include interest rate payments on the $975.0 million current notional amount of our interest rate swaps, as discussed below.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2018, we acquired 110 buildings consisting of approximately 24.0 million square feet (excluding six buildings that were included in the Value Add Portfolio at December 31, 2020 or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2018), and sold 16 buildings and two land parcels consisting of approximately 5.0 million square feet. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the buildings acquired after December 31, 2018 contributed approximately $86.5 million and $27.6 million to NOI, respectively.

The evaluation includes estimating and reviewing anticipated future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the property. If such cash flows are less than the property's carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent by which the property's carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. Estimating future cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding anticipated hold period, future\nSince March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely harmed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the pandemic continues to evolve and many countries, including the United States, continue to react by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting almost every industry, including the real estate industry and the industries of our tenants, directly or indirectly. The rapid development and fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact the pandemic may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLeases\nSame store rental income, which is comprised of lease income and other billings as discussed below, increased by $3.2 million or 0.9% to $354.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $351.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(3)Represents the total rental concessions for the entire lease term.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2017, we acquired 115 buildings consisting of approximately 25.0 million square feet (excluding seven buildings that were included in the Value Add Portfolio at December 31, 2019 or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2017), and sold 28 buildings and two land parcels consisting of approximately 5.5 million square feet. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the buildings acquired after December 31, 2017 contributed approximately $77.0 million and $18.2 million to NOI, respectively. For the years ended\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\n(3)Prepayment terms consist of (i) pre-payable with no penalty; (ii) pre-payable with penalty; (iii) pre-payable without penalty three months prior to the maturity date, however can be defeased; and (iv) pre-payable without penalty three months prior to the maturity date.\n\n(5)This is not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this report.\nFuture economic downturns or regional downturns affecting our submarkets that impair our ability to renew or re-lease space and the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments, as in the case of tenant bankruptcies, including those brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our buildings. Our ability to lease our properties and the attendant rental rate is dependent upon, among other things, (i) the overall economy, (ii) the supply/demand dynamic in our markets, (iii) the quality of our properties, including age, clear height, and configuration, and (iv) our tenants' ability to meet their contractual obligations to us.\nSame Store Operating Expenses\nGoodwill\nCash Flows\nThe buildings in our portfolio are located in markets throughout the United States. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, new supply, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters and other factors in these markets may affect our overall performance.\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our acquisitions and dispositions NOI to net income, see the table above.\nstock of approximately $466.3 million, as well as an increase in proceeds from unsecured term loans of $125.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. These increases were partially offset by decreases in proceeds from unsecured notes of $175.0 million and an approximately $30.7 million increase in dividends paid during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\u2022a minimum fixed charge ratio of not less than or equal to 1.50:1.00; and\nAdditionally, for the year ended December 31, 2020, leases commenced totaling 879,203 square feet related to the Value Add Portfolio and are excluded from the Operating Portfolio statistics above.\nRental Property and Deferred Leasing Intangibles\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $668.0 million to $554.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash paid for the acquisition of 48 buildings during the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately $773.3 million, compared to the acquisition of 69 buildings during the year ended December 31, 2019 of approximately $1,203.4 million. The decrease is also attributable to an increase in net proceeds from the sale of seven buildings during the year ended December 31, 2020 for net proceeds of approximately $273.6 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 where we sold nine buildings and two land parcels for net proceeds of approximately $42.0 million.\nWe own the interests in all of our properties and conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership. We are the sole member of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2020, we owned approximately 98.0% of the common equity of our Operating Partnership, and our current and former executive officers, directors, senior employees and their affiliates, and third parties who contributed properties to us in exchange for common equity in our Operating Partnership, owned the remaining 2.0%.\nTotal other expenses increased $23.8 million or 11.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $232.9 million compared to $209.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This is primarily a result of an increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $17.8 million as a result of acquisitions that increased the depreciable asset base, as well as an increase of approximately $3.6 million in loss on impairments. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.9 million primarily due to increases in compensation and other payroll costs.\nWe receive income primarily in the form of rental income from the tenants who occupy our buildings. The amount of rental income generated by the buildings in our portfolio depends principally on occupancy and rental rates.\nOn April 17, 2020, we entered into the $300.0 million Unsecured Term Loan G with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent on behalf of the various lenders under the agreement. In connection with execution of the Unsecured Term Loan G, the Unsecured Term Loan B and Unsecured Term Loan C were paid in full. As of December 31, 2020, the Unsecured Term Loan G bore an interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 1.5% based on our debt rating, as defined in the loan agreement, and subject to a minimum rate for LIBOR of 0.25%. The Unsecured Term Loan G matures on April 16, 2021, subject to two one-year extension options at our discretion, and subject to certain conditions (other than lender discretion) such as the absence of default and the payment of an extension fee. At execution, we intended to exercise both extension options. To exercise the extension options we are required pay a fee equal to (i) 0.15% of the outstanding amount on the effective day of the first extension period and (ii) 0.20% of the outstanding amount on the effective day of the second extension period. The Unsecured Term Loan G has an accordion feature that allows us to increase its borrowing capacity to $600.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and lender consents. The Company and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership are guarantors of the Unsecured Term Loan G. The agreement also contains financial and other covenants substantially similar to the covenants in our unsecured credit facility.\nSame store lease income increased by $3.9 million or 1.9% to $252.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $249.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Approximately $7.4 million of the increase was attributable to rental increases due to new leases and renewals of existing tenants and approximately $0.6 million due to a net decrease in the amortization of net above market leases. This increase was partially offset by an approximately $4.1 million decrease due to a reduction of base rent due to tenants downsizing their spaces and vacancies.\nWe believe that the current economic environment, while challenging, will provide us with an opportunity to demonstrate the diversification of our portfolio. Specifically, we believe our existing portfolio should benefit from competitive rental rates and strong occupancy. In addition to our diversified portfolio, we believe that certain characteristics of our business and capital structure should position us well in an uncertain environment, including the fact that we have minimal floating rate debt exposure (taking into account our hedging activities) and strong liquidity and access to capital, and that many of our competitors for the assets we purchase tend to be smaller local and regional investors who are likely to be more heavily impacted by interest rates and availability of capital.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions Net Operating Income\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSame Store Operating Expenses\nWe are a REIT focused on the acquisition, ownership, and operation of single-tenant, industrial properties throughout the United States. We seek to (i) identify properties that offer relative value across all locations, industrial property types, and tenants through the principled application of our proprietary risk assessment model, (ii) operate our properties in an efficient, cost-effective manner, and (iii) capitalize our business appropriately given the characteristics of our assets. We are a Maryland corporation and our common stock is publicly traded on the NYSE under the symbol STAG.\u201d\n(2)The terms of the loan agreements for the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association CMBS loan calls for a monthly leasing escrow payment of approximately $0.1 million and the balance of the reserve is capped at $2.1 million. The cap was met at December 31, 2020 and the balance at December 31, 2020 was approximately $2.1 million. The funding of these reserves is not included in the table above.\nConditions in Our Markets\nPreferred Stock\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n(1)For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned 492 buildings in 39 states with approximately 98.2 million rentable square feet, consisting of 409 warehouse/distribution buildings, 73 light manufacturing buildings, eight flex/office buildings, one Value Add Portfolio building, and one building classified as held for sale. We own both single- and multi-tenant properties, although we focus on the former.\nDecember 31, 2019 and 2018, the buildings sold after December 31, 2017 contributed approximately $(0.7) million and $13.3 million to NOI, respectively. Refer to Note 3 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding buildings acquired or sold.\nWe calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating buildings, impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and fair market value of debt adjustment) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nWe are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, and generally are not subject to federal income tax to the extent we currently distribute our income to our stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. We remain subject to state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.\nTotal other expenses consist of general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, loss on impairments, and other expenses.\nSame Store Total Operating Revenue\nThe respective note purchase agreements additionally contain a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00.\nSame store other billings increased by $1.3 million or 2.3% to $55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in other billings for insurance and other certain expenses of $1.1 million due to increased occupancy at certain buildings. The increase was also attributable to an increase in real estate taxes levied by the taxing authority and changes to lease terms where we began paying the real estate taxes and operating expenses on behalf of tenants that had previously paid its taxes and operating expenses directly to respective vendors of approximately $0.2 million.\n\n\nTotal other expenses consist of general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, loss on impairments, and other expenses.\nOur other assets include our flex/office buildings, Value Add Portfolio, buildings classified as held for sale, and Operating Portfolio buildings with expansions placed in service or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2017. Other NOI also includes termination income from buildings from our same store portfolio.\nWe pay quarterly cumulative dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock at a rate equivalent to the fixed annual rate of $1.71875 per share, respectively. The following table summarizes the dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOur business could be impacted in multiple ways due to inflation. We believe, however, that we are well positioned to be able to manage our business in an inflationary environment. Specifically, as of December 31, 2020 our weighted average lease term was approximately 5.2 years and, on average, approximately 8-13% of our total annualized base rental revenue will roll annually over the next few years. We expect that this lease roll will allows us to capture inflationary increases in rent on a relatively efficient basis. In addition, as of December 31, 2020 we have long term liabilities averaging approximately 3.4 years when excluding our unsecured credit facility. Our variable rate debt as of December 31, 2020 has been fully swapped to fixed rates through maturity with the exception of our unsecured credit facility. Therefore, as rents rise and increase our operating cash flow, this positive impact will flow more directly to the bottom line without the offset of higher in place debt costs. Lastly, while inflation will likely lead to increases in the operating costs of our portfolio, such as real estate taxes, utility expenses, and other operating expenses, the majority of our leases are either triple net leases or otherwise provide for tenant reimbursement for costs related to these expenses. Therefore, the increased costs in an inflationary environment would generally be passed through to our tenant.\nRevenue Recognition\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019\n(1)For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $715.4 million to $1,222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $507.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash paid for the acquisition of 69 buildings during the year ended December 31, 2019 of approximately $1,203.4 million, compared to the acquisition of 53 buildings during the year ended December 31, 2018 of approximately $675.6 million. The increase is also attributable to a decrease in net proceeds from the sale of nine buildings and two land parcels during the year ended December 31, 2019 for net proceeds of approximately $42.0 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 where we sold 19 buildings for net proceeds of approximately $207.9 million.\n\n\u2022a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than 0.60:1.00;\n\nOn January 11, 2021, our board of directors declared the Series C Preferred Stock dividend for the quarter ending March 31, 2021 at a quarterly rate of $0.4296875 per share.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $674.7 million to $978.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $303.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net cash inflow on our unsecured credit facility of approximately $216.0 million and an increase in proceeds from sales of common\nThe following discussion of our results of our same store (as defined below) net operating income ( NOI\u201d) should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below. Same store results are considered to be useful to investors in evaluating our performance because they provide information relating to changes in building-level operating performance without taking into account the effects of acquisitions or dispositions. We encourage the reader to not only look at our same store results, but also our total portfolio results, due to historic and future growth.\n(3)The total payments do not include unamortized deferred financing fees, debt issuance costs, or fair market value premiums associated with certain loans.\nSame store other income decreased by $0.5 million or 55.8% to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is primarily the result of income received during the year ended December 31, 2018 for settlements or other sums received from former tenants which did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTotal net other income decreased $70.6 million or 301.6% to $47.2 million total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $23.4 million total other income for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is primarily the result of an decrease in the gain on the sales of rental property, net of approximately $64.8 million. This decrease is also attributable to an increase in interest expense of approximately $5.8 million which was primarily attributable to the funding of unsecured term loans on March 28, 2018, July 27, 2018, July 25, 2019, and December 18, 2019, and the funding of unsecured notes on June 13, 2018.\nOur portfolio continues to benefit from historically low availability throughout the national industrial market. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused both positive and negative impacts at varying levels across different industries and geographies. Ultimately, the acceleration in e-commerce brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken by federal and state governments and the Federal Reserve in response to the pandemic, and the recent economic recovery has helped industrial space demand remain strong as the national availability rate remains stable. We believe that the diversification of our portfolio by market, tenant industry, and tenant credit will prove to be a strength in this environment. Industrial development continues to be concentrated in the larger primary markets, and after a brief deceleration is expected to regain pre-COVID pandemic momentum. We have limited exposure to many of the most active development markets. We will continue to monitor the supply and demand fundamentals for industrial real estate and assess its impact on our business.\n\n(4)The capacity of the unsecured credit facility is $500.0 million. The initial maturity date is January 15, 2023, which may be extended pursuant to two six-month extension options exercisable at our discretion upon advance written notice. Exercise of each six-month option is subject to the following conditions: (i) absence of a default immediately before the extension and immediately after giving effect to the extension, (ii) accuracy of representations and warranties as of the extension date (both immediately before and after the extension), as if made on the extension date, and (iii) payment of a fee.\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our acquisitions and dispositions NOI to net income, see the table above.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1,082.0 million of variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2020, all of our outstanding variable rate debt, with exception of our unsecured credit facility, was fixed with interest rate swaps through maturity. To the extent interest rates increase, interest costs on our floating rate debt not fixed with interest rate swaps will increase, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our security holders. From time to time, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts, including swaps, caps and floors. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amounts third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.\nTotal Other Income (Expense)\nAt December 31, 2020 we owned eight flex/office buildings consisting of approximately 0.4 million square feet, one building in our Value Add Portfolio consisting of approximately 0.1 million square feet, one building classified as held for sale consisting of approximately 20,000 square feet, and eight buildings consisting of approximately 2.0 million square feet that were Operating Portfolio buildings with expansions placed in service or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2018. These buildings contributed approximately $7.4 million and $4.4 million to NOI for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, there was $1.0 million and $0.2 million of termination, solar, and other income adjustments from certain buildings in our same store portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nHowever, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our buildings that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our buildings, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTotal other expenses increased $29.5 million or 12.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $262.4 million compared to $232.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This is primarily a result of an increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $29.3 million as a result of acquisitions that increased the depreciable asset base. Additionally, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $4.1 million primarily due to increases in compensation and other payroll costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $4.2 million in loss on impairments as discussed in Note 3 of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\n(2)We define weighted average lease term as the contractual lease term in years, assuming that tenants exercise no renewal options, purchase options, or early termination rights, weighted by square footage.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nOur ability to increase revenues or cash flow will depend in part on our (i) external growth, specifically acquisition activity, and (ii) internal growth, specifically occupancy and rental rates on our portfolio. A variety of other factors, including those noted below, also affect our future results of operations.\nWe own our interests in all of our properties and conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership. We are the sole member of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2020, we owned approximately 98.0% of the common units of our Operating Partnership, and our current and former executive officers, directors, senior employees and their affiliates, and third parties who contributed properties to us in exchange for common units in our Operating Partnership, owned the remaining 2.0%.\nRental income recognition commences when the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased space and the leased space is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. In order to determine whether the leased space is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, we determine whether we or the tenant own the tenant improvements. When it is determined that we are the owner of the tenant improvements, rental income recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the finished space, which is generally when our owned tenant improvements are completed. In instances when it is determined that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements, rental income recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased space.\nUnsecured Credit Facility, Unsecured Term Loans, and Unsecured Notes\nWe regularly pursue new financing opportunities to ensure an appropriate balance sheet position. As a result of these dedicated efforts, we are confident in our ability to meet future debt maturities and building acquisition funding needs. We believe that our current balance sheet is in an adequate position at the date of this filing, despite possible volatility in the credit markets.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019\nTotal Other Expenses\nOutlook\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our other NOI to net income, see the table above.\nTotal same store operating expenses increased by $0.7 million or 1.1% to $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily related to increases in real estate taxes levied by the applicable taxing authority and changes to lease terms where we began paying the real estate taxes on behalf of tenants that had previously paid the taxes directly to the taxing authority of approximately $1.0 million, as well as an increase in repairs and maintenance expense and insurance expense of approximately $0.7 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in snow removal expense of approximately $0.8 million and a decrease in utility expense of $0.2 million.\nNet income for our total portfolio increased by $156.1 million or 308.2% to $206.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $50.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(1)We define Total Costs as the costs for improvements of vacant and renewal spaces, as well as the contingent-based legal fees and commissions for leasing transactions. Total Costs per square foot represent the total costs expected to be incurred on the leases that commenced during the period and do not reflect actual expenditures for the period.\nSee Note 2 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. For the definitions of certain terms used in the following discussion, refer to Item 1, Business - Certain Definitions\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our other NOI to net income, see the table above.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, on February 5, 2021, we entered into (i) an amendment to the unsecured credit facility (the Credit Facility Amendment\u201d) and (ii) an amendment to the Unsecured Term Loan G (the Amendment to Unsecured Term Loan G\u201d). The Credit Facility Amendment provides for an increase in the aggregate commitments available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility from $500 million to up to $750 million. Other than the increase in the borrowing commitments, the material terms of the unsecured credit facility remain unchanged. The Amendment to Unsecured Term Loan G provides for an extension of the maturity date to February 5, 2026 and a reduced stated interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus a spread that ranges from 0.85% to 1.65% for LIBOR borrowings based on our debt ratings. The Amendment to Unsecured Term Loan G also amended the provision for a minimum interest rate, or floor, for LIBOR borrowings to 0.00%. As of February 5, 2021, borrowings under the Unsecured Term Loan G bore interest at LIBOR plus 1.00%. We previously entered into interest rate swaps to fix LIBOR on the Unsecured Term Loan G at 1.17% and, effective March 19, 2021, at 0.28% through April 18, 2023. Other than the maturity and interest rate provisions described above, the material terms of the Unsecured Term Loan G remain unchanged.\nSame store lease income increased by $1.9 million or 0.7% to $298.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $296.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Approximately $10.0 million of the increase was attributable to rental increases due to new leases and renewals of existing tenants and approximately $0.1 million due to a net decrease in the amortization of net above market leases. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of rental income of approximately $3.2 million at properties where we determined that the future collectability of revenue was not reasonably assured, and accordingly, we converted to the cash basis of accounting for the leases and reversed any accounts receivable and accrued rent balances into rental income and did not recognize revenue for payments that were not received from the tenants. Additionally, the increase was partially offset by an approximately $5.0 million decrease due to a reduction of base rent due to tenants downsizing their spaces and vacancies.\nRental Income\n\u2022the rise of e-commerce (as compared to the traditional retail store distribution model) and the concomitant demand by e-commerce industry participants for well-located, functional distribution space;\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding preferred stock issuances as of December 31, 2020.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have worked to ensure that we maintain adequate liquidity. On April 17, 2020, we paid in full the amounts outstanding under our Unsecured Term Loan B and the Unsecured Term Loan C with proceeds from our new Unsecured Term Loan G, as discussed in Indebtedness Outstanding\u201d below. As of December 31, 2020, we had total immediate liquidity of approximately $405.7 million, comprised of $15.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $390.0 million of immediate availability on our unsecured credit facility. When incorporating the remaining undrawn balance available on our unsecured credit facility and the approximately $139.3 million of forward equity proceeds available to us at our option through November 16, 2021, our total liquidity as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $545.0 million.\nWe believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied through cash flows generated by operations, disposition proceeds, and financing activities. Operating cash flow is primarily rental income, expense recoveries from tenants, and other income from operations and is our principal source of funds that we use to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures, and the distributions required to maintain our REIT qualification. We look to the capital markets (common equity, preferred equity, and debt) to primarily fund our acquisition activity. We seek to increase cash flows from our properties by maintaining quality standards for our buildings that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. We believe that our revenue, together with proceeds from building sales and debt and equity financings, will continue to provide funds for our short-term and medium-term liquidity needs.\nUsing information available at the time of acquisition, we allocate the purchase price of properties acquired based upon the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which generally consist of land, buildings, tenant improvements, mortgage debt assumed, and deferred leasing intangibles, which includes in-place leases, above market and below market leases, and tenant relationships. The process for determining the allocation to these components requires estimates and assumptions, including rental rates, discount rates and exit capitalization rates, and land value per square foot, as well as available market information. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. The portion of the purchase price that is allocated to above and below market leases is valued based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in-place rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease term plus the term of any bargain renewal options. The purchase price is further allocated to in-place lease values and tenant relationships based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and its overall relationship with the respective tenant.\nOur business is affected by the uncertainty regarding the current COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of policies introduced to neutralize the disease, and the impact of those policies on economic activity. In June 2020, the National Bureau of Economic Research announced that the United States entered into a recession in February 2020. In the third and fourth quarter, certain economic measurements show that the U.S. economy is recovering. The ultimate shape of the recovery will depend on many factors, including the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. While there has been a negative impact to our tenants, we believe we will continue to benefit from having a well-diversified portfolio across various markets, tenant industries, and lease terms. Additionally, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating a number of trends that positively impact industrial demand.\nCommon Stock\nNet Income\nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases will impact our results of operations and is affected by economic and competitive conditions in our markets and by the desirability of our individual buildings. Leases that comprise approximately 8.4% of our total annualized base rental revenue will expire during the period from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, excluding month-to-month leases. We assume, based upon internal renewal probability estimates, that some of our tenants will renew and others will vacate and the associated space will be re-let subject to downtime assumptions. Using the aforementioned assumptions, we expect that the rental rates on the respective new leases will generally be the same as the rates under existing leases expiring during the period January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, thereby resulting in approximately the same revenue from the same space.\nOur interest rate exposure as it relates to interest expense payments on our floating rate debt is managed through our use of interest rate swaps, which fix the rate of our long term floating rate debt. For a detailed discussion on our use of interest rate swaps, see Interest Rate Risk\u201d below.\nManagement uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs. FFO may be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs.\nOur unsecured credit facility, unsecured term loans, unsecured notes, and mortgage notes are subject to ongoing compliance with a number of financial and other covenants. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the applicable financial covenants.\n\nWe determined that for all leases where we are the lessor, that the timing and pattern of transfer of the non-lease components and associated lease components are the same, and that the lease components, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease. Accordingly, we have made an accounting policy election to recognize the combined component in accordance with Topic 842 as rental income on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table summarizes our debt capital structure as of December 31, 2020.\nOur long-term liquidity needs, in addition to recurring short-term liquidity needs as discussed above, consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, non-recurring capital expenditures, and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through cash flow from operations, the issuance of equity or debt securities, other borrowings, property dispositions, or, in connection with acquisitions of certain additional buildings, the issuance of common units in the Operating Partnership.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect acceleration in a number of industrial specific trends to support stronger long-term demand, including:\nResults of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2020, our buildings were approximately 96.9% leased to 444 tenants, with no single tenant accounting for more than approximately 3.8% of our total annualized base rental revenue and no single industry accounting for more than approximately 12.4% of our total annualized base rental revenue.\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our same store portfolio operating expenses to net income, see the table above.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions Net Operating Income\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nSame store total operating revenue consists primarily of rental income consisting of (i) fixed lease payments, variable lease payments, straight-line rental income, and above and below market lease amortization from our properties ( lease income\u201d), and (ii) other tenant billings for insurance, real estate taxes and certain other expenses ( other billings\u201d).\nWe capitalize costs directly and indirectly related to the development, pre-development, redevelopment, or improvement of rental property. Real estate taxes, compensation costs of development personnel, insurance, interest, and other directly related costs during construction periods are capitalized as incurred, with depreciation commencing with the date the property is substantially completed. Such costs begin to be capitalized to the development projects from the point we are undergoing the necessary activities to get the development project ready for its intended use and cease when the development projects are substantially completed and held available for occupancy. Interest is capitalized based on actual capital expenditures from the period when development or redevelopment commences until the asset is ready for its intended use, at the weighted average borrowing rate of our unsecured indebtedness during the period.\n\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nUse of Derivative Financial Instruments\nSame store total operating revenue consists primarily of rental income consisting of (i) fixed lease payments, variable lease payments, straight-line rental income, and above and below market lease amortization from our properties ( lease income\u201d), and (ii) other tenant billings for insurance, real estate taxes and certain other expenses ( other billings\u201d).\nThe following table summarizes a reconciliation of our NOI for the periods presented to net income, the nearest GAAP equivalent.\nAll current leases are classified as operating leases and rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease (and expected bargain renewal terms or assumed exercise of early termination options) when collectability is reasonably assured. Differences between rental income earned and amounts due under the lease are charged or credited, as applicable, to accrued rental income.\nFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, and we believe that to understand our performance further, FFO should be compared with our reported net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\u2022a maximum secured leverage ratio of not greater than 0.40:1.00;\n(2)The unsecured term loans have a stated interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 1.0%, with the exception of the Unsecured Term Loan G which has a spread of 1.5% and is subject to a minimum rate for LIBOR of 0.25%. As of December 31, 2020, one-month LIBOR for the Unsecured Term Loans A, D, E, F, and G was swapped to a fixed rate of 2.38%, 1.85%, 2.92%, 2.11%, and 1.17%, respectively. One-month LIBOR for the Unsecured Term Loan G will be swapped to a fixed rate of 0.28% effective March 19, 2021.\nIncentive and Equity-Based Employee Compensation Plans\n\u2022a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio of not greater than 0.60:1.00;\n(1)We define Net Debt as our amounts outstanding under our unsecured credit facility, unsecured term loans, unsecured notes, and mortgage notes, less cash and cash equivalents. We define Real Estate Cost Basis as the book value of rental property and deferred leasing intangibles, exclusive of the related accumulated depreciation and amortization.\nNet Operating Income\nThe excess of the cost of an acquired business over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Our goodwill of approximately $4.9 million represents amounts allocated to the assembled workforce from the acquired management company, and is presented in prepaid expenses and other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our goodwill has an indeterminate life and is not amortized, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis at December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We take a qualitative approach to consider whether an impairment of goodwill exists prior to quantitatively determining the fair value of the reporting unit in step one of the impairment test. We have recorded no impairments to goodwill as of December 31, 2020.\nFor properties classified as held for sale, we cease depreciating and amortizing the rental property and value the rental property at the lower of depreciated and amortized cost or fair value less costs to dispose. We present those properties classified as held for sale with any qualifying assets and liabilities associated with those properties as held for sale in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe record all derivatives on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.\nWe evaluate cash basis versus accrual basis of rental income recognition based on the collectability of future lease payments.\n\u2022the overall quality of the transportation infrastructure in the United States.\nIn determining the fair value of the debt assumed, we discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on mortgage debt based on a current market rate. The associated fair market value debt adjustment is amortized through interest expense over the life of the debt on a basis which approximates the effective interest method.\nTotal other income (expense) consists of interest and other income, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on involuntary conversion, and gain on the sales of rental property, net. Interest expense includes interest incurred during the period as well as adjustments related to amortization of financing fees and debt issuance costs, and amortization of fair market value adjustments associated with the assumption of debt.\nTotal same store expenses increased by $1.8 million or 3.4% to $55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $53.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily related to increases in real estate taxes levied by the related taxing authority and changes to lease terms where we began paying the real estate taxes on behalf of tenants that had previously paid its taxes directly to the taxing authority of approximately $3.1 million, as well as an increase in snow removal and other expenses of approximately $0.6 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in insurance expenses of approximately $1.4 million and a decrease in repairs and maintenance and utility expenses of $0.5 million.\nThe following table summarizes certain information with respect to the indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nTotal other income (expense) consists of interest and other income, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, and gain on the sales of rental property, net. Interest expense includes interest incurred during the period as well as adjustments related to amortization of financing fees and debt issuance costs, and amortization of fair market value adjustments associated with the assumption of debt.\n(6)The weighted average interest rate was calculated using the fixed interest rate swapped on the current notional amount of $975.0 million of debt, and was not adjusted to include the amortization of deferred financing fees or debt issuance costs incurred in obtaining debt or any unamortized fair market value premiums.\nIn the first half of 2020, the U.S. federal and state governments, as well as the Federal Reserve, responded to the profoundly uncertain outlook with a series of policies to ease the economic burden of COVID-19 closures on businesses and individuals. The major U.S. congressional policy action known as the Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, allocated $2 trillion in federal aid to specific industries, small businesses and individuals. The Federal Reserve also took major actions including the completion of two emergency fed funds rate cuts in March 2020 to a range between 0% to 0.25%, which resulted in added liquidity to the bond market, establishing new lending facilities, and expanding its bond buying program to include mortgage backed securities, investment grade corporate debt, and high yield corporate exchange-traded funds. In the fourth quarter, due to surging COVID-19 cases in the United States, certain economic lockdown measures returned, and pressure on certain businesses renewed. In addition, in November 2020, the U.S. elections resulted in the Democratic party taking control of the Presidency and Congress. The new Biden administration entered office in January 2021 on the heels of the first phase of U.S. vaccine distribution and of a newly passed, $900 billion COVID-19 relief bill to further support businesses and individuals. We expect supportive fiscal and monetary policy to continue under the Biden administration as needed.\nThe unsecured credit facility provides for a facility fee payable by us to the lenders at a rate per annum of 0.125% to 0.3%, depending on our debt rating, as defined in the credit agreement, of the aggregate commitments (currently $500.0 million). The facility fee is due and payable quarterly.\nAt December 31, 2019 we owned eight flex/office buildings consisting of approximately 0.4 million square feet, six buildings in our Value Add Portfolio consisting of approximately 1.4 million square feet, two buildings classified as held for sale consisting of approximately 0.7 million square feet, and six buildings consisting of approximately 1.6 million square feet that were Operating Portfolio buildings with expansions placed in service or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2017. These buildings contributed approximately $9.7 million and $10.0 million to NOI for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Additionally, there was $0.1 million and $(0.2) million of termination, solar, and other income adjustments from certain buildings in our same store portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nSame store rental income, which is comprised of lease income and other billings as discussed below, increased by $6.3 million or 2.2% to $299.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $293.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our same store total operating revenue to net income, see the table above.\nThe above and below market lease values are amortized into rental income over the remaining lease term. The value of in-place lease intangibles and tenant relationships are amortized over the remaining lease term (and expected renewal period of the respective lease for tenant relationships) as increases to depreciation and amortization expense. The remaining lease terms are adjusted for bargain renewal options or assumed exercises of early termination options, as applicable. If a tenant subsequently terminates its lease, any unamortized portion of above and below market leases is accelerated into rental income and the in-place lease value and tenant relationships are accelerated into depreciation and amortization expense over the shortened lease term.\nThe aggregate undrawn nominal commitments on the unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loans as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $390.0 million, including issued letters of credit. Our actual borrowing capacity at any given point in time may be less and is restricted to a maximum amount based on our debt covenant compliance.\nWhile we did not incur significant disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2020, a number of our tenants requested rent deferral or rent abatement as a result of the pandemic. In response to such requests, we entered into rent deferral agreement with certain tenants during the year ended December 31, 2020, which resulted in approximately $2.1 million of rent deferrals during the year ended December 31, 2020. We will continue to evaluate tenant rent relief requests on an individual basis, considering a number of factors. Not all tenant requests will ultimately result in modified agreements, nor are we foregoing our contractual rights under our lease agreements.\n\n\n\u2022a minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio of not less than or equal to 1.75:1.00.\nWe recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of equity. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value and the changes in fair value must be reflected as income or expense.\nTotal net other income increased $122.3 million or 259.3% to $75.2 million total other income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $47.2 million total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is primarily the result of an increase in the gain on the sales of rental property, net of $128.3 million, as well as an increase in gain on involuntary conversion of $2.2 million. Additionally, there was an increase of approximately $0.4 million in interest and other income due to an increased cash and cash equivalents balance during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. These increases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense of approximately $7.7 million which was primarily attributable to the funding of unsecured term loans on March 25, 2020, December 18, 2019, and July 25, 2019. Additionally, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 that was primarily related to the refinance of the Unsecured Term Loan B and the Unsecured Term Loan C on April 17, 2020, as discussed in Note 4 of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFinancial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, tenant accounts receivable, interest rate swaps, accounts payable, accrued expenses, unsecured credit facility, unsecured term loans, unsecured notes, and mortgage notes. See Note 4 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the fair value of our indebtedness. See Note 5 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the fair value of our interest rate swaps.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had letters of credit related to development projects and certain other agreements of approximately $3.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had no other material off-balance sheet arrangements. See the table under Liquidity and Capital Resources-Contractual Obligations\u201d above for information regarding certain off-balance sheet arrangements.\nNet Income\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nOn January 11, 2021, our board of directors declared the common stock dividends for the months ending January 31, 2021, February 28, 2021 and March 31, 2021 at a monthly rate of $0.120833 per share of common stock.\nIndebtedness Outstanding\nCovenants: Our ability to borrow, maintain borrowings and avoid default under the unsecured credit facility, the unsecured term loans, and unsecured notes is subject to our ongoing compliance with a number of financial covenants, including:\nThe following table summarizes our Operating Portfolio leases that commenced during the year ended December 31, 2020. Certain leases contain rental concessions; any such rental concessions are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our same store total operating revenue to net income, see the table above.\nSame Store Total Operating Revenue\nOther Net Operating Income\nOn November 16, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of an aggregate of 8,000,000 shares of common stock offered by the forward dealer in connection with certain forward sale agreements at a price to the underwriters of $30.02 per share. On December 15, 2020, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 1,200,000 shares for an offering price of $29.90 per share. The offering closed on November 19, 2020 and the underwriters' option closed on December 17, 2020. On December 23, 2020, we partially settled the forward sales agreements by issuing 4,518,077 shares of common stock and received net proceeds of approximately $135.0 million. Subject to our right to elect cash or net share settlement, we have the ability to settle the remaining forward sales agreements at any time through scheduled maturity date of the forward sale agreements of November 16, 2021.\nPursuant to the terms of our unsecured debt agreements, we may not pay distributions that exceed the minimum amount required for us to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT if a default or event of default occurs and is continuing.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $60.6 million to $293.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $233.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to incremental operating cash flows from property acquisitions completed after December 31, 2019, and operating performance at existing properties. These increases were partially offset by the loss of cash flows from property dispositions completed after December 31, 2019 and fluctuations in working capital due to timing of payments and rental receipts.\nThe Series C Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to dividend rights and rights upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs. The Series C Preferred Stock has no stated maturity date and is not subject to mandatory redemption or any sinking fund. Generally, we are not permitted to redeem the Series C Preferred Stock prior to March 17, 2021, except in limited circumstances relating to our ability to qualify as a REIT and in certain other circumstances related to a change of control.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, specifically our obligations under long-term debt agreements and ground lease agreements.\nFunds From Operations\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our same store portfolio operating expenses to net income, see the table above.\nDepreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives.", "item_7_text": "We adopted fair value measurement provisions for our financial instruments recorded at fair value. The guidance establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nInflation\nSame store operating expenses consist primarily of property operating expenses and real estate taxes and insurance.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic or a future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of infectious disease affecting states or regions in which we or our tenants operate could have material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and\nThe swaps outlined in the above table were all designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, and all are valued as Level 2 financial instruments. Level 2 financial instruments are defined as significant other observable inputs. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of all of our 24 interest rate swaps were in a liability position of approximately $40.7 million, including any adjustment for nonperformance risk related to these agreements.\nEquity\ncash flows due to, among other factors: health or other government authorities requiring the closure of offices or other businesses or instituting quarantines of personnel as the result of, or in order to avoid, exposure to a contagious disease; disruption in supply and delivery chains; a general decline in business activity and demand for real estate; reduced economic activity, general economic decline or recession, which may impact our tenants' businesses, financial condition and liquidity and may cause one or more of our tenants to be unable to make rent payments to us timely, or at all, or to otherwise seek modifications of lease obligations; difficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions, which may affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis; and the potential negative impact on the health of our personnel, particularly if a significant number of our employees are impacted, which would result in a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during a disruption.\n(5)The initial maturity date is April 16, 2021, which may be extended pursuant to two one-year extension options exercisable at our discretion upon advance written notice. Exercise of each one-year option is subject to the following conditions: (i) absence of a default immediately before the extension and immediately after giving effect to the extension, (ii) accuracy of representations and warranties as of the extension date (both immediately before and after the extension), as if made on the extension date, and (iii) payment of a fee. Neither extension option is subject to lender consent, assuming proper notice and satisfaction of the conditions. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Unsecured Term Loan G was amended, as discussed below.\n\n(1)From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments, such as maintenance agreements at our buildings. Such contracts, in the aggregate, do not represent material obligations, are typically short-term and cancellable within 90 days and are not included in the table above.\nThe purchase price allocated to deferred leasing intangible assets are included in rental property, net on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and the purchase price allocated to deferred leasing intangible liabilities are included in deferred leasing intangibles, net on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets under the liabilities section.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSame store other billings increased by $2.5 million or 5.6% to $46.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $44.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in real estate taxes levied by the taxing authority and changes to lease terms where we began paying the real estate taxes and operating expenses on behalf of tenants that had previously paid its taxes and operating expenses directly to respective vendors of approximately $2.8 million. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $0.3 million related to tenant specific billings that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 that did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nCritical Accounting Policies\nTotal Other Expenses\nWe consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income (loss) because we believe it helps investors and management understand the core operations of our buildings. NOI is defined as rental income, which includes billings for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, less property expenses. NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our financial performance since it excludes expenses which could materially impact our results of operations. Further, our NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating NOI.\n(1)Interest rate as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the one-month LIBOR ( L\u201d) was 0.1439%. The interest rate is not adjusted to include the amortization of deferred financing fees or debt issuance costs incurred in obtaining debt or any unamortized fair market value premiums. The spread over the applicable rate for our unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loans is based on our debt rating, as defined in the respective loan agreements.\nBorrower and Guarantors: The Operating Partnership is the borrower under the unsecured credit facility, the unsecured term loans and is the issuer of the unsecured notes. STAG Industrial, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries guarantee the obligations under our unsecured debt agreements.\nWe define same store properties as properties that were in the Operating Portfolio for the entirety of the comparative periods presented. The results for same store properties exclude termination fees, solar income, and revenue associated with one-time tenant reimbursements of capital expenditures. Same store properties exclude Operating Portfolio properties with expansions placed into service or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2018. On December 31, 2020, we owned 364 industrial buildings consisting of approximately 71.7 million square feet, which represents approximately 73.0% of our total portfolio, that are considered our same store portfolio in the analysis below. Same store occupancy increased approximately 0.4% to 96.4% as of December 31, 2020 compared to 96.0% as of December 31, 2019.\nScheduled Lease Expirations\nRefer to Note 3 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding buildings acquired or sold.\nNet income for our total portfolio decreased by $45.6 million or 47.4% to $50.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOur property operating expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, management fees, insurance, and site repair and maintenance costs. For the majority of our tenants, our property operating expenses are controlled, in part, by the triple net provisions in tenant leases. In our triple net leases, the tenant is responsible for all aspects of and costs related to the building and its operation during the lease term, including utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, but typically excluding roof and building structure. However, we also have modified gross leases and gross leases in our building portfolio. The terms of those leases vary and on some occasions we may absorb certain building related expenses of our tenants. In our modified gross leases, we are responsible for some building related expenses during the lease term, but the cost of most of the expenses is passed through to the tenant for reimbursement to us. In our gross leases, we are responsible for all costs related to the building and its operation during the lease term. Our overall performance will be affected by the extent to which we are able to pass-through property operating expenses to our tenants.\nThe Wells Fargo Bank, National Association CMBS loan agreement is a commercial mortgage backed security that provides for a secured loan. There are 24 properties that are collateral for the CMBS loan. The Operating Partnership guarantees the obligations under the CMBS loan.\nWhen we are the owner of tenant improvements or other capital items, the cost to construct the tenant improvements or other capital items, including costs paid for or reimbursed by the tenants, is recorded as capital assets. For these tenant improvements or other capital items, the amount funded by or reimbursed by the tenants are recorded as deferred revenue, which is amortized on a straight-line basis as income over the shorter of the useful life of the capital asset or the term of the related lease.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $709.4 million to $269.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $978.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in net cash outflow on our unsecured credit facility of approximately $84.5 million, a decrease in net proceeds from unsecured term loans of $175.0 million, a decrease in proceeds from sales of common stock of approximately $413.9 million, and an increase in dividends paid of $34.7 million.\nFor leases in which we are the lessee, we recognize a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets equal to the present value of the fixed lease payments. In determining operating right-of-use asset and lease liability for our operating leases, we estimate an appropriate incremental borrowing rate on a fully-collateralized basis for the terms of the leases. We utilize a market-based approach to estimate the incremental borrowing rate for each individual lease. Since the terms under our ground leases are significantly longer than the terms of borrowings available to us on a fully-collateralized basis, the estimate of this rate required significant judgment, and considered factors such as yields on outstanding public debt and other market based pricing on longer duration financing instruments.\nThe following table summarizes a reconciliation of our FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders for the periods presented to net income, the nearest GAAP equivalent.\nThe following table summarizes our at-the market ( ATM\u201d) common stock offering program as of December 31, 2020. We may from time to time sell common stock through sales agents under the ATM program. No shares of common stock were sold under the ATM program during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn accordance with fair value measurement guidance, we made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of our derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting arrangements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio. Credit risk is the risk of failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the contract. We minimize the credit risk in our derivative financial instruments by entering into transactions with various high-quality counterparties. Our exposure to credit risk at any point is generally limited to amounts recorded as assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn addition, we require funds for future dividends to be paid to our common and preferred stockholders and common unit holders in our Operating Partnership. These distributions on our common stock are voluntary (at the discretion of our board of directors), to the extent in excess of distribution requirements in order to maintain our REIT status for federal income tax purposes, and the excess portion may be reduced or stopped if needed to fund other liquidity requirements or for other reasons. The following table summarizes the dividends attributable to our common stock that were declared or paid during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe have established criteria for suitable counterparties in relation to various specific types of risk. We only use counterparties that have a credit rating of no lower than investment grade at swap inception from Moody's Investor Services, Standard & Poor's, Fitch Ratings, or other nationally recognized rating agencies.\nWe use interest rate swaps to fix the rate of our variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2020, all of our outstanding variable rate debt, with the exception of our unsecured credit facility, was fixed with interest rate swaps through maturity.\nThe following table summarizes selected operating information for our same store portfolio and our total portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands). The table includes a reconciliation from our same store portfolio to our total portfolio by also providing information for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 with respect to the buildings acquired and disposed of and Operating Portfolio buildings with expansions placed into service or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2017 and our flex/office buildings and Value Add Portfolio and buildings classified as held for sale.\n(4)The initial maturity date of our unsecured credit facility is January 15, 2023, which may be extended pursuant to two six-month extension options exercisable at our discretion upon advance written notice. Exercise of each six-month option is subject to the following conditions: (i) absence of a default immediately before the extension and immediately after giving effect to the extension, (ii) accuracy of representations and warranties as of the extension date (both immediately before and after the extension), as if made on the extension date, and (iii) payment of a fee.\nRental property is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Significant renovations and betterments that extend the economic useful lives of assets are capitalized.\nOther Net Operating Income\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our buildings, including interest expense, interest rate swap payments, scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, funding of property acquisitions under contract, general and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures for tenant improvements and leasing commissions.\nSame store operating expenses consist primarily of property operating expenses and real estate taxes and insurance.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nOn January 13, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of an aggregate of 10,062,500 shares of common stock at a price to the underwriters of $30.9022 per share, consisting of (i) 5,600,000 shares offered directly by us and (ii) 4,462,500 shares offered by the forward dealer in connection with certain forward sale agreements (including 1,312,500 shares offered pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, which option was exercised in full). The offering closed on January 16, 2020 and we received net proceeds from the sale of shares offered directly by us of approximately $173.1 million. On December 23, 2020, we physically settled the forward sales agreements in full by issuing 4,462,500 shares of common stock and received net proceeds of approximately $131.2 million.\nIn this report, we disclose funds from operations ( FFO\u201d) and NOI, which meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures\u201d as set forth in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. As a result, we are required to include in this report a statement of why management believes that presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors.\nOur qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual annual operating results, qualification tests in the federal income tax laws. Those tests involve the percentage of income that we earn from specified sources, the percentage of our assets that falls within specified categories, the diversity of our capital stock ownership and the percentage of our earnings that we distribute.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nOverview\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $35.6 million to $233.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $197.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to incremental operating cash flows from property acquisitions completed after December 31, 2018, and operating performance at existing properties. These increases were partially offset by the loss of cash flows from property dispositions completed after December 31, 2018 and fluctuations in working capital due to timing of payments and rental receipts.\nComparison of year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any other pandemic, epidemic or disease impacts our operations and those of our tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic (or a future pandemic, epidemic or disease) presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nContractual Obligations\noccupancy, rental rates, capital requirements, and exit capitalization rates that could differ from actual results. The discount rate used to present value the cash flows for determining fair value is also subjective.\n\u2022the increasing attractiveness of the United States as a manufacturing and distribution location because of the size of the U.S. consumer market, an increase in overseas labor costs, a desire for greater supply chain resilience and redundancy and the overall cost of supplying and shipping goods (i.e. the shortening and fattening of the supply chain); and\nWe grant equity-based compensation awards to our employees and directors in the form of restricted shares of common stock, LTIP units, and outperformance programs and performance units (outperformance programs and performance units are collectively, the Performance-based Compensation Plans\u201d). See Notes 6, 7 and 8 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of restricted shares of common stock, LTIP units, and Performance-based Compensation Plans, respectively. We measure equity-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date and recognize the expense ratably over the vesting period, and forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nEvents of Default: Our unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loans contain customary events of default, including but not limited to non-payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts, defaults in the compliance with the covenants contained in the documents evidencing the unsecured credit facility and the unsecured term loans, cross-defaults to other material debt and bankruptcy or other insolvency events.\n(6)Amounts include interest rate payments on the $975.0 million current notional amount of our interest rate swaps, as discussed below.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2018, we acquired 110 buildings consisting of approximately 24.0 million square feet (excluding six buildings that were included in the Value Add Portfolio at December 31, 2020 or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2018), and sold 16 buildings and two land parcels consisting of approximately 5.0 million square feet. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the buildings acquired after December 31, 2018 contributed approximately $86.5 million and $27.6 million to NOI, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the buildings sold after December 31, 2018 contributed approximately $7.9 million and $9.7 million to NOI, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes selected operating information for our same store portfolio and our total portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands). This table includes a reconciliation from our same store portfolio to our total portfolio by also providing information for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 with respect to the buildings acquired and disposed of and Operating Portfolio buildings with expansions placed into service or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2018 and our flex/office buildings, Value Add Portfolio, and buildings classified as held for sale.\nOur other assets include our flex/office buildings, Value Add Portfolio, buildings classified as held for sale, and Operating Portfolio buildings with expansions placed in service or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2018. Other NOI also includes termination, solar, and other income adjustments from buildings in our same store portfolio.\nTotal Other Income (Expense)\nEarly lease termination fees are recorded in rental income on a straight-line basis from the notification date of such termination to the then remaining (not the original) lease term, if any, or upon collection if collection is not reasonably assured.\nWe evaluate the carrying value of all tangible and intangible rental property assets and deferred leasing intangible liabilities (collectively, the property\u201d) held for use for possible impairment when an event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates their carrying value may not be recoverable. The evaluation includes estimating and reviewing anticipated future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the property. If such cash flows are less than the property's carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent by which the property's carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. Estimating future cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding anticipated hold period, future\nSince March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely harmed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the pandemic continues to evolve and many countries, including the United States, continue to react by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting almost every industry, including the real estate industry and the industries of our tenants, directly or indirectly. The rapid development and fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact the pandemic may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLeases\nSame store rental income, which is comprised of lease income and other billings as discussed below, increased by $3.2 million or 0.9% to $354.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $351.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(3)Represents the total rental concessions for the entire lease term.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2017, we acquired 115 buildings consisting of approximately 25.0 million square feet (excluding seven buildings that were included in the Value Add Portfolio at December 31, 2019 or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2017), and sold 28 buildings and two land parcels consisting of approximately 5.5 million square feet. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the buildings acquired after December 31, 2017 contributed approximately $77.0 million and $18.2 million to NOI, respectively. For the years ended\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\n(3)Prepayment terms consist of (i) pre-payable with no penalty; (ii) pre-payable with penalty; (iii) pre-payable without penalty three months prior to the maturity date, however can be defeased; and (iv) pre-payable without penalty three months prior to the maturity date.\n\n(5)This is not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this report.\nFuture economic downturns or regional downturns affecting our submarkets that impair our ability to renew or re-lease space and the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments, as in the case of tenant bankruptcies, including those brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our buildings. Our ability to lease our properties and the attendant rental rate is dependent upon, among other things, (i) the overall economy, (ii) the supply/demand dynamic in our markets, (iii) the quality of our properties, including age, clear height, and configuration, and (iv) our tenants' ability to meet their contractual obligations to us.\nSame Store Operating Expenses\nGoodwill\nCash Flows\nThe buildings in our portfolio are located in markets throughout the United States. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, new supply, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters and other factors in these markets may affect our overall performance.\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our acquisitions and dispositions NOI to net income, see the table above.\nstock of approximately $466.3 million, as well as an increase in proceeds from unsecured term loans of $125.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. These increases were partially offset by decreases in proceeds from unsecured notes of $175.0 million and an approximately $30.7 million increase in dividends paid during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\u2022a minimum fixed charge ratio of not less than or equal to 1.50:1.00; and\nAdditionally, for the year ended December 31, 2020, leases commenced totaling 879,203 square feet related to the Value Add Portfolio and are excluded from the Operating Portfolio statistics above.\nRental Property and Deferred Leasing Intangibles\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $668.0 million to $554.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1,222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash paid for the acquisition of 48 buildings during the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately $773.3 million, compared to the acquisition of 69 buildings during the year ended December 31, 2019 of approximately $1,203.4 million. The decrease is also attributable to an increase in net proceeds from the sale of seven buildings during the year ended December 31, 2020 for net proceeds of approximately $273.6 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 where we sold nine buildings and two land parcels for net proceeds of approximately $42.0 million.\nWe own the interests in all of our properties and conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership. We are the sole member of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2020, we owned approximately 98.0% of the common equity of our Operating Partnership, and our current and former executive officers, directors, senior employees and their affiliates, and third parties who contributed properties to us in exchange for common equity in our Operating Partnership, owned the remaining 2.0%.\nTotal other expenses increased $23.8 million or 11.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $232.9 million compared to $209.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This is primarily a result of an increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $17.8 million as a result of acquisitions that increased the depreciable asset base, as well as an increase of approximately $3.6 million in loss on impairments. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.9 million primarily due to increases in compensation and other payroll costs.\nWe receive income primarily in the form of rental income from the tenants who occupy our buildings. The amount of rental income generated by the buildings in our portfolio depends principally on occupancy and rental rates.\nOn April 17, 2020, we entered into the $300.0 million Unsecured Term Loan G with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent on behalf of the various lenders under the agreement. In connection with execution of the Unsecured Term Loan G, the Unsecured Term Loan B and Unsecured Term Loan C were paid in full. As of December 31, 2020, the Unsecured Term Loan G bore an interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 1.5% based on our debt rating, as defined in the loan agreement, and subject to a minimum rate for LIBOR of 0.25%. The Unsecured Term Loan G matures on April 16, 2021, subject to two one-year extension options at our discretion, and subject to certain conditions (other than lender discretion) such as the absence of default and the payment of an extension fee. At execution, we intended to exercise both extension options. To exercise the extension options we are required pay a fee equal to (i) 0.15% of the outstanding amount on the effective day of the first extension period and (ii) 0.20% of the outstanding amount on the effective day of the second extension period. The Unsecured Term Loan G has an accordion feature that allows us to increase its borrowing capacity to $600.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and lender consents. The Company and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership are guarantors of the Unsecured Term Loan G. The agreement also contains financial and other covenants substantially similar to the covenants in our unsecured credit facility.\nSame store lease income increased by $3.9 million or 1.9% to $252.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $249.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Approximately $7.4 million of the increase was attributable to rental increases due to new leases and renewals of existing tenants and approximately $0.6 million due to a net decrease in the amortization of net above market leases. This increase was partially offset by an approximately $4.1 million decrease due to a reduction of base rent due to tenants downsizing their spaces and vacancies.\nWe believe that the current economic environment, while challenging, will provide us with an opportunity to demonstrate the diversification of our portfolio. Specifically, we believe our existing portfolio should benefit from competitive rental rates and strong occupancy. In addition to our diversified portfolio, we believe that certain characteristics of our business and capital structure should position us well in an uncertain environment, including the fact that we have minimal floating rate debt exposure (taking into account our hedging activities) and strong liquidity and access to capital, and that many of our competitors for the assets we purchase tend to be smaller local and regional investors who are likely to be more heavily impacted by interest rates and availability of capital.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions Net Operating Income\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSame Store Operating Expenses\nWe are a REIT focused on the acquisition, ownership, and operation of single-tenant, industrial properties throughout the United States. We seek to (i) identify properties that offer relative value across all locations, industrial property types, and tenants through the principled application of our proprietary risk assessment model, (ii) operate our properties in an efficient, cost-effective manner, and (iii) capitalize our business appropriately given the characteristics of our assets. We are a Maryland corporation and our common stock is publicly traded on the NYSE under the symbol STAG.\u201d\n(2)The terms of the loan agreements for the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association CMBS loan calls for a monthly leasing escrow payment of approximately $0.1 million and the balance of the reserve is capped at $2.1 million. The cap was met at December 31, 2020 and the balance at December 31, 2020 was approximately $2.1 million. The funding of these reserves is not included in the table above.\nConditions in Our Markets\nPreferred Stock\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n(1)For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned 492 buildings in 39 states with approximately 98.2 million rentable square feet, consisting of 409 warehouse/distribution buildings, 73 light manufacturing buildings, eight flex/office buildings, one Value Add Portfolio building, and one building classified as held for sale. We own both single- and multi-tenant properties, although we focus on the former.\nDecember 31, 2019 and 2018, the buildings sold after December 31, 2017 contributed approximately $(0.7) million and $13.3 million to NOI, respectively. Refer to Note 3 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding buildings acquired or sold.\nWe calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d). FFO represents GAAP net income (loss), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating buildings, impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and fair market value of debt adjustment) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nWe are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, and generally are not subject to federal income tax to the extent we currently distribute our income to our stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. We remain subject to state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.\nTotal other expenses consist of general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, loss on impairments, and other expenses.\nSame Store Total Operating Revenue\nThe respective note purchase agreements additionally contain a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 1.50:1.00.\nSame store other billings increased by $1.3 million or 2.3% to $55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in other billings for insurance and other certain expenses of $1.1 million due to increased occupancy at certain buildings. The increase was also attributable to an increase in real estate taxes levied by the taxing authority and changes to lease terms where we began paying the real estate taxes and operating expenses on behalf of tenants that had previously paid its taxes and operating expenses directly to respective vendors of approximately $0.2 million.\n\n\nTotal other expenses consist of general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, loss on impairments, and other expenses.\nOur other assets include our flex/office buildings, Value Add Portfolio, buildings classified as held for sale, and Operating Portfolio buildings with expansions placed in service or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2017. Other NOI also includes termination income from buildings from our same store portfolio.\nWe pay quarterly cumulative dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock at a rate equivalent to the fixed annual rate of $1.71875 per share, respectively. The following table summarizes the dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOur business could be impacted in multiple ways due to inflation. We believe, however, that we are well positioned to be able to manage our business in an inflationary environment. Specifically, as of December 31, 2020 our weighted average lease term was approximately 5.2 years and, on average, approximately 8-13% of our total annualized base rental revenue will roll annually over the next few years. We expect that this lease roll will allows us to capture inflationary increases in rent on a relatively efficient basis. In addition, as of December 31, 2020 we have long term liabilities averaging approximately 3.4 years when excluding our unsecured credit facility. Our variable rate debt as of December 31, 2020 has been fully swapped to fixed rates through maturity with the exception of our unsecured credit facility. Therefore, as rents rise and increase our operating cash flow, this positive impact will flow more directly to the bottom line without the offset of higher in place debt costs. Lastly, while inflation will likely lead to increases in the operating costs of our portfolio, such as real estate taxes, utility expenses, and other operating expenses, the majority of our leases are either triple net leases or otherwise provide for tenant reimbursement for costs related to these expenses. Therefore, the increased costs in an inflationary environment would generally be passed through to our tenant.\nRevenue Recognition\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019\n(1)For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $715.4 million to $1,222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $507.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash paid for the acquisition of 69 buildings during the year ended December 31, 2019 of approximately $1,203.4 million, compared to the acquisition of 53 buildings during the year ended December 31, 2018 of approximately $675.6 million. The increase is also attributable to a decrease in net proceeds from the sale of nine buildings and two land parcels during the year ended December 31, 2019 for net proceeds of approximately $42.0 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 where we sold 19 buildings for net proceeds of approximately $207.9 million.\n\n\u2022a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than 0.60:1.00;\n\nOn January 11, 2021, our board of directors declared the Series C Preferred Stock dividend for the quarter ending March 31, 2021 at a quarterly rate of $0.4296875 per share.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $674.7 million to $978.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $303.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net cash inflow on our unsecured credit facility of approximately $216.0 million and an increase in proceeds from sales of common\nThe following discussion of our results of our same store (as defined below) net operating income ( NOI\u201d) should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below. Same store results are considered to be useful to investors in evaluating our performance because they provide information relating to changes in building-level operating performance without taking into account the effects of acquisitions or dispositions. We encourage the reader to not only look at our same store results, but also our total portfolio results, due to historic and future growth.\n(3)The total payments do not include unamortized deferred financing fees, debt issuance costs, or fair market value premiums associated with certain loans.\nSame store other income decreased by $0.5 million or 55.8% to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is primarily the result of income received during the year ended December 31, 2018 for settlements or other sums received from former tenants which did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTotal net other income decreased $70.6 million or 301.6% to $47.2 million total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $23.4 million total other income for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is primarily the result of an decrease in the gain on the sales of rental property, net of approximately $64.8 million. This decrease is also attributable to an increase in interest expense of approximately $5.8 million which was primarily attributable to the funding of unsecured term loans on March 28, 2018, July 27, 2018, July 25, 2019, and December 18, 2019, and the funding of unsecured notes on June 13, 2018.\nOur portfolio continues to benefit from historically low availability throughout the national industrial market. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused both positive and negative impacts at varying levels across different industries and geographies. Ultimately, the acceleration in e-commerce brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken by federal and state governments and the Federal Reserve in response to the pandemic, and the recent economic recovery has helped industrial space demand remain strong as the national availability rate remains stable. We believe that the diversification of our portfolio by market, tenant industry, and tenant credit will prove to be a strength in this environment. Industrial development continues to be concentrated in the larger primary markets, and after a brief deceleration is expected to regain pre-COVID pandemic momentum. We have limited exposure to many of the most active development markets. We will continue to monitor the supply and demand fundamentals for industrial real estate and assess its impact on our business.\n\n(4)The capacity of the unsecured credit facility is $500.0 million. The initial maturity date is January 15, 2023, which may be extended pursuant to two six-month extension options exercisable at our discretion upon advance written notice. Exercise of each six-month option is subject to the following conditions: (i) absence of a default immediately before the extension and immediately after giving effect to the extension, (ii) accuracy of representations and warranties as of the extension date (both immediately before and after the extension), as if made on the extension date, and (iii) payment of a fee.\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our acquisitions and dispositions NOI to net income, see the table above.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1,082.0 million of variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2020, all of our outstanding variable rate debt, with exception of our unsecured credit facility, was fixed with interest rate swaps through maturity. To the extent interest rates increase, interest costs on our floating rate debt not fixed with interest rate swaps will increase, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our security holders. From time to time, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts, including swaps, caps and floors. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amounts third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.\nTotal Other Income (Expense)\nAt December 31, 2020 we owned eight flex/office buildings consisting of approximately 0.4 million square feet, one building in our Value Add Portfolio consisting of approximately 0.1 million square feet, one building classified as held for sale consisting of approximately 20,000 square feet, and eight buildings consisting of approximately 2.0 million square feet that were Operating Portfolio buildings with expansions placed in service or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2018. These buildings contributed approximately $7.4 million and $4.4 million to NOI for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, there was $1.0 million and $0.2 million of termination, solar, and other income adjustments from certain buildings in our same store portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nHowever, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our buildings that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our buildings, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTotal other expenses increased $29.5 million or 12.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $262.4 million compared to $232.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This is primarily a result of an increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $29.3 million as a result of acquisitions that increased the depreciable asset base. Additionally, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $4.1 million primarily due to increases in compensation and other payroll costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $4.2 million in loss on impairments as discussed in Note 3 of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\n(2)We define weighted average lease term as the contractual lease term in years, assuming that tenants exercise no renewal options, purchase options, or early termination rights, weighted by square footage.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nOur ability to increase revenues or cash flow will depend in part on our (i) external growth, specifically acquisition activity, and (ii) internal growth, specifically occupancy and rental rates on our portfolio. A variety of other factors, including those noted below, also affect our future results of operations.\nWe own our interests in all of our properties and conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership. We are the sole member of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2020, we owned approximately 98.0% of the common units of our Operating Partnership, and our current and former executive officers, directors, senior employees and their affiliates, and third parties who contributed properties to us in exchange for common units in our Operating Partnership, owned the remaining 2.0%.\nRental income recognition commences when the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased space and the leased space is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. In order to determine whether the leased space is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, we determine whether we or the tenant own the tenant improvements. When it is determined that we are the owner of the tenant improvements, rental income recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the finished space, which is generally when our owned tenant improvements are completed. In instances when it is determined that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements, rental income recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased space.\nUnsecured Credit Facility, Unsecured Term Loans, and Unsecured Notes\nWe regularly pursue new financing opportunities to ensure an appropriate balance sheet position. As a result of these dedicated efforts, we are confident in our ability to meet future debt maturities and building acquisition funding needs. We believe that our current balance sheet is in an adequate position at the date of this filing, despite possible volatility in the credit markets.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019\nTotal Other Expenses\nOutlook\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our other NOI to net income, see the table above.\nTotal same store operating expenses increased by $0.7 million or 1.1% to $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily related to increases in real estate taxes levied by the applicable taxing authority and changes to lease terms where we began paying the real estate taxes on behalf of tenants that had previously paid the taxes directly to the taxing authority of approximately $1.0 million, as well as an increase in repairs and maintenance expense and insurance expense of approximately $0.7 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in snow removal expense of approximately $0.8 million and a decrease in utility expense of $0.2 million.\nNet income for our total portfolio increased by $156.1 million or 308.2% to $206.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $50.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(1)We define Total Costs as the costs for improvements of vacant and renewal spaces, as well as the contingent-based legal fees and commissions for leasing transactions. Total Costs per square foot represent the total costs expected to be incurred on the leases that commenced during the period and do not reflect actual expenditures for the period.\nSee Note 2 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. For the definitions of certain terms used in the following discussion, refer to Item 1, Business - Certain Definitions\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our other NOI to net income, see the table above.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, on February 5, 2021, we entered into (i) an amendment to the unsecured credit facility (the Credit Facility Amendment\u201d) and (ii) an amendment to the Unsecured Term Loan G (the Amendment to Unsecured Term Loan G\u201d). The Credit Facility Amendment provides for an increase in the aggregate commitments available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility from $500 million to up to $750 million. Other than the increase in the borrowing commitments, the material terms of the unsecured credit facility remain unchanged. The Amendment to Unsecured Term Loan G provides for an extension of the maturity date to February 5, 2026 and a reduced stated interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus a spread that ranges from 0.85% to 1.65% for LIBOR borrowings based on our debt ratings. The Amendment to Unsecured Term Loan G also amended the provision for a minimum interest rate, or floor, for LIBOR borrowings to 0.00%. As of February 5, 2021, borrowings under the Unsecured Term Loan G bore interest at LIBOR plus 1.00%. We previously entered into interest rate swaps to fix LIBOR on the Unsecured Term Loan G at 1.17% and, effective March 19, 2021, at 0.28% through April 18, 2023. Other than the maturity and interest rate provisions described above, the material terms of the Unsecured Term Loan G remain unchanged.\nSame store lease income increased by $1.9 million or 0.7% to $298.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $296.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Approximately $10.0 million of the increase was attributable to rental increases due to new leases and renewals of existing tenants and approximately $0.1 million due to a net decrease in the amortization of net above market leases. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of rental income of approximately $3.2 million at properties where we determined that the future collectability of revenue was not reasonably assured, and accordingly, we converted to the cash basis of accounting for the leases and reversed any accounts receivable and accrued rent balances into rental income and did not recognize revenue for payments that were not received from the tenants. Additionally, the increase was partially offset by an approximately $5.0 million decrease due to a reduction of base rent due to tenants downsizing their spaces and vacancies.\nRental Income\n\u2022the rise of e-commerce (as compared to the traditional retail store distribution model) and the concomitant demand by e-commerce industry participants for well-located, functional distribution space;\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding preferred stock issuances as of December 31, 2020.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have worked to ensure that we maintain adequate liquidity. On April 17, 2020, we paid in full the amounts outstanding under our Unsecured Term Loan B and the Unsecured Term Loan C with proceeds from our new Unsecured Term Loan G, as discussed in Indebtedness Outstanding\u201d below. As of December 31, 2020, we had total immediate liquidity of approximately $405.7 million, comprised of $15.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $390.0 million of immediate availability on our unsecured credit facility. When incorporating the remaining undrawn balance available on our unsecured credit facility and the approximately $139.3 million of forward equity proceeds available to us at our option through November 16, 2021, our total liquidity as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $545.0 million.\nWe believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied through cash flows generated by operations, disposition proceeds, and financing activities. Operating cash flow is primarily rental income, expense recoveries from tenants, and other income from operations and is our principal source of funds that we use to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures, and the distributions required to maintain our REIT qualification. We look to the capital markets (common equity, preferred equity, and debt) to primarily fund our acquisition activity. We seek to increase cash flows from our properties by maintaining quality standards for our buildings that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. We believe that our revenue, together with proceeds from building sales and debt and equity financings, will continue to provide funds for our short-term and medium-term liquidity needs.\nUsing information available at the time of acquisition, we allocate the purchase price of properties acquired based upon the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which generally consist of land, buildings, tenant improvements, mortgage debt assumed, and deferred leasing intangibles, which includes in-place leases, above market and below market leases, and tenant relationships. The process for determining the allocation to these components requires estimates and assumptions, including rental rates, discount rates and exit capitalization rates, and land value per square foot, as well as available market information. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. The portion of the purchase price that is allocated to above and below market leases is valued based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in-place rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease term plus the term of any bargain renewal options. The purchase price is further allocated to in-place lease values and tenant relationships based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and its overall relationship with the respective tenant.\nOur business is affected by the uncertainty regarding the current COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of policies introduced to neutralize the disease, and the impact of those policies on economic activity. In June 2020, the National Bureau of Economic Research announced that the United States entered into a recession in February 2020. In the third and fourth quarter, certain economic measurements show that the U.S. economy is recovering. The ultimate shape of the recovery will depend on many factors, including the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. While there has been a negative impact to our tenants, we believe we will continue to benefit from having a well-diversified portfolio across various markets, tenant industries, and lease terms. Additionally, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating a number of trends that positively impact industrial demand.\nCommon Stock\nNet Income\nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases will impact our results of operations and is affected by economic and competitive conditions in our markets and by the desirability of our individual buildings. Leases that comprise approximately 8.4% of our total annualized base rental revenue will expire during the period from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, excluding month-to-month leases. We assume, based upon internal renewal probability estimates, that some of our tenants will renew and others will vacate and the associated space will be re-let subject to downtime assumptions. Using the aforementioned assumptions, we expect that the rental rates on the respective new leases will generally be the same as the rates under existing leases expiring during the period January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, thereby resulting in approximately the same revenue from the same space.\nOur interest rate exposure as it relates to interest expense payments on our floating rate debt is managed through our use of interest rate swaps, which fix the rate of our long term floating rate debt. For a detailed discussion on our use of interest rate swaps, see Interest Rate Risk\u201d below.\nManagement uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs. FFO may be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs.\nOur unsecured credit facility, unsecured term loans, unsecured notes, and mortgage notes are subject to ongoing compliance with a number of financial and other covenants. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the applicable financial covenants.\n\nWe determined that for all leases where we are the lessor, that the timing and pattern of transfer of the non-lease components and associated lease components are the same, and that the lease components, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease. Accordingly, we have made an accounting policy election to recognize the combined component in accordance with Topic 842 as rental income on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table summarizes our debt capital structure as of December 31, 2020.\nOur long-term liquidity needs, in addition to recurring short-term liquidity needs as discussed above, consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, non-recurring capital expenditures, and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through cash flow from operations, the issuance of equity or debt securities, other borrowings, property dispositions, or, in connection with acquisitions of certain additional buildings, the issuance of common units in the Operating Partnership.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect acceleration in a number of industrial specific trends to support stronger long-term demand, including:\nResults of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2020, our buildings were approximately 96.9% leased to 444 tenants, with no single tenant accounting for more than approximately 3.8% of our total annualized base rental revenue and no single industry accounting for more than approximately 12.4% of our total annualized base rental revenue.\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our same store portfolio operating expenses to net income, see the table above.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions Net Operating Income\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nSame store total operating revenue consists primarily of rental income consisting of (i) fixed lease payments, variable lease payments, straight-line rental income, and above and below market lease amortization from our properties ( lease income\u201d), and (ii) other tenant billings for insurance, real estate taxes and certain other expenses ( other billings\u201d).\nWe capitalize costs directly and indirectly related to the development, pre-development, redevelopment, or improvement of rental property. Real estate taxes, compensation costs of development personnel, insurance, interest, and other directly related costs during construction periods are capitalized as incurred, with depreciation commencing with the date the property is substantially completed. Such costs begin to be capitalized to the development projects from the point we are undergoing the necessary activities to get the development project ready for its intended use and cease when the development projects are substantially completed and held available for occupancy. Interest is capitalized based on actual capital expenditures from the period when development or redevelopment commences until the asset is ready for its intended use, at the weighted average borrowing rate of our unsecured indebtedness during the period.\n\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nUse of Derivative Financial Instruments\nSame store total operating revenue consists primarily of rental income consisting of (i) fixed lease payments, variable lease payments, straight-line rental income, and above and below market lease amortization from our properties ( lease income\u201d), and (ii) other tenant billings for insurance, real estate taxes and certain other expenses ( other billings\u201d).\nThe following table summarizes a reconciliation of our NOI for the periods presented to net income, the nearest GAAP equivalent.\nAll current leases are classified as operating leases and rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease (and expected bargain renewal terms or assumed exercise of early termination options) when collectability is reasonably assured. Differences between rental income earned and amounts due under the lease are charged or credited, as applicable, to accrued rental income.\nFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, and we believe that to understand our performance further, FFO should be compared with our reported net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\u2022a maximum secured leverage ratio of not greater than 0.40:1.00;\n(2)The unsecured term loans have a stated interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 1.0%, with the exception of the Unsecured Term Loan G which has a spread of 1.5% and is subject to a minimum rate for LIBOR of 0.25%. As of December 31, 2020, one-month LIBOR for the Unsecured Term Loans A, D, E, F, and G was swapped to a fixed rate of 2.38%, 1.85%, 2.92%, 2.11%, and 1.17%, respectively. One-month LIBOR for the Unsecured Term Loan G will be swapped to a fixed rate of 0.28% effective March 19, 2021.\nIncentive and Equity-Based Employee Compensation Plans\n\u2022a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio of not greater than 0.60:1.00;\n(1)We define Net Debt as our amounts outstanding under our unsecured credit facility, unsecured term loans, unsecured notes, and mortgage notes, less cash and cash equivalents. We define Real Estate Cost Basis as the book value of rental property and deferred leasing intangibles, exclusive of the related accumulated depreciation and amortization.\nNet Operating Income\nThe excess of the cost of an acquired business over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Our goodwill of approximately $4.9 million represents amounts allocated to the assembled workforce from the acquired management company, and is presented in prepaid expenses and other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our goodwill has an indeterminate life and is not amortized, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis at December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We take a qualitative approach to consider whether an impairment of goodwill exists prior to quantitatively determining the fair value of the reporting unit in step one of the impairment test. We have recorded no impairments to goodwill as of December 31, 2020.\nFor properties classified as held for sale, we cease depreciating and amortizing the rental property and value the rental property at the lower of depreciated and amortized cost or fair value less costs to dispose. We present those properties classified as held for sale with any qualifying assets and liabilities associated with those properties as held for sale in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe record all derivatives on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.\nWe evaluate cash basis versus accrual basis of rental income recognition based on the collectability of future lease payments.\n\u2022the overall quality of the transportation infrastructure in the United States.\nIn determining the fair value of the debt assumed, we discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on mortgage debt based on a current market rate. The associated fair market value debt adjustment is amortized through interest expense over the life of the debt on a basis which approximates the effective interest method.\nTotal other income (expense) consists of interest and other income, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on involuntary conversion, and gain on the sales of rental property, net. Interest expense includes interest incurred during the period as well as adjustments related to amortization of financing fees and debt issuance costs, and amortization of fair market value adjustments associated with the assumption of debt.\nTotal same store expenses increased by $1.8 million or 3.4% to $55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $53.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily related to increases in real estate taxes levied by the related taxing authority and changes to lease terms where we began paying the real estate taxes on behalf of tenants that had previously paid its taxes directly to the taxing authority of approximately $3.1 million, as well as an increase in snow removal and other expenses of approximately $0.6 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in insurance expenses of approximately $1.4 million and a decrease in repairs and maintenance and utility expenses of $0.5 million.\nThe following table summarizes certain information with respect to the indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nTotal other income (expense) consists of interest and other income, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, and gain on the sales of rental property, net. Interest expense includes interest incurred during the period as well as adjustments related to amortization of financing fees and debt issuance costs, and amortization of fair market value adjustments associated with the assumption of debt.\n(6)The weighted average interest rate was calculated using the fixed interest rate swapped on the current notional amount of $975.0 million of debt, and was not adjusted to include the amortization of deferred financing fees or debt issuance costs incurred in obtaining debt or any unamortized fair market value premiums.\nIn the first half of 2020, the U.S. federal and state governments, as well as the Federal Reserve, responded to the profoundly uncertain outlook with a series of policies to ease the economic burden of COVID-19 closures on businesses and individuals. The major U.S. congressional policy action known as the Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, allocated $2 trillion in federal aid to specific industries, small businesses and individuals. The Federal Reserve also took major actions including the completion of two emergency fed funds rate cuts in March 2020 to a range between 0% to 0.25%, which resulted in added liquidity to the bond market, establishing new lending facilities, and expanding its bond buying program to include mortgage backed securities, investment grade corporate debt, and high yield corporate exchange-traded funds. In the fourth quarter, due to surging COVID-19 cases in the United States, certain economic lockdown measures returned, and pressure on certain businesses renewed. In addition, in November 2020, the U.S. elections resulted in the Democratic party taking control of the Presidency and Congress. The new Biden administration entered office in January 2021 on the heels of the first phase of U.S. vaccine distribution and of a newly passed, $900 billion COVID-19 relief bill to further support businesses and individuals. We expect supportive fiscal and monetary policy to continue under the Biden administration as needed.\nThe unsecured credit facility provides for a facility fee payable by us to the lenders at a rate per annum of 0.125% to 0.3%, depending on our debt rating, as defined in the credit agreement, of the aggregate commitments (currently $500.0 million). The facility fee is due and payable quarterly.\nAt December 31, 2019 we owned eight flex/office buildings consisting of approximately 0.4 million square feet, six buildings in our Value Add Portfolio consisting of approximately 1.4 million square feet, two buildings classified as held for sale consisting of approximately 0.7 million square feet, and six buildings consisting of approximately 1.6 million square feet that were Operating Portfolio buildings with expansions placed in service or transferred from the Value Add Portfolio to the Operating Portfolio after December 31, 2017. These buildings contributed approximately $9.7 million and $10.0 million to NOI for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Additionally, there was $0.1 million and $(0.2) million of termination, solar, and other income adjustments from certain buildings in our same store portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nSame store rental income, which is comprised of lease income and other billings as discussed below, increased by $6.3 million or 2.2% to $299.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $293.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our same store total operating revenue to net income, see the table above.\nThe above and below market lease values are amortized into rental income over the remaining lease term. The value of in-place lease intangibles and tenant relationships are amortized over the remaining lease term (and expected renewal period of the respective lease for tenant relationships) as increases to depreciation and amortization expense. The remaining lease terms are adjusted for bargain renewal options or assumed exercises of early termination options, as applicable. If a tenant subsequently terminates its lease, any unamortized portion of above and below market leases is accelerated into rental income and the in-place lease value and tenant relationships are accelerated into depreciation and amortization expense over the shortened lease term.\nThe aggregate undrawn nominal commitments on the unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loans as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $390.0 million, including issued letters of credit. Our actual borrowing capacity at any given point in time may be less and is restricted to a maximum amount based on our debt covenant compliance.\nWhile we did not incur significant disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2020, a number of our tenants requested rent deferral or rent abatement as a result of the pandemic. In response to such requests, we entered into rent deferral agreement with certain tenants during the year ended December 31, 2020, which resulted in approximately $2.1 million of rent deferrals during the year ended December 31, 2020. We will continue to evaluate tenant rent relief requests on an individual basis, considering a number of factors. Not all tenant requests will ultimately result in modified agreements, nor are we foregoing our contractual rights under our lease agreements.\n\n\n\u2022a minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio of not less than or equal to 1.75:1.00.\nWe recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of equity. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value and the changes in fair value must be reflected as income or expense.\nTotal net other income increased $122.3 million or 259.3% to $75.2 million total other income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $47.2 million total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is primarily the result of an increase in the gain on the sales of rental property, net of $128.3 million, as well as an increase in gain on involuntary conversion of $2.2 million. Additionally, there was an increase of approximately $0.4 million in interest and other income due to an increased cash and cash equivalents balance during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. These increases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense of approximately $7.7 million which was primarily attributable to the funding of unsecured term loans on March 25, 2020, December 18, 2019, and July 25, 2019. Additionally, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 that was primarily related to the refinance of the Unsecured Term Loan B and the Unsecured Term Loan C on April 17, 2020, as discussed in Note 4 of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFinancial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, tenant accounts receivable, interest rate swaps, accounts payable, accrued expenses, unsecured credit facility, unsecured term loans, unsecured notes, and mortgage notes. See Note 4 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the fair value of our indebtedness. See Note 5 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the fair value of our interest rate swaps.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had letters of credit related to development projects and certain other agreements of approximately $3.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had no other material off-balance sheet arrangements. See the table under Liquidity and Capital Resources-Contractual Obligations\u201d above for information regarding certain off-balance sheet arrangements.\nNet Income\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nOn January 11, 2021, our board of directors declared the common stock dividends for the months ending January 31, 2021, February 28, 2021 and March 31, 2021 at a monthly rate of $0.120833 per share of common stock.\nIndebtedness Outstanding\nCovenants: Our ability to borrow, maintain borrowings and avoid default under the unsecured credit facility, the unsecured term loans, and unsecured notes is subject to our ongoing compliance with a number of financial covenants, including:\nThe following table summarizes our Operating Portfolio leases that commenced during the year ended December 31, 2020. Certain leases contain rental concessions; any such rental concessions are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our same store total operating revenue to net income, see the table above.\nSame Store Total Operating Revenue\nOther Net Operating Income\nOn November 16, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of an aggregate of 8,000,000 shares of common stock offered by the forward dealer in connection with certain forward sale agreements at a price to the underwriters of $30.02 per share. On December 15, 2020, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 1,200,000 shares for an offering price of $29.90 per share. The offering closed on November 19, 2020 and the underwriters' option closed on December 17, 2020. On December 23, 2020, we partially settled the forward sales agreements by issuing 4,518,077 shares of common stock and received net proceeds of approximately $135.0 million. Subject to our right to elect cash or net share settlement, we have the ability to settle the remaining forward sales agreements at any time through scheduled maturity date of the forward sale agreements of November 16, 2021.\nPursuant to the terms of our unsecured debt agreements, we may not pay distributions that exceed the minimum amount required for us to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT if a default or event of default occurs and is continuing.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $60.6 million to $293.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $233.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to incremental operating cash flows from property acquisitions completed after December 31, 2019, and operating performance at existing properties. These increases were partially offset by the loss of cash flows from property dispositions completed after December 31, 2019 and fluctuations in working capital due to timing of payments and rental receipts.\nThe Series C Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to dividend rights and rights upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs. The Series C Preferred Stock has no stated maturity date and is not subject to mandatory redemption or any sinking fund. Generally, we are not permitted to redeem the Series C Preferred Stock prior to March 17, 2021, except in limited circumstances relating to our ability to qualify as a REIT and in certain other circumstances related to a change of control.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, specifically our obligations under long-term debt agreements and ground lease agreements.\nFunds From Operations\nFor a detailed reconciliation of our same store portfolio operating expenses to net income, see the table above.\nDepreciation expense is computed
