established certain accounting and financial reporting policies to govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) in the preparation of its financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities; management considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from the judgments and estimates adopted by management which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations. We believe the following accounting policies applied by Ameris represent critical accounting policies.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe believe the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable incurred losses in the Company's loan portfolio. Calculation of the allowance for loan losses represents a critical accounting estimate due to the significant judgment, assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses, consideration of subjective environmental factors and the amount and timing of cash flows related to impaired loans.\nManagement believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review the Company's\nallowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.\nConsidering current information and events regarding a borrower's ability to repay its obligations, management considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectability of all amounts due, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, is in doubt. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or if the loan is collateral-dependent, the fair value of the collateral is used to determine the amount of impairment. Impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for loan losses.\nSubsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses. Cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Cash receipts on impaired loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied first to principal and then to interest income.\nCertain economic and interest rate factors could have a material impact on the determination of the allowance for loan losses. An improving economy could result in the expansion of businesses and creation of jobs which would positively affect our loan growth and improve our gross revenue stream. Conversely, certain factors could result from an expanding economy which could increase our credit costs and adversely impact our net earnings. A significant rapid rise in interest rates could create higher borrowing costs and shrinking corporate profits which could have a material impact on a borrower's ability to pay. We will continue to concentrate on maintaining a high quality loan portfolio through strict administration of our loan policy.\nAnother factor that we have considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses is loan concentrations to individual borrowers or industries. Based on total committed exposure at December 31, 2019, we had nine individual loans/lines of credit that exceeded our normal in-house credit limit of $40.0 million. Total exposure from these nine individual loans/lines of credit amounted to $600.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The largest total committed exposure for a single loan/line of credit at December 31, 2019 was $100.0 million, and we had one line of credit at this level extended to a client of our warehouse lending division. As of December 31, 2019, we had 14 relationships consisting of 52 loans/lines of credit that exceeded $40.0 million. Total exposure from these 14 relationships amounted to $874.0 million as of December 31, 2019. The largest total committed exposure for a single relationship at December 31, 2019 was $100.0 million, and we had one relationship at this level which is a client of our warehouse lending division as well. Additional disclosure concerning the Company's largest loan relationships is provided in the Balance Sheet Comparison\u201d section below.\nA substantial portion of our loan portfolio is in the commercial real estate and residential real estate sectors. The majority of these loans are secured by real estate in our primary market areas. A substantial portion of OREO is located in those same markets. Therefore, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of our loan portfolio and the recoverability of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of OREO are susceptible to changes to market conditions in our primary market area.\nBusiness Combinations\nAssets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of purchased assets or assumed liabilities. On the date of acquisition, when the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. The Company must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield which will have a positive impact on future interest income.\nIncome Taxes\nAs required by GAAP, we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. See Note 14, Income Taxes,\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as the provision for loan losses and gains on FDIC-\nassisted transactions, for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or adjust this allowance in a period, we must include an expense within the tax provisions in the statement of income.\nLong-Lived Assets, Including Intangibles\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets purchased in business combinations. Goodwill is required to be tested annually for impairment or whenever events occur that may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount is not probable. In the event of an impairment, the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value is charged to earnings. The Company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year.\nIntangible assets include core deposit premiums from various past bank acquisitions as well as intangible assets recorded in connection with the USPF acquisition for insurance agent relationships, the \"US Premium Finance\" trade name and a non-compete agreement.\nCore deposit premiums acquired in various past bank acquisitions are based on the established value of acquired customer deposits. The core deposit premium is initially recognized based on a valuation performed as of the acquisition date and is amortized over an estimated useful life of seven to ten years.\nThe insurance agent relationships, the \"US Premium Finance\" trade name and non-compete agreement intangible assets acquired in the USPF acquisition are based on the established values as of the acquisition date and are being amortized over estimated useful lives of eight years, seven years and three years, respectively.\nThe valuation of intangible assets involves significant forward looking assumptions such as economic conditions, market interest rates, asset growth rates, credit losses, etc. Changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the valuation of the intangible assets.\nAmortization periods for intangible assets are reviewed annually in connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill.\nServicing Assets\nWe sell residential mortgage and SBA loans with servicing retained. We have also assumed servicing of loans sold with servicing retained, primarily indirect automobile loan pools, in prior acquisitions. When the contractual servicing fees on loans sold with servicing retained are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer for performing the servicing, a capitalized servicing asset is recognized. Servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized into non-interest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. Management makes certain estimates and assumptions related to costs to service varying types of loans and pools of loans, the projected lives of loans and pools of loans sold, and discount factors used in calculating the present values of servicing fees projected to be received.\nNo less frequently than quarterly for mortgage servicing rights and semi-annually for all other servicing rights, management reviews the status of all loans and pools of loans sold with related capitalized servicing assets to determine if there is any impairment to those assets due to such factors as earlier than estimated repayments or significant prepayments. Any impairment identified in these assets will result in reductions in their carrying values through a valuation allowance and a corresponding increase in operating expenses.\nNET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe Company's net income during 2019 was $161.4 million, or $2.75 per diluted share, compared with $121.0 million, or $2.80 per diluted share, in 2018, and $73.5 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, in 2017.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recorded net income of $61.2 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared with $43.5 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, and $9.2 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nEARNING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nAverage earning assets were approximately $13.13 billion in 2019, compared with approximately $8.86 billion in 2018. The earning asset and interest-bearing liability mix is regularly monitored to maximize the net interest margin and, therefore, increase return on assets and shareholders' equity.\nThe following statistical information should be read in conjunction with the remainder of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report and in the documents incorporated herein by reference.\nThe following tables set forth the amount of average balance, interest income or interest expense, and average interest rate for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin on average interest-earning assets. Federally tax-exempt income is presented on a taxable-equivalent basis assuming a 21% federal tax rate for 2019 and 2018 and a 35% federal tax rate for 2017.\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>

incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the largest component of our income and is affected by the interest rate environment and the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities, other investments, interest-bearing deposits in banks, federal funds sold and time deposits in other banks. Our interest-bearing liabilities include deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, other borrowings and subordinated deferrable interest debentures.\n2019 compared with 2018.

</tr>\n</table>\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses is based on management's evaluation of the size and composition of the loan portfolio, the level of non-performing and past due loans, historical trends of charged-off loans and recoveries, prevailing economic conditions and other factors management deems appropriate. As these factors change, the level of loan loss provision may change.\nThe Company's provision for loan losses during 2019 amounted to $19.8 million, compared with $16.7 million for 2018 and $8.4 million for 2017. Net charge-offs in 2019 were 0.10% of average loans compared with 0.18% in 2018 and 0.12% in 2017. Net charge-offs in 2019 were 0.15% of average legacy loans, compared with 0.27% in 2018 and 0.13% in 2017. Of the $14.5 million in legacy loan net charge-offs recorded during 2018, approximately $7.2 million, or 49.5%, were charge-offs within the Premium Finance Division stemming from two purchased loan relationships. These two relationships were non-core general operating lines to insurance agencies and were not the traditional premium finance offerings that the Company primarily focuses on. Management notes that both agencies suffered unusual circumstances that precipitated their defaults. Excluding these unusual charge-offs, total net charge-offs for 2018 would have been 0.09% of average total loans and legacy net charge-offs in 2018 would have been 0.14% of average legacy loans. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining balance on those non-core loans totaled $6.8 million.\nAt December 31, 2019, non-performing assets amounted to $101.3 million, or 0.56% of total assets, compared with $63.0 million, or 0.55% of total assets, at December 31, 2018. Legacy non-performing assets totaled $39.5 million and $29.4 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Legacy other real estate was approximately $4.5 million as of December 31, 2019, reflecting a 37.7% decrease from the $7.2 million reported at December 31, 2018. Purchased other real estate was $15.0 million at December 31, 2019, reflecting a 57.3% increase from the $9.5 million at December 31, 2018.\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was $38.2 million, or 0.30% of loans compared with $28.8 million, or 0.34%, and $25.8 million, or 0.43%, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding purchased loans and purchased loan pools, the Company's allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was $34.3 million, or 0.46% of loans, compared with $26.2 million, or 0.46%, and $21.5 million, or 0.44%, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company experienced growth in all non-purchased loan segments in 2019 except consumer installment loans which decreased slightly. The allowance as a percentage of loans, excluding purchased loans and purchased loan pools, at December 31, 2019 remained stable compared with December 31, 2018, as increases in the loss rate on commercial, financial and agricultural loans and qualitative factors on residential real estate loans offset improvements in either qualitative factors or loss rates on other portfolios. A significant portion of the Company's loan growth during 2019 consisted of commercial real estate, residential mortgage loans and funded balances on residential mortgage warehouse lines of credit, each of which the Company has experienced low rates of loss.\nNoninterest Income\nFollowing is a comparison of noninterest income for 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges on deposit accounts </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,054 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking activities </td> <td> </td> <td>119,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,535 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other service charges, commissions and fees </td> <td> </td> <td>3,913 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,883 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain (loss) on securities </td> <td> </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of SBA loans </td> <td> </td> <td>6,058 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,590 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other noninterest income </td> <td> </td> <td>17,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,358 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>198,113 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,457 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2019 compared with 2018. Total noninterest income in 2019 was $198.1 million, compared with $118.4 million in 2018, reflecting an increase of 67.3%, or $79.7 million.\nService charges on deposit accounts increased by $4.7 million, or 10.1%, to $50.8 million during 2019 compared with 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to the Fidelity acquisition which closed on July 1, 2019 and the full year impact of the Atlantic and Hamilton acquisitions which both closed during the second quarter of 2018. Maintenance service charges on deposits and non-sufficient funds/overdraft charges both increased during 2019 while interchange income decreased slightly due to the impact of the Durbin Amendment beginning in the third quarter of 2019.\nOther service charges, commission and fees increased by $854,000 to $3.9 million during 2019, an increase of 27.9% compared with 2018 due primarily to an increase in ATM fees.\nIncome from mortgage banking activities increased $65.8 million, or 122.6%, to $119.4 million during 2019 compared with 2018. This increase was a result of both the Fidelity acquisition and additional growth from the low interest rate environment during the second half of 2019. Total production in the retail mortgage division increased to $4.3 billion for 2019, compared with $1.8 billion for 2018, while gain on sale spreads decreased in 2019 to 2.75% from 2.92% in 2018. The decrease in gain on sale spread is primarily related to a shift in product mix and transition of the Fidelity pricing model through conversion. Noninterest income from the Company's warehouse lending division was approximately flat at $2.0 million for 2019 compared with 2018.\nGain on sale of SBA loans increased by $3.3 million, or 122.1%, to $6.1 million during 2019 compared with 2018, reflecting an 118.1% increase in SBA loans sold during 2019 compared with 2018.\nOther noninterest income increased by $4.9 million, or 38.2%, to $17.8 million during 2019 compared with 2018. This increase was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in loan servicing income and a $3.6 million gain on BOLI proceeds due to the unfortunate death of a former officer of Fidelity. Additionally, check order fees, merchant fee income, trust services activities income and income from bank owned life insurance were higher in 2019. These increases were partially offset by $4.5 million in other income recorded during 2018 to reflect a decrease in the USPF acquisition contingent consideration expected to be paid.\n2018 compared with 2017. Total noninterest income in 2018 was $118.4 million, compared with $104.5 million in 2017, reflecting an increase of 13.4%, or $14.0 million.\nService charges on deposit accounts increased by $4.1 million, or 9.7%, to $46.1 million during 2018 compared with 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to the Atlantic and Hamilton acquisitions which both closed during the second quarter of 2018. All areas of service charges on deposits increased during 2018 including maintenance service charges on deposits, interchange income, and non-sufficient funds/overdraft charges.\nOther service charges, commission and fees increased by $176,000 to $3.1 million during 2018, an increase of 6.1% compared with 2017 due to an increase in ATM fees.\nIncome from mortgage banking activities increased $5.1 million, or 10.5%, to $53.7 million during 2018 compared with 2017. Retail mortgage revenues increased $11.2 million, or 18.5%, during 2018, from $60.5 million for 2017 to $71.7 million for 2018. Net income for the Company's retail mortgage division grew 35.9% during 2018 to $16.5 million. Revenues from the Company's warehouse lending division increased $3.5 million, or 45.9%, during the year, from $7.6 million for 2017 to $11.1 million for 2018. Net income for the warehouse lending division increased $3.7 million, or 86.8%, during 2018, from $4.3 million for 2017 to $8.1 million for 2018.\nGain on sale of SBA loans decreased by $1.9 million, or 40.6%, to $2.7 million during 2018 compared with 2017, reflecting a 33.2% reduction in SBA loans sold during 2018 compared with 2017.\nOther noninterest income increased by $6.5 million, or 102.6%, to $12.8 million during 2018 compared with 2017. This increase was primarily due to $4.5 million in other income recorded to reflect a decrease in the USPF acquisition contingent consideration expected to be paid. Additionally, loan servicing fee income, check order fees, merchant fee income, and income from bank owned life insurance were higher in 2018.\nNoninterest Expense\nFollowing is a comparison of noninterest expense for 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>223,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>149,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>119,783 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy and equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>40,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,069 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising and marketing </td> <td> </td> <td>7,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,571 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,131 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets </td> <td> </td> <td>17,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,932 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data processing and communications expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>38,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,869 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal and other professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td>10,634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,355 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit resolution-related expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>4,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,493 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger and conversion charges </td> <td> </td> <td>73,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>915 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FDIC insurance </td> <td> </td> <td>1,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,078 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other noninterest expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>53,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>471,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>293,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>231,936 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2019 compared with 2018. Total noninterest expense increased $178.3 million, or 60.7%, in 2019 to $471.9 million from $293.6 million in 2018. Total noninterest expense for 2019 include approximately $73.1 million in merger-related charges, $6.0 million in losses on sale of bank premises, $245,000 in restructuring charges, ($39,000) in financial impact of hurricanes charges, and $463,000 in expenses related to the previously announced SEC and DOJ investigation. Total noninterest expense for 2018 includes approximately $20.5 million in merger-related charges, $8.4 million in executive retirement benefits, $983,000 in restructuring charges, $882,000 in financial impact of hurricanes and $1.0 million in losses on sale of bank premises. Excluding these amounts, expenses in 2019 increased by $130.3 million, or 49.8%, compared with 2018 levels.\nSalaries and benefits increased $74.8 million, or 50.2%, from $149.1 million in 2018 to $223.9 million in 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to staff additions resulting from the Fidelity acquisition which closed at the beginning of the third quarter of 2019 and an increase in variable pay resulting from increased production levels in our retail mortgage division. Full time equivalent employees increased from 1,804 at December 31, 2018 to 2,722 at December 31, 2019.\nOccupancy costs increased $11.5 million, or 39.4%, from $29.1 million in 2018 to $40.6 million in 2019 due primarily to 62 branch locations being added during 2019 as a result of the Fidelity acquisition, partially offset by branch closures related to previously announced branch consolidations.\nAmortization of intangible assets increased $8.2 million, or 86.2%, to $17.7 million for 2019 compared with $9.5 million for 2018 due to additional amortization of intangible assets recorded as part of the USPF, Atlantic, Hamilton and Fidelity acquisitions.\nData processing and telecommunications expenses increased $8.1 million, or 26.8%, to $38.5 million for 2019 compared with $30.4 million for 2018. This increase reflects increased core banking system charges due to an increase in the number of accounts being processed by our core banking system as a result of the Atlantic, Hamilton and Fidelity acquisitions and a $1.4 million refund recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to overcharges on prior billings from a data processing vendor.\nOther professional fees increased $4.2 million, or 66.5%, from $6.4 million in 2018 to $10.6 million in 2019, primarily due to consulting fees related to implementation of a new support system and an increase in mortgage consulting related to increases in production volume.\nMerger and conversion charges were $73.1 million in 2019, an increase of $52.6 million, or 256.6%, compared with $20.5 million recorded for 2018. Merger and conversion charges in 2019 primarily related to the acquisition of Fidelity while those in 2018 were primarily related to the acquisitions of USPF, Atlantic and Hamilton during 2018, as well as the conversion of both Atlantic and Hamilton to our core system during 2018.\nOther noninterest expense increased $17.9 million, or 50.2%, to $53.5 million in 2019 from $35.6 million in 2018, resulting primarily from increases in loss on sale of bank premises, ATM expenses, loan servicing expense, and deposit account charge-offs, partially offset by a decrease in hurricane related expenses and debit card charge-offs. Also contributing to the increase was an increase in variable expenses related to our elevated mortgage production.\n2018 compared with 2017. Total noninterest expense increased $61.7 million, or 26.6%, in 2018 to $293.6 million from $231.9 million in 2017. Total noninterest expense for 2018 include approximately $20.5 million in merger-related charges, $8.4 million in executive retirement benefits expense, $983,000 in restructuring charges, $882,000 in Hurricane Michael charges, $1.0 million in losses on sale of bank premises. Total noninterest expense for 2017 includes approximately $915,000 in merger-related charges, $5.2 million in compliance-related charges, $410,000 in Hurricane Irma charges and $1.3 million in losses on sale of bank premises. Excluding these amounts, expenses in 2018 increased by $37.6 million, or 16.8%, compared with 2017 levels.\nSalaries and benefits increased $29.3 million, or 24.5%, from $119.8 million in 2017 to $149.1 million in 2018. This increase was attributable to $8.4 million in expense related to executive retirement benefits coupled with higher incentive pay, increased share-based compensation expense and increased investment in the Company's BSA function, as well as staff additions resulting from the Atlantic acquisition and the Hamilton acquisition both of which closed during the second quarter of 2018. Full time equivalent employees increased from 1,460 at December 31, 2017 to 1,804 at December 31, 2018.\nOccupancy costs increased $5.1 million, or 21.03%, from $24.1 million in 2017 to $29.1 million in 2018 due primarily to 28 branch locations being added during 2018 as a result of the Atlantic and Hamilton acquisitions.\nAmortization of intangible assets increased $5.6 million, or 141.9%, to $9.5 million for 2018 compared with $3.9 million for 2017 due to additional amortization of intangible assets recorded as part of the USPF, Atlantic and Hamilton acquisitions.\nData processing and telecommunications expenses increased $2.5 million, or 9.0%, to $30.4 million for 2018 compared with $27.9 million for 2018. This increase reflects increased core banking system charges due to an increase in the number of accounts being processed by our core banking system as a result of the Atlantic and Hamilton acquisitions and additional software fees related to the buildout of our BSA compliance program, partially offset by a $1.4 million refund recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to overcharges on prior billings from a data processing vendor.\nOther professional fees decreased $9.5 million, or 67.4%, from $14.1 million in 2017 to $4.6 million in 2018, primarily due to a $5.5 million reduction in fees incurred in the premium finance division pursuant to the USPF management and license agreement which were discontinued after completion of the USPF acquisition on January 31, 2018 coupled with a $5.2 million reduction in consulting fees related to our BSA compliance function.\nMerger and conversion charges of $20.5 million in 2018 reflect an increase of $19.6 million, compared with $915,000 recorded in 2017. Merger and conversion charges were elevated in 2018 due to the acquisitions of USPF, Atlantic and Hamilton during 2018, as well as the conversion of both Atlantic and Hamilton to our core system during 2018.\nOther noninterest expense increased $7.3 million, or 25.8%, to $35.6 million in 2018 from $28.3 million in 2017, resulting primarily from increases in loan servicing expense, debit card charge-offs, natural disaster expenses related to Hurricane Michael, and servicing asset amortization expense, partially offset by a decrease in loan expense.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense is influenced by statutory federal and state tax rates, the amount of taxable income, the amount of tax-exempt income and the amount of non-deductible expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded income tax expense of approximately $50.1 million, compared with $30.5 million recorded in 2018 and $50.7 million recorded in 2017. The Company's effective tax rate was 23.7%, 20.1% and 40.8% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a charge of approximately $13.6 million to income tax expense attributable to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities due to federal tax legislation that reduced the Company's future federal corporate tax rate. Excluding this remeasurement charge, income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have been $37.1 million and the Company's effective tax rate would have been approximately 29.9%.\nBALANCE SHEET COMPARISON\nLOANS\nManagement believes that our loan portfolio is adequately diversified. The loan portfolio contains no foreign loans or significant concentrations in any one industry. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 72.1% of our legacy loan portfolio was secured by real estate, compared with 68.7% at December 31, 2018 and 65.2% at December 31, 2017.\nThe amount of loans outstanding, excluding purchased loans, at the indicated dates is shown in the following table according to type of loans.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial, financial and agricultural </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,646,438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,316,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,362,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>967,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>449,623 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - construction and development </td> <td> </td> <td>1,083,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>671,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>624,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>363,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>244,693 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - commercial and farmland </td> <td> </td> <td>2,447,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,814,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,535,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,406,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,104,991 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - residential </td> <td> </td> <td>1,901,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,403,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,009,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>781,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>570,430 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer installment </td> <td> </td> <td>450,799 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>455,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>324,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109,401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,140 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans, net of unearned income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,529,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,660,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,856,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,626,821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,406,877 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the various loan types comprising the \"Commercial, financial and agricultural\" loan category displayed in the preceding table.\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>486,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>510,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>522,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>385,697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>239,151 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium finance loans </td> <td> </td> <td>654,669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>410,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>482,536 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>353,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other commercial, financial and agricultural loans </td> <td> </td> <td>505,591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>395,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>357,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>227,583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>210,472 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,646,438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,316,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,362,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>967,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>449,623 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company seeks to diversify its loan portfolio across its geographic footprint and in various loan types. Also, the Company's in-house lending limit for a single loan is $40.0 million, which would normally prevent a concentration with a single loan project. Certain lending relationships may contain more than one loan and, consequently, exceed the in-house lending limit.

Purchased loans totaled $5.08 billion and $2.59 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Purchased OREO is defined as OREO that was acquired in bank acquisitions including those acquisitions covered by the loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC. Purchased OREO totaled $15.0 million and $9.5 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Bank initially records purchased loans at fair value, taking into consideration certain credit quality risk and interest rate risk. The Company believes its estimation of credit risk and its adjustments to the carrying balances of the acquired loans is adequate. If the Company determines that a loan or group of loans has deteriorated from its initial assessment of fair value, additional provision for loan loss expense will be recorded for the impairment in value. If the Company determines that a loan or group of loans has improved from its initial assessment of fair value, then the increase in cash flows over those expected at the acquisition date will result in a reversal of provision for loan loss expense to the extent of prior provisions or will be recognized as interest income prospectively if no provisions have been made or have been fully reversed.\nThe amount of purchased loans outstanding, at the indicated dates, is shown in the following table according to type of loan.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial, financial and agricultural </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>384,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>372,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,008 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate -

As of December 31, 2019, purchased loan pools totaled $213.2 million and consisted of whole-loan, adjustable rate residential mortgages on properties outside the Company's markets, with principal balances totaling $212.4 million and $811,000 of remaining purchase premium paid at acquisition. As of December 31, 2018, purchased loan pools totaled $262.6 million with principal balances totaling $260.5 million and $2.1 million of remaining purchase premium paid at acquisition. As of December 31, 2017, purchased loan pools totaled $328.2 million with principal balances totaling $324.4 million and $3.8 million of remaining purchase premium paid at acquisition. As of December 31, 2016, purchased loan pools totaled $568.3 million with principal balances totaling $559.4 million and $8.9 million of remaining purchase premium paid at acquisition. As of December 31, 2015, purchased loan pools totaled $593.0 million with principal balances totaling $580.7 million and $12.3 million of remaining purchase premium paid at acquisition. At December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015 the Company has allocated approximately $624,000, $732,000, $1.1 million, $1.8 million and $581,000, respectively, of the allowance for loan losses to the purchased loan pools.\nAssets Covered by Loss-Sharing Agreements with the FDIC\nIncluded in purchased loans above are loans that were acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions that are covered by the loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC ( covered loans\u201d) totaling $30.3 million and $38.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. OREO that is covered by the loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC totaled $36,000 and $424,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The loss-sharing agreements are subject to the servicing procedures as specified in the agreements with the FDIC. The expected reimbursements under the loss-sharing agreements were recorded as an indemnification asset at their estimated fair value at the respective acquisition dates. The net FDIC loss-share payable reported at December 31, 2019 was $19.6 million which includes the clawback liability of $20.4 million the Bank expects to pay to the FDIC. The net FDIC loss-share payable reported at December 31, 2018 was $19.5 million which includes the clawback liability of $19.5 million the Bank expects to pay to the FDIC.\nCovered loans are shown below according to loan type as of the end of the years shown (in thousands).\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial, financial and agricultural </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,546 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - construction and development </td> <td> </td> <td>140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,612 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - commercial and farmland </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,226 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - residential </td> <td> </td> <td>29,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,038 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer installment </td> <td> </td> <td>204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total covered loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137,529 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES\nThe allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans, with a particular emphasis on non-accruing, past due and other loans that management believes might be potentially impaired or warrant additional attention. We segregate our loan portfolio by type of loan and utilize this segregation in evaluating exposure to risks within the portfolio. In addition, based on internal reviews and external reviews performed by independent loan reviewers and regulatory authorities, we further segregate our loan portfolio by loan grades based on an assessment of risk for a particular loan or group of loans. Certain reviewed loans are assigned specific allowances when a review of relevant data determines that a general allocation is not sufficient or when the review affords management the opportunity to fine tune the amount of exposure in a given credit. In\nestablishing allowances, management considers historical loan loss experience but adjusts this data with a significant emphasis on data such as current loan quality trends, current economic conditions and other factors in the markets where the Bank operates. Factors considered include, among others, current valuations of real estate in our markets, unemployment rates, the effect of weather conditions on agricultural related entities and other significant local economic events, such as major plant closings.\nWe have developed a methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses which is monitored by the Company's Chief Credit Officer. Procedures provide for the assignment of a risk rating for every loan included in the total loan portfolio. Commercial insurance premium loans, overdraft protection loans and certain mortgage loans and consumer loans serviced by outside processors are treated as pools for risk rating purposes. The risk rating schedule provides nine ratings of which five ratings are classified as pass ratings and four ratings are classified as criticized ratings. Each risk rating is assigned a percent factor to be applied to the loan balance to determine the adequate amount of allowance. Relationships in excess of $2.0 million require an annual review and are generally performed by someone independent of the loan officer. Those reviews are approved by Regional Credit Officers and are often reviewed by independent third parties, such as auditors, regulators or loan review. As a result of these loan reviews, certain loans may be assigned specific allowance allocations. Other loans that surface as problem loans may also be assigned specific allowance allocations. Assigned risk ratings can be adjusted based on the number of days past due. The calculation of the allowance for loan losses, including underlying data and assumptions, is reviewed regularly by the independent internal loan review department.\nGenerally, the primary contributor to the allowance for loan losses methodology is historical losses by loan type. The Company's look-back period for historical losses is 16 quarters. Current period losses are lower than those incurred four years ago, which has reduced the need in the allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of loans, at December 31, 2019, as compared with prior periods. The Company's qualitative factors currently utilized in determining the allowance for loan losses are generally lower than those at December 31, 2018, with limited increases in certain segments primarily driven by portfolio growth rates. Additionally, a significant portion of the Company's loan growth during 2019 consisted of residential mortgage loans, funded balances on residential mortgage warehouse lines of credit and commercial real estate loans, each of which the Company has experienced low levels of loss. The growth in lower-risk loans during 2019, combined with the improved historical loss rates and qualitative factors on certain portfolios, are the primary reasons the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans, excluding purchased loans and purchased loan pools, remained stable at 0.46% at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019.\nThe following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated. Management believes the allowance can be allocated only on an approximate basis. The allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any other category.\nTable 29:

for loan losses allocated to legacy loans totaled $34.3 million, or 0.46% of legacy loans, compared with $26.2 million, or 0.46% of legacy loans, at December 31, 2018. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of legacy loans over the past several years reflects the change in credit risk of our portfolio, both from the mix of loan and collateral types, as well as the overall improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio. Our legacy nonaccrual loans increased from $18.0 million at December 31, 2018 to $29.3 million at December 31, 2019. Legacy nonaccrual loans as a percentage of legacy loans increased from 0.32% at December 31, 2018 to 0.39% at December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our legacy net charge off ratio as a percentage of average legacy loans decreased to 0.15%, compared with 0.27% for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded legacy net charge-offs totaling $10.3 million, compared with $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to $19.8 million, compared with $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019 our ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets had increased slightly to 0.56% from 0.55% at December 31, 2018.\nThe balance of the allowance for loan losses allocated to loans collectively evaluated for impairment increased 30.1%, or $7.2 million, during the year ended December 31, 2019, while the balance of loans collectively evaluated for impairment increased 50.6%, or $4.23 billion, during the same period, reflecting the acquisition of Fidelity and organic loan growth. For legacy loans, increases in the loss rate on commercial, financial and agricultural loans and qualitative factors on residential real estate loans offset improvements in either qualitative factors or loss rates on other portfolios. A significant portion of the legacy loan growth during 2019 was concentrated in commercial real estate, residential mortgage loans and funded balances on residential mortgage warehouse lines of credit, each of which the Company has experienced low rates of loss on. We consider a four year loss rate on all loan categories and our charge off ratio has been steadily declining over that period. We have adjusted the qualitative factors to account for the inherent risks in the portfolio that are not captured in the historical loss rates, such as commodity prices for agriculture products, growth rates of certain loan types and other factors management deems appropriate. As a percentage of all loans collectively evaluated for impairment, the allowance allocated to those loans decreased three basis points, from 0.28% at December 31, 2018 to 0.25% at December 31, 2019. The largest increase in allowance allocated to loans collectively evaluated for impairment as a percentage of the related loans was noted in legacy residential real estate and commercial, financial, and agricultural loan categories. The allowance allocated to residential real estate loans evaluated collectively for impairment increased from 0.32% at December 31, 2018 to 0.36% at December 31, 2019 reflecting the elevated growth rate for this loan category. The allowance allocated to commercial, financial and agricultural loans evaluated collectively for impairment increased from 0.28% at December 31, 2018 to 0.32% at December 31, 2019 due to an increase in historical net chargeoffs for this loan category.\nThe balance of the allowance for loan losses allocated to loans individually evaluated for impairment increased 44.3%, or $2.2 million, during the year ended December 31, 2019, while the balance of loans individually evaluated for impairment increased 53.0%, or $28.6 million during the same period. The increase in the allowance for loan losses allocated to loans individually evaluated for impairment was primarily attributable to purchased loans. The increase in the balance of loans individually evaluated for impairment was primarily attributable to purchased loans and a small number of residential real estate and commercial, financial and agricultural loans.\nNONPERFORMING LOANS\nA loan is placed on non-accrual status when, in management's judgment, the collection of the interest income appears doubtful. Interest receivable that has been accrued in prior years and is subsequently determined to have doubtful collectability is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Interest on loans that are classified as non-accrual is recognized when received. Past due loans are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. In some cases, where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties, loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the original contractual terms. The following table presents an analysis of loans accounted for on a non-accrual basis and loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments and still accruing, excluding purchased loans.\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-accrual loans, excluding purchased loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial, financial and agricultural </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,302 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate -

or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs, and the ability of our Company to meet those needs. We seek to meet liquidity requirements primarily through management of short-term investments (principally interest-bearing deposits in banks) and monthly amortizing loans. Another source of liquidity is the repayment of maturing single payment loans. In addition, our Company maintains relationships with correspondent banks, including the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which could provide funds on short notice, if needed.\nA principal objective of our asset/liability management strategy is to minimize our exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the maturity and repricing horizons of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. This strategy is overseen in part through the direction of our Asset and Liability Committee (the ALCO Committee\u201d) which establishes policies and monitors results to control interest rate sensitivity.\nAs part of our interest rate risk management policy, the ALCO Committee examines the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive\u201d and monitors its interest rate-sensitivity gap.\u201d An asset or liability is considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within the time period analyzed, usually one year or less. The interest rate-sensitivity gap is the difference between the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within such time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate-sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities exceeds the interest rate-sensitive assets. During a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income, while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income, while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income. If our assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently, the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal.\nA simple interest rate gap\u201d analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Accordingly, the ALCO Committee also evaluates how the repayment of particular assets and liabilities is impacted by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may not react identically to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps\u201d) which limit changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase.\nWe manage the mix of asset and liability maturities in an effort to control the effects of changes in the general level of interest rates on net interest income. Except for its effect on the general level of interest rates, inflation does not have a material impact on the balance sheet due to the rate variability and short-term maturities of its earning assets. In particular, approximately 39.7% of earning assets mature or reprice within one year or less. Mortgage loans, generally our loan category with the longest maturity, are usually made with fifteen to thirty year maturities, but a portion is at a variable interest rate with an adjustment between origination date and maturity date.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, which is the authority that regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR, and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. The Company has material contracts that are indexed to LIBOR, which include certain financial instruments within investment securities, loans, other borrowings, subordinated deferrable interest debentures and derivative financial instruments. Company management is monitoring this development in the financial markets and is evaluating the related risks. The Company has established a working committee with representatives from relevant functional areas to inventory the contracts and accounts that are tied to LIBOR and develop a transition plan for the affected items.\nThe following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2019, the interest rate sensitivity gap (i.e., interest rate sensitive assets minus interest rate sensitive liabilities), the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap, the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio (i.e., interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitive liabilities) and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio. The table also sets forth the time periods in which earning assets and liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms. However, the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers. In addition, various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times within such period and at different rates.\nTable 50: <table><tr><td>

computed using coupon interest, adding discount accretion or subtracting premium amortization, as appropriate, on a ratable basis over the life of each security. The weighted average yield for each maturity range was computed using the amortized cost of each security in that range.\n(2)Yields on securities of state and political subdivisions are stated on a taxable-equivalent basis, using a tax rate of 21%.\nThe investment portfolio consists of securities which are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of the related deferred tax effect.\nThe amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recognized in interest income using methods approximating the interest method over the life of the securities. Realized gains and losses, determined on the basis of the cost of specific securities sold, are included in earnings on the trade date. Declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses.\nThe Company's methodology for determining whether other-than-temporary impairment losses exist include management considering (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer or underlying collateral of the security, and (iii) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.\nManagement evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Substantially all of the unrealized losses on debt securities are related to changes in interest rates and do not affect the expected cash flows of the issuer or underlying collateral. All unrealized losses are considered temporary because each security carries an acceptable investment grade, the Company has the intent and ability to hold such securities until maturity and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery or maturity.

The amounts of time certificates of deposit issued in amounts of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2019, are shown below by category, which is based on time remaining until maturity of (i) three months or less, (ii) over three through twelve months and (iii) greater than one year.\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months or less </td> <td>$ </td> <td>479,264 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months to one year </td> <td>1,068,594 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One year or greater </td> <td>325,980 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,873,838 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nIn the ordinary course of business, our Bank has granted commitments to extend credit to approved customers. Generally, these commitments to extend credit have been granted on a temporary basis for seasonal or inventory requirements or for construction period financing and have been approved within the Bank's credit guidelines. Our Bank has also granted commitments to approved customers for financial standby letters of credit. These commitments are recorded in the financial statements when funds are disbursed or the financial instruments become payable. The Bank uses the same credit policies for these off-balance-sheet commitments as it does for financial instruments that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitment amounts expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nThe following table summarizes commitments outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments to extend credit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,486,949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,671,419 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused lines of credit </td> <td> </td> <td>262,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112,310 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial standby letters of credit </td> <td> </td> <td>29,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,596 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage interest rate lock commitments </td> <td> </td> <td>288,490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,833 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage forward contracts with positive fair value </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage forward contracts with negative fair value </td> <td> </td> <td>1,814,669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163,189 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,881,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,053,347 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes short-term borrowings for the periods indicated.\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nRate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nRate\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Average\nRate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,692 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,694 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total maximum short-term borrowings outstanding at any month-end during the year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,626 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had a cash flow hedge that matures September 15, 2020 with a notional amount of $37.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, for the purpose of converting the variable rate on the junior subordinated debentures to a fixed rate of 4.11%. The interest rate swap, which is classified as a cash flow hedge, is indexed to 90-Day LIBOR.\nAs of December 31, 2019, letters of credit issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank totaling $82.4 million were used to guarantee the Bank's performance related to a portion of its public fund deposit balances.\nThe following table sets forth certain information about contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due After December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>1 Year\nor Less\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4-5\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> <td>>5\nYears\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits without a stated maturity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,159,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,159,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time certificates of deposit </td> <td> </td> <td>2,867,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,317,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>494,421 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,057 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase agreements with customers </td> <td> </td> <td>20,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>1,400,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,125,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275,249 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated deferrable interest debentures </td> <td> </td> <td>159,545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>159,545 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>45,295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,818 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,538 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic marketing and promotional arrangements </td> <td> </td> <td>2,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,655,497 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,634,868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>513,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>444,389 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2019, estimated costs to complete construction projects in progress and other binding commitments for capital expenditures were not a material amount.\nCAPITAL ADEQUACY\nCapital Regulations\nThe capital resources of the Company are monitored on a periodic basis by state and federal regulatory authorities. During 2019, the Company's capital increased $1.01 billion, primarily due to the issuance of Common Stock of $869.3 million and net income of $161.4 million, which amounts were partially offset by the cash dividends declared on common shares of $30.4 million and treasury stock purchases of $18.4 million. During 2018, the Company's capital increased $547.1 million, primarily due to the issuance of Common Stock of $547.1 million and net income of $121.0 million, which amounts were partially offset by the cash dividends declared on common shares of $17.4 million. For both 2019 and 2018, other capital related transactions, such as other comprehensive income, share-based compensation, common stock issuances through the exercise of stock options, and issuances of shares of restricted stock accounted for only a small change in the capital of the Company.\nIn accordance with risk capital guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve, we are required to maintain a minimum standard of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%. Additionally, all member banks must maintain core\u201d or Tier 1\u201d capital of at least 4% of total assets ( leverage ratio\u201d). Member banks operating at or near the 4% capital level are expected to have well-diversified risks, including no undue interest rate risk exposure, excellent control systems, good earnings, high asset quality and well managed on- and off-balance sheet activities, and, in general, be considered strong banking organizations with a composite 1 rating under the CAMEL rating system of banks. For all but the most highly rated banks meeting the above conditions, the minimum leverage ratio is to be 4% plus an additional 1% to 2%.\nThe final rules implementing Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. banks ( Basel III rules\u201d) became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in over a multi-year schedule, and fully phased in by January 1, 2019. Under the Basel III rules, the Company must hold a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized risk-based capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in from 0.0% for 2015 to 2.50% by 2019. The capital conservation buffer was 0.625% for 2016, 1.250% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018 and 2.50% for 2019.\nThe following table summarizes the regulatory capital levels of Ameris at December 31, 2019.\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Actual </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Required </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Excess </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 Leverage Ratio (tier 1 capital to average assets)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,437,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.476 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>678,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.000 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>759,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.476 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ameris Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,649,699 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.733 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>677,973 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.000 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>971,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.733 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CET1 Ratio (common equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,437,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.925 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,014,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.000 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>423,818 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.925 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ameris Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,649,699 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.394 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,013,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.000 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>636,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.394 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 Capital Ratio (tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,437,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.925 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,231,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.500 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>206,496 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.425 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ameris Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,649,699 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.394 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,230,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.500 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>419,038 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.894 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Capital Ratio (total capital to risk weighted assets)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,874,817 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.940 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,521,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.500 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>353,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.440 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ameris Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,763,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.183 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,520,228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.500 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>243,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.683 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe required CET1 Ratio, Tier 1 Capital Ratio, and the Total Capital Ratio reflected in the table above include a capital conservation buffer of 2.50%.\nINFLATION\nThe consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation.\nQUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated quarterly financial information of the Company.

Based on total committed exposure at December 31, 2019, we had nine individual loans/lines of credit that exceeded our normal in-house credit limit of $40.0 million. Total exposure from these nine individual loans/lines of credit amounted to $600.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The largest total committed exposure for a single loan/line of credit at December 31, 2019 was $100.0 million, and we had one line of credit at this level extended to a client of our warehouse lending division. As of December 31, 2019, we had 14 relationships consisting of 52 loans/lines of credit that exceeded $40.0 million. Total exposure from these 14 relationships amounted to $874.0 million as of December 31, 2019. The largest total committed exposure for a single relationship at December 31, 2019 was $100.0 million, and we had one relationship at this level which is a client of our warehouse lending division as well.

The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable incurred losses in the Company's loan portfolio. Calculation of the allowance for loan losses represents a critical accounting estimate due to the significant judgment, assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses, consideration of subjective environmental factors and the amount and timing of cash flows related to impaired loans.\n\u2022Adjusted return on average assets1 of 1.52%, compared with 1.50% in 2018\n\n\nNet interest income represents the amount by which interest income on interest-earning assets exceeds interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the largest component of our income and is affected by the interest rate environment and the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities, other investments, interest-bearing deposits in banks, federal funds sold and time deposits in other banks.

This increase was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in loan servicing income and a $3.6 million gain on BOLI proceeds due to the unfortunate death of a former officer of Fidelity. Additionally, check order fees, merchant fee income, trust services activities income and income from bank owned life insurance were higher in 2019. These increases were partially offset by $4.5 million in other income recorded during 2018 to reflect a decrease in the USPF acquisition contingent consideration expected to be paid.\nLOANS\nTotal loans (legacy loans, purchased loans and purchased loan pools) which have maturity dates after one year are summarized below by those loans that have predetermined interest rates and those loans that have floating or adjustable interest rates.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans, with a particular emphasis on non-accruing, past due and other loans that management believes might be potentially impaired or warrant additional attention. We segregate our loan portfolio by type of loan and utilize this segregation in evaluating exposure to risks within the portfolio. In addition, based on internal reviews and external reviews performed by independent loan reviewers and regulatory authorities, we further segregate our loan portfolio by loan grades based on an assessment of risk for a particular loan or group of loans. Certain reviewed loans are assigned specific allowances when a review of relevant data determines that a general allocation is not sufficient or when the review affords management the opportunity to fine tune the amount of exposure in a given credit.

telecommunications expenses increased $2.5 million, or 9.0%, to $30.4 million for 2018 compared with $27.9 million for 2018. This increase reflects increased core banking system charges due to an increase in the number of accounts being processed by our core banking system as a result of the Atlantic and Hamilton acquisitions and additional software fees related to the buildout of our BSA compliance program, partially offset by a $1.4 million refund recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to overcharges on prior billings from a data processing vendor.\nA loan is placed on non-accrual status when, in management's judgment, the collection of the interest income appears doubtful. Interest receivable that has been accrued in prior years and is subsequently determined to have doubtful collectability is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Interest on loans that are classified as non-accrual is recognized when received. Past due loans are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. In some cases, where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties, loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the original contractual terms. The following table presents an analysis of loans accounted for on a non-accrual basis and loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments and still accruing, excluding purchased loans.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had a balance of $14.1 million and $11.1 million, respectively, in troubled debt restructurings, excluding purchased loans. The following table presents the amount of troubled debt restructurings by loan class, excluding purchased loans, classified separately as accrual and non-accrual at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable

calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR, and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. The Company has material contracts that are indexed to LIBOR, which include certain financial instruments within investment securities, loans, other borrowings, subordinated deferrable interest debentures and derivative financial instruments. Company management is monitoring this development in the financial markets and is evaluating the related risks.

The interest rate-sensitivity gap is the difference between the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within such time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate-sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities exceeds the interest rate-sensitive assets. During a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income, while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income, while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income. If our assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently, the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal.\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Accruing Loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Non-Accruing Loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan Class </td> <td> </td> <td># </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td># </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial, financial and agricultural </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - construction and development </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>872 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - commercial and farmland </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,712 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - residential </td> <td> </td> <td>114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,069 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,106 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer installment </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,141 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2018 was $347.5 million, compared with $267.1 million in 2017, an increase of $80.4 million, or 30.1%.

Total noninterest expense increased $178.3 million, or 60.7%, in 2019 to $471.9 million from $293.6 million in 2018. Total noninterest expense for 2019 include approximately $73.1 million in merger-related charges, $6.0 million in losses on sale of bank premises, $245,000 in restructuring charges, ($39,000) in financial impact of hurricanes charges, and $463,000 in expenses related to the previously announced SEC and DOJ investigation. Total noninterest expense for 2018 includes approximately $20.5 million in merger-related charges, $8.4 million in executive retirement benefits, $983,000 in restructuring charges, $882,000 in financial impact of hurricanes and $1.0 million in losses on sale of bank premises. Excluding these amounts, expenses in 2019 increased by $130.3 million, or 49.8%, compared with 2018 levels.\nThe insurance agent relationships, the \"US Premium Finance\" trade name and non-compete agreement intangible assets acquired in the USPF acquisition are based on the established values as of the acquisition date and are being amortized over estimated useful lives of eight years, seven years and three years, respectively.\nNo less frequently than quarterly for mortgage servicing rights and semi-annually for all other servicing rights, management reviews the status of all loans and pools of loans sold with related capitalized servicing assets to determine if there is any impairment to those assets due to such factors as earlier than estimated repayments or significant prepayments. Any impairment identified in these assets will result in reductions in their carrying values through a valuation allowance and a corresponding increase in operating expenses.\nWe manage the mix of asset and liability maturities in an effort to control the effects of changes in the general level of interest rates on net interest income. Except for its effect on the general level of interest rates, inflation does not have a material impact on the balance sheet due to the rate variability and short-term maturities of its earning assets. In particular, approximately 39.7% of earning assets mature or reprice within one year or less. Mortgage loans, generally our loan category with the longest maturity, are usually made with fifteen to thirty year maturities, but a portion is at a variable interest rate with an adjustment between origination date and maturity date.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Predetermined interest rates </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,939,752 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Floating or adjustable interest rates </td> <td>3,271,642 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,211,394 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nestablishing allowances, management considers historical loan loss experience but adjusts this data with a significant emphasis on data such as current loan quality trends, current economic conditions and other factors in the markets where the Bank operates.

The Company's look-back period for historical losses is 16 quarters. Current period losses are lower than those incurred four years ago, which has reduced the need in the allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of loans, at December 31, 2019, as compared with prior periods. The Company's qualitative factors currently utilized in determining the allowance for loan losses are generally lower than those at December 31, 2018, with limited increases in certain segments primarily driven by portfolio growth rates. Additionally, a significant portion of the Company's loan growth during 2019 consisted of residential mortgage loans, funded balances on residential mortgage warehouse lines of credit and commercial real estate loans, each of which the Company has experienced low levels of loss. The growth in lower-risk loans during 2019, combined with the improved historical loss rates and qualitative factors on certain portfolios, are the primary reasons the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans, excluding purchased loans and purchased loan pools, remained stable at 0.46% at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities; management considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from the judgments and estimates adopted by management which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations. We believe the following accounting policies applied by Ameris represent critical accounting policies.\nThe balance of the allowance for loan losses allocated to loans collectively evaluated for impairment increased 30.1%, or $7.2 million, during the year ended December 31, 2019, while the balance of loans collectively evaluated for impairment increased 50.6%, or $4.23 billion, during the same period, reflecting the acquisition of Fidelity and organic loan growth. For legacy loans, increases in the loss rate on commercial, financial and agricultural loans and qualitative factors on residential real estate loans offset improvements in either qualitative factors or loss rates on other portfolios. A significant portion of the legacy loan growth during 2019 was concentrated in commercial real estate, residential mortgage loans and funded balances on residential mortgage warehouse lines of credit, each of which the Company has experienced low rates of loss on. We consider a four year loss rate on all loan categories and our charge off ratio has been steadily declining over that period. We have adjusted the qualitative factors to account for the inherent risks in the portfolio that are not captured in the historical loss rates, such as commodity prices for agriculture products, growth rates of certain loan types and other factors management deems appropriate. As a percentage of all loans collectively evaluated for impairment, the allowance allocated to those loans decreased three basis points, from 0.28% at December 31, 2018 to 0.25% at December 31, 2019. The largest increase in allowance allocated to loans collectively evaluated for impairment as a percentage of the related loans was noted in legacy residential real estate and commercial, financial, and agricultural loan categories. The allowance allocated to residential real estate loans evaluated collectively for impairment increased from 0.32% at December 31, 2018 to 0.36% at December 31, 2019 reflecting the elevated growth rate for this loan category. The allowance allocated to commercial, financial and agricultural loans evaluated collectively for impairment increased from 0.28% at December 31, 2018 to 0.32% at December 31, 2019 due to an increase in historical net chargeoffs for this loan category.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial, financial and agricultural </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,546 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - construction and development </td> <td> </td> <td>140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,612 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - commercial and farmland </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,226 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate - residential </td> <td> </td> <td>29,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,038 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer installment </td> <td> </td> <td>204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total covered loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137,529 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the various loan types comprising the \"Commercial, financial and agricultural\" loan category displayed in the preceding table.\nLiquidity management involves the matching of the cash flow requirements of customers, who may be either depositors desiring to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs, and the ability of our Company to meet those needs.

This increase was a result of both the Fidelity acquisition and additional growth from the low interest rate environment during the second half of 2019. Total production in the retail mortgage division increased to $4.3 billion for 2019, compared with $1.8 billion for 2018, while gain on sale spreads decreased in 2019 to 2.75% from 2.92% in 2018. The decrease in gain on sale spread is primarily related to a shift in product mix and transition of the Fidelity pricing model through conversion. Noninterest income from the Company's warehouse lending division was approximately flat at $2.0 million for 2019 compared with 2018.\nAmortization of intangible assets increased $5.6 million, or 141.9%, to $9.5 million for 2018 compared with $3.9 million for 2017 due to additional amortization of intangible assets recorded as part of the USPF, Atlantic and Hamilton acquisitions.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges on deposit accounts </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,054 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking activities </td> <td> </td> <td>119,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,535 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other service charges, commissions and fees </td> <td> </td> <td>3,913 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,883 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain (loss) on securities </td> <td> </td> <td>138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of SBA loans </td> <td> </td> <td>6,058 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,590 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other noninterest income </td> <td> </td> <td>17,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,358 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>198,113 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,457 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recorded net income of $61.2 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared with $43.5 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, and $9.2 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank initially records purchased loans at fair value, taking into consideration certain credit quality risk and interest rate risk. The Company believes its estimation of credit risk and its adjustments to the carrying balances of the acquired loans is adequate. If the Company determines that a loan or group of loans has deteriorated from its initial assessment of fair value, additional provision for loan loss expense will be recorded for the impairment in value. If the Company determines that a loan or group of loans has improved from its initial assessment of fair value, then the increase in cash flows over those expected at the acquisition date will result in a reversal of provision for loan loss expense to the extent of prior provisions or will be recognized as interest income prospectively if no provisions have been made or have been fully reversed.\nDEPOSITS\nSubsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses. Cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Cash receipts on impaired loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied first to principal and then to interest income.\nOccupancy costs increased $5.1 million, or 21.03%, from $24.1 million in 2017 to $29.1 million in 2018 due primarily to 28 branch locations being added during 2018 as a result of the Atlantic and Hamilton acquisitions.\nBALANCE SHEET COMPARISON\nTable

During 2019, the Company's capital increased $1.01 billion, primarily due to the issuance of Common Stock of $869.3 million and net income of $161.4 million, which amounts were partially offset by the cash dividends declared on common shares of $30.4 million and treasury stock purchases of $18.4 million. During 2018, the Company's capital increased $547.1 million, primarily due to the issuance of Common Stock of $547.1 million and net income of $121.0 million, which amounts were partially offset by the cash dividends declared on common shares of $17.4 million. For both 2019 and 2018, other capital related transactions, such as other comprehensive income, share-based compensation, common stock issuances through the exercise of stock options, and issuances of shares of restricted stock accounted for only a small change in the capital of the Company.\n\nQUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was $38.2 million, or 0.30% of loans compared with $28.8 million, or 0.34%, and $25.8 million, or 0.43%, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding purchased loans and purchased loan pools, the Company's allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was $34.3 million, or 0.46% of loans, compared with $26.2 million, or 0.46%, and $21.5 million, or 0.44%, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company experienced growth in all non-purchased loan segments in 2019 except consumer installment loans which decreased slightly. The allowance as a percentage of loans, excluding purchased loans and purchased loan pools, at December 31, 2019 remained stable compared with December 31, 2018, as increases in the loss rate on commercial, financial and agricultural loans and qualitative factors on residential real estate loans offset improvements in either qualitative factors or loss rates on other portfolios. A significant portion of the Company's loan growth during 2019 consisted of commercial real estate, residential mortgage loans and funded balances on residential mortgage warehouse lines of credit, each of which the Company has experienced low rates of loss.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInterest expense on deposits and other borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $131.2 million, an increase of $61.3 million, or 87.6%, compared with $69.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. During 2019 average interest-bearing liabilities were $9.13 billion as compared with $6.34 billion for 2018, an increase of $2.80 billion, or 44.1%. During 2019, average noninterest-bearing deposit accounts averaged $3.36 billion and comprised 28.8% of average total deposits, compared with $2.16 billion, or 27.5% of average total deposits, during 2018. Average balances of time deposits amounted to $2.70 billion and comprised 23.0% of average total deposits during 2019, compared with $1.67 billion, or 21.2% of average total deposits, during 2018.\n(2)Yields on securities of state and political subdivisions are stated on a taxable-equivalent basis, using a tax rate of 21%.\nCertain economic and interest rate factors could have a material impact on the determination of the allowance for loan losses. An improving economy could result in the expansion of businesses and creation of jobs which would positively affect our loan growth and improve our gross revenue stream. Conversely, certain factors could result from an expanding economy which could increase our credit costs and adversely impact our net earnings. A significant rapid rise in interest rates could create higher borrowing costs and shrinking corporate profits which could have a material impact on a borrower's ability to pay. We will continue to concentrate on maintaining a high quality loan portfolio through strict administration of our loan policy.\nManagement evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Substantially all of the unrealized losses on debt securities are related to changes in interest rates and do not affect the expected cash flows of the issuer or underlying collateral. All unrealized losses are considered temporary because each security carries an acceptable investment grade, the Company has the intent and ability to hold such securities until maturity and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery or maturity. The Company's investments in subordinated debt include investments in regional and super-regional banks on which the Company conducts regular analysis through review of financial information or credit ratings. Investments in preferred securities are also concentrated in the preferred obligations of regional and super-regional banks through non-pooled investment structures. The Company did not hold any investments in pooled\u201d trust preferred securities at December 31, 2019.\nPurchased Loan Pools\nOther noninterest income increased by $6.5 million, or 102.6%, to $12.8 million during 2018 compared with 2017. This increase was primarily due to $4.5 million in other income recorded to reflect a decrease in the USPF acquisition contingent consideration expected to be paid. Additionally, loan servicing fee income, check order fees, merchant fee income, and income from bank owned life insurance were higher in 2018.\nThe following tables set forth the amount of average balance, interest income or interest expense, and average interest rate for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin on average interest-earning assets. Federally tax-exempt income is presented on a taxable-equivalent basis assuming a 21% federal tax rate for 2019 and 2018 and a 35% federal tax rate for 2017.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had a balance of $21.1 million and $22.2 million, respectively, in troubled debt restructurings included in purchased loans. The following table presents the amount of troubled debt restructurings by loan class of purchased loans, classified separately as accrual and non-accrual at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses, provision for loan losses and net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\n\nGain on sale of SBA loans decreased by $1.9 million, or 40.6%, to $2.7 million during 2018 compared with 2017, reflecting a 33.2% reduction in SBA loans sold during 2018 compared with 2017.\nPurchased loans are defined as loans that are acquired in bank acquisitions including those acquisitions covered by the loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC. Purchased loans totaled $5.08 billion and $2.59 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Purchased OREO is defined as OREO that was acquired in bank acquisitions including those acquisitions covered by the loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC. Purchased OREO totaled $15.0 million and $9.5 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAmortization of intangible assets increased $8.2 million, or 86.2%, to $17.7 million for 2019 compared with $9.5 million for 2018 due to additional amortization of intangible assets recorded as part of the USPF, Atlantic, Hamilton and Fidelity acquisitions.\nAssets Covered by Loss-Sharing Agreements with the FDIC\n1 A reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures can be found in following table.\nGain on sale of SBA loans increased by $3.3 million, or 122.1%, to $6.1 million during 2019 compared with 2018, reflecting an 118.1% increase in SBA loans sold during 2019 compared with 2018.\n\nInterest expense on deposits and other borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $69.9 million, an increase of $35.7 million, or 104.4%, compared with $34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. During 2018 average interest-bearing liabilities were $6.34 billion as compared with $4.85 billion for 2017, an increase of $1.48 billion, or 30.6%. During 2018, average noninterest-bearing accounts amounted to $2.16 billion and comprised 27.5% of average total deposits, compared with $1.67 billion, or 28.6% of average total deposits, during 2017. Average balances of time deposits amounted to $1.67 billion and comprised 21.2% of average total deposits during 2018, compared with $1.00 billion, or 17.2% of average total deposits, during 2017.\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\u2022Organic growth in loans of $751.8 million, or 9.2%, compared with $482.6 million, or 8.5%, in 2018\n\nThe following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated. Management believes the allowance can be allocated only on an approximate basis. The allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any other category.\nWe have a large, stable base of time deposits with little or no dependence on what we consider volatile deposits. Volatile deposits, in management's opinion, are those deposit accounts that are overly rate sensitive and apt to move if our rate offerings are not at or near the top of the market. Generally speaking, these are brokered deposits or time deposits in amount greater than $100,000.\nOFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nLIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY\nThe following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and net charge-offs for legacy loans, purchased loans,\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets purchased in business combinations. Goodwill is required to be tested annually for impairment or whenever events occur that may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount is not probable. In the event of an impairment, the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value is charged to earnings. The Company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year.\nWe sell residential mortgage and SBA loans with servicing retained. We have also assumed servicing of loans sold with servicing retained, primarily indirect automobile loan pools, in prior acquisitions. When the contractual servicing fees on loans sold with servicing retained are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer for performing the servicing, a capitalized servicing asset is recognized. Servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized into non-interest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. Management makes certain estimates and assumptions related to costs to service varying types of loans and pools of loans, the projected lives of loans and pools of loans sold, and discount factors used in calculating the present values of servicing fees projected to be received.\nOther professional fees decreased $9.5 million, or 67.4%, from $14.1 million in 2017 to $4.6 million in 2018, primarily due to a $5.5 million reduction in fees incurred in the premium finance division pursuant to the USPF management and license agreement which were discontinued after completion of the USPF acquisition on January 31, 2018 coupled with a $5.2 million reduction in consulting fees related to our BSA compliance function.\n\nServicing Assets\n\n\nThe allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses is based on management's evaluation of the size and composition of the loan portfolio, the level of non-performing and past due loans, historical trends of charged-off loans and recoveries, prevailing economic conditions and other factors management deems appropriate. As these factors change, the level of loan loss provision may change.\n\nThe following table presents the amount of troubled debt restructurings, excluding purchased loans, by collateral types, classified separately as accrual and non-accrual at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nIncome from mortgage banking activities increased $5.1 million, or 10.5%, to $53.7 million during 2018 compared with 2017. Retail mortgage revenues increased $11.2 million, or 18.5%, during 2018, from $60.5 million for 2017 to $71.7 million for 2018. Net income for the Company's retail mortgage division grew 35.9% during 2018 to $16.5 million. Revenues from the Company's warehouse lending division increased $3.5 million, or 45.9%, during the year, from $7.6 million for 2017 to $11.1 million for 2018. Net income for the warehouse lending division increased $3.7 million, or 86.8%, during 2018, from $4.3 million for 2017 to $8.1 million for 2018.\nThe amount of purchased loans outstanding, at the indicated dates, is shown in the following table according to type of loan.\nCovered loans are shown below according to loan type as of the end of the years shown (in thousands).\n\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation.\n2018 compared with 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, interest income was $413.3 million, an increase of $119.0 million, or 40.4%, compared with the same period in 2017. Average earning assets increased $2.10 billion, or 31.1%, to $8.86 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with $6.76 billion as of December 31, 2017. Yield on average earning assets on a taxable equivalent basis increased during 2018 to 4.71%, compared with 4.46% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Average yields on all interest-earning asset categories increased from 2017 to 2018 with the exception of purchased loans, which experienced a decrease from 5.96% in 2017 to 5.72% in 2018.\n2019 compared with 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, interest income was $636.4 million, an increase of $223.1 million, or 54.0%, compared with the same period in 2018. Average earning assets increased $4.27 billion, or 48.2%, to $13.13 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with $8.86 billion for 2018. Yield on average earning assets on a taxable equivalent basis increased during 2019 to 4.88%, compared with 4.71% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Average yields on all interest-earning asset categories increased from 2018 to 2019 with the exception of loans held for sale, which experienced a decrease from 4.07% in 2018 to 3.75% in 2019.\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\n2019 compared with 2018. Total noninterest income in 2019 was $198.1 million, compared with $118.4 million in 2018, reflecting an increase of 67.3%, or $79.7 million.\nA simple interest rate gap\u201d analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Accordingly, the ALCO Committee also evaluates how the repayment of particular assets and liabilities is impacted by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may not react identically to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps\u201d) which limit changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase.\n(1)Yields were computed using coupon interest, adding discount accretion or subtracting premium amortization, as appropriate, on a ratable basis over the life of each security. The weighted average yield for each maturity range was computed using the amortized cost of each security in that range.\nNoninterest Income\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThe amounts of securities available for sale in each category as of December 31, 2019 are shown in the following table according to contractual maturity classifications: (i) one year or less, (ii) after one year through five years, (iii) after five years through ten years and (iv) after ten years.\nIncome Taxes\n\nAmortization periods for intangible assets are reviewed annually in connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill.\nThe amount of loans outstanding, excluding purchased loans, at the indicated dates is shown in the following table according to type of loans.\n\nNet Interest Income\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had a cash flow hedge that matures September 15, 2020 with a notional amount of $37.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, for the purpose of converting the variable rate on the junior subordinated debentures to a fixed rate of 4.11%. The interest rate swap, which is classified as a cash flow hedge, is indexed to 90-Day LIBOR.\nService charges on deposit accounts increased by $4.7 million, or 10.1%, to $50.8 million during 2019 compared with 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to the Fidelity acquisition which closed on July 1, 2019 and the full year impact of the Atlantic and Hamilton acquisitions which both closed during the second quarter of 2018. Maintenance service charges on deposits and non-sufficient funds/overdraft charges both increased during 2019 while interchange income decreased slightly due to the impact of the Durbin Amendment beginning in the third quarter of 2019.\nCapital Regulations\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated quarterly financial information of the Company. This information is derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements, which include, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods.\nThe following table summarizes short-term borrowings for the periods indicated.\nEARNING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nThe summary of changes in interest income and interest expense on a fully taxable equivalent basis resulting from changes in volume and changes in rates for each category of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are shown in the following table:\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOther noninterest expense increased $17.9 million, or 50.2%, to $53.5 million in 2019 from $35.6 million in 2018, resulting primarily from increases in loss on sale of bank premises, ATM expenses, loan servicing expense, and deposit account charge-offs, partially offset by a decrease in hurricane related expenses and debit card charge-offs. Also contributing to the increase was an increase in variable expenses related to our elevated mortgage production.\nThe following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2019, the interest rate sensitivity gap (i.e., interest rate sensitive assets minus interest rate sensitive liabilities), the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap, the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio (i.e., interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitive liabilities) and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio. The table also sets forth the time periods in which earning assets and liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms. However, the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers. In addition, various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times within such period and at different rates.\nThe required CET1 Ratio, Tier 1 Capital Ratio, and the Total Capital Ratio reflected in the table above include a capital conservation buffer of 2.50%.\nNET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE\nTotal legacy loans, excluding purchased loans, as of December 31, 2019, are shown in the following table according to their contractual maturity.\n\u2022Continued management of nonperforming assets, approximately flat at 0.56% of total assets compared with 2018\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nConsidering current information and events regarding a borrower's ability to repay its obligations, management considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectability of all amounts due, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, is in doubt. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or if the loan is collateral-dependent, the fair value of the collateral is used to determine the amount of impairment. Impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for loan losses.\nAt December 31, 2019, estimated costs to complete construction projects in progress and other binding commitments for capital expenditures were not a material amount.\n\n\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as the provision for loan losses and gains on FDIC-\nIn accordance with risk capital guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve, we are required to maintain a minimum standard of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%. Additionally, all member banks must maintain core\u201d or Tier 1\u201d capital of at least 4% of total assets ( leverage ratio\u201d). Member banks operating at or near the 4% capital level are expected to have well-diversified risks, including no undue interest rate risk exposure, excellent control systems, good earnings, high asset quality and well managed on- and off-balance sheet activities, and, in general, be considered strong banking organizations with a composite 1 rating under the CAMEL rating system of banks. For all but the most highly rated banks meeting the above conditions, the minimum leverage ratio is to be 4% plus an additional 1% to 2%.\nLong-Lived Assets, Including Intangibles\nSalaries and benefits increased $29.3 million, or 24.5%, from $119.8 million in 2017 to $149.1 million in 2018. This increase was attributable to $8.4 million in expense related to executive retirement benefits coupled with higher incentive pay, increased share-based compensation expense and increased investment in the Company's BSA function, as well as staff additions resulting from the Atlantic acquisition and the Hamilton acquisition both of which closed during the second quarter of 2018. Full time equivalent employees increased from 1,460 at December 31, 2017 to 1,804 at December 31, 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the regulatory capital levels of Ameris at December 31, 2019.\nThe Company seeks to diversify its loan portfolio across its geographic footprint and in various loan types. Also, the Company's in-house lending limit for a single loan is $40.0 million, which would normally prevent a concentration with a single loan project. Certain lending relationships may contain more than one loan and, consequently, exceed the in-house lending limit. The Company regularly monitors its largest loan relationships to avoid a concentration with a single borrower. The largest 25 loan relationships as of December 31, 2019 based on committed amount are summarized below by type.\nCAPITAL ADEQUACY\nIn the ordinary course of business, our Bank has granted commitments to extend credit to approved customers. Generally, these commitments to extend credit have been granted on a temporary basis for seasonal or inventory requirements or for construction period financing and have been approved within the Bank's credit guidelines. Our Bank has also granted commitments to approved customers for financial standby letters of credit. These commitments are recorded in the financial statements when funds are disbursed or the financial instruments become payable. The Bank uses the same credit policies for these off-balance-sheet commitments as it does for financial instruments that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitment amounts expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\n\nassisted transactions, for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe have developed a methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses which is monitored by the Company's Chief Credit Officer. Procedures provide for the assignment of a risk rating for every loan included in the total loan portfolio. Commercial insurance premium loans, overdraft protection loans and certain mortgage loans and consumer loans serviced by outside processors are treated as pools for risk rating purposes. The risk rating schedule provides nine ratings of which five ratings are classified as pass ratings and four ratings are classified as criticized ratings. Each risk rating is assigned a percent factor to be applied to the loan balance to determine the adequate amount of allowance. Relationships in excess of $2.0 million require an annual review and are generally performed by someone independent of the loan officer. Those reviews are approved by Regional Credit Officers and are often reviewed by independent third parties, such as auditors, regulators or loan review. As a result of these loan reviews, certain loans may be assigned specific allowance allocations. Other loans that surface as problem loans may also be assigned specific allowance allocations. Assigned risk ratings can be adjusted based on the number of days past due. The calculation of the allowance for loan losses, including underlying data and assumptions, is reviewed regularly by the independent internal loan review department.\nPurchased loan pools are defined as groups of residential mortgage loans that were not acquired in bank acquisitions or FDIC-assisted transactions. As of December 31, 2019, purchased loan pools totaled $213.2 million and consisted of whole-loan, adjustable rate residential mortgages on properties outside the Company's markets, with principal balances totaling $212.4 million and $811,000 of remaining purchase premium paid at acquisition. As of December 31, 2018, purchased loan pools totaled $262.6 million with principal balances totaling $260.5 million and $2.1 million of remaining purchase premium paid at acquisition. As of December 31, 2017, purchased loan pools totaled $328.2 million with principal balances totaling $324.4 million and $3.8 million of remaining purchase premium paid at acquisition. As of December 31, 2016, purchased loan pools totaled $568.3 million with principal balances totaling $559.4 million and $8.9 million of remaining purchase premium paid at acquisition. As of December 31, 2015, purchased loan pools totaled $593.0 million with principal balances totaling $580.7 million and $12.3 million of remaining purchase premium paid at acquisition. At December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015 the Company has allocated approximately $624,000, $732,000, $1.1 million, $1.8 million and $581,000, respectively, of the allowance for loan losses to the purchased loan pools.\nAs required by GAAP, we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. See Note 14, Income Taxes,\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nIntangible assets include core deposit premiums from various past bank acquisitions as well as intangible assets recorded in connection with the USPF acquisition for insurance agent relationships, the \"US Premium Finance\" trade name and a non-compete agreement.\nMerger and conversion charges of $20.5 million in 2018 reflect an increase of $19.6 million, compared with $915,000 recorded in 2017. Merger and conversion charges were elevated in 2018 due to the acquisitions of USPF, Atlantic and Hamilton during 2018, as well as the conversion of both Atlantic and Hamilton to our core system during 2018.\nAverage earning assets were approximately $13.13 billion in 2019, compared with approximately $8.86 billion in 2018. The earning asset and interest-bearing liability mix is regularly monitored to maximize the net interest margin and, therefore, increase return on assets and shareholders' equity.\nA substantial portion of our loan portfolio is in the commercial real estate and residential real estate sectors. The majority of these loans are secured by real estate in our primary market areas. A substantial portion of OREO is located in those same markets. Therefore, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of our loan portfolio and the recoverability of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of OREO are susceptible to changes to market conditions in our primary market area.\n\u2022Annualized net charge-offs of 0.10% of average total loans and 0.15% of average non-purchased loans\n2018 compared with 2017. Total noninterest expense increased $61.7 million, or 26.6%, in 2018 to $293.6 million from $231.9 million in 2017. Total noninterest expense for 2018 include approximately $20.5 million in merger-related charges, $8.4 million in executive retirement benefits expense, $983,000 in restructuring charges, $882,000 in Hurricane Michael charges, $1.0 million in losses on sale of bank premises. Total noninterest expense for 2017 includes approximately $915,000 in merger-related charges, $5.2 million in compliance-related charges, $410,000 in Hurricane Irma charges and $1.3 million in losses on sale of bank premises. Excluding these amounts, expenses in 2018 increased by $37.6 million, or 16.8%, compared with 2017 levels.\nIncluded in purchased loans above are loans that were acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions that are covered by the loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC ( covered loans\u201d) totaling $30.3 million and $38.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. OREO that is covered by the loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC totaled $36,000 and $424,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The loss-sharing agreements are subject to the servicing procedures as specified in the agreements with the FDIC. The expected reimbursements under the loss-sharing agreements were recorded as an indemnification asset at their estimated fair value at the respective acquisition dates. The net FDIC loss-share payable reported at December 31, 2019 was $19.6 million which includes the clawback liability of $20.4 million the Bank expects to pay to the FDIC. The net FDIC loss-share payable reported at December 31, 2018 was $19.5 million which includes the clawback liability of $19.5 million the Bank expects to pay to the FDIC.\n\nAssets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of purchased assets or assumed liabilities. On the date of acquisition, when the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. The Company must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield which will have a positive impact on future interest income.\nAverage amount of various deposit classes and the average rates paid thereon are presented below.\nWe must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or adjust this allowance in a period, we must include an expense within the tax provisions in the statement of income.\n\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had brokered deposits of $452.7 million. The amounts of time certificates of deposit issued in amounts of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2019, are shown below by category, which is based on time remaining until maturity of (i) three months or less, (ii) over three through twelve months and (iii) greater than one year.\nService charges on deposit accounts increased by $4.1 million, or 9.7%, to $46.1 million during 2018 compared with 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to the Atlantic and Hamilton acquisitions which both closed during the second quarter of 2018. All areas of service charges on deposits increased during 2018 including maintenance service charges on deposits, interchange income, and non-sufficient funds/overdraft charges.\nALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES\nThe investment portfolio consists of securities which are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of the related deferred tax effect.\n\nThe Company's provision for loan losses during 2019 amounted to $19.8 million, compared with $16.7 million for 2018 and $8.4 million for 2017. Net charge-offs in 2019 were 0.10% of average loans compared with 0.18% in 2018 and 0.12% in 2017. Net charge-offs in 2019 were 0.15% of average legacy loans, compared with 0.27% in 2018 and 0.13% in 2017. Of the $14.5 million in legacy loan net charge-offs recorded during 2018, approximately $7.2 million, or 49.5%, were charge-offs within the Premium Finance Division stemming from two purchased loan relationships. These two relationships were non-core general operating lines to insurance agencies and were not the traditional premium finance offerings that the Company primarily focuses on. Management notes that both agencies suffered unusual circumstances that precipitated their defaults. Excluding these unusual charge-offs, total net charge-offs for 2018 would have been 0.09% of average total loans and legacy net charge-offs in 2018 would have been 0.14% of average legacy loans. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining balance on those non-core loans totaled $6.8 million.\n2018 compared with 2017. Total noninterest income in 2018 was $118.4 million, compared with $104.5 million in 2017, reflecting an increase of 13.4%, or $14.0 million.", "item_7_text": "\nThe Company's net income during 2019 was $161.4 million, or $2.75 per diluted share, compared with $121.0 million, or $2.80 per diluted share, in 2018, and $73.5 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, in 2017.\nAnother factor that we have considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses is loan concentrations to individual borrowers or industries. Based on total committed exposure at December 31, 2019, we had nine individual loans/lines of credit that exceeded our normal in-house credit limit of $40.0 million. Total exposure from these nine individual loans/lines of credit amounted to $600.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The largest total committed exposure for a single loan/line of credit at December 31, 2019 was $100.0 million, and we had one line of credit at this level extended to a client of our warehouse lending division. As of December 31, 2019, we had 14 relationships consisting of 52 loans/lines of credit that exceeded $40.0 million. Total exposure from these 14 relationships amounted to $874.0 million as of December 31, 2019. The largest total committed exposure for a single relationship at December 31, 2019 was $100.0 million, and we had one relationship at this level which is a client of our warehouse lending division as well. Additional disclosure concerning the Company's largest loan relationships is provided in the Balance Sheet Comparison\u201d section below.\n\nThe following table presents an analysis of purchased loans accounted for on a non-accrual basis and loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments and still accruing.\nWe believe the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable incurred losses in the Company's loan portfolio. Calculation of the allowance for loan losses represents a critical accounting estimate due to the significant judgment, assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses, consideration of subjective environmental factors and the amount and timing of cash flows related to impaired loans.\n\u2022Adjusted return on average assets1 of 1.52%, compared with 1.50% in 2018\n\n\nNet interest income represents the amount by which interest income on interest-earning assets exceeds interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the largest component of our income and is affected by the interest rate environment and the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities, other investments, interest-bearing deposits in banks, federal funds sold and time deposits in other banks. Our interest-bearing liabilities include deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, other borrowings and subordinated deferrable interest debentures.\nThe following table sets forth certain information about contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2019.\nManagement believes that our loan portfolio is adequately diversified. The loan portfolio contains no foreign loans or significant concentrations in any one industry. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 72.1% of our legacy loan portfolio was secured by real estate, compared with 68.7% at December 31, 2018 and 65.2% at December 31, 2017.\n\nOccupancy costs increased $11.5 million, or 39.4%, from $29.1 million in 2018 to $40.6 million in 2019 due primarily to 62 branch locations being added during 2019 as a result of the Fidelity acquisition, partially offset by branch closures related to previously announced branch consolidations.\nOther professional fees increased $4.2 million, or 66.5%, from $6.4 million in 2018 to $10.6 million in 2019, primarily due to consulting fees related to implementation of a new support system and an increase in mortgage consulting related to increases in production volume.\nFollowing is a summary of the carrying value of investment securities available for sale as of the end of each reported period:\nOther noninterest income increased by $4.9 million, or 38.2%, to $17.8 million during 2019 compared with 2018. This increase was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in loan servicing income and a $3.6 million gain on BOLI proceeds due to the unfortunate death of a former officer of Fidelity. Additionally, check order fees, merchant fee income, trust services activities income and income from bank owned life insurance were higher in 2019. These increases were partially offset by $4.5 million in other income recorded during 2018 to reflect a decrease in the USPF acquisition contingent consideration expected to be paid.\nLOANS\nTotal loans (legacy loans, purchased loans and purchased loan pools) which have maturity dates after one year are summarized below by those loans that have predetermined interest rates and those loans that have floating or adjustable interest rates.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans, with a particular emphasis on non-accruing, past due and other loans that management believes might be potentially impaired or warrant additional attention. We segregate our loan portfolio by type of loan and utilize this segregation in evaluating exposure to risks within the portfolio. In addition, based on internal reviews and external reviews performed by independent loan reviewers and regulatory authorities, we further segregate our loan portfolio by loan grades based on an assessment of risk for a particular loan or group of loans. Certain reviewed loans are assigned specific allowances when a review of relevant data determines that a general allocation is not sufficient or when the review affords management the opportunity to fine tune the amount of exposure in a given credit. In\nA principal objective of our asset/liability management strategy is to minimize our exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the maturity and repricing horizons of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. This strategy is overseen in part through the direction of our Asset and Liability Committee (the ALCO Committee\u201d) which establishes policies and monitors results to control interest rate sensitivity.\n\n\n\nManagement believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review the Company's\nOVERVIEW\nPurchased Assets\nThe following table presents the amount of troubled debt restructurings, excluding purchased loans, by types of concessions made, classified separately as accrual and non-accrual at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe valuation of intangible assets involves significant forward looking assumptions such as economic conditions, market interest rates, asset growth rates, credit losses, etc. Changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the valuation of the intangible assets.\nMerger and conversion charges were $73.1 million in 2019, an increase of $52.6 million, or 256.6%, compared with $20.5 million recorded for 2018. Merger and conversion charges in 2019 primarily related to the acquisition of Fidelity while those in 2018 were primarily related to the acquisitions of USPF, Atlantic and Hamilton during 2018, as well as the conversion of both Atlantic and Hamilton to our core system during 2018.\nProvision for Loan Losses\n\nThe following table presents the amount of troubled debt restructurings by loan class of purchased loans, classified separately as those currently paying under restructured terms and those that have defaulted (defined as 30 days past due) under restructured terms at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nThe provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to $19.8 million, compared with $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019 our ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets had increased slightly to 0.56% from 0.55% at December 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nData processing and telecommunications expenses increased $2.5 million, or 9.0%, to $30.4 million for 2018 compared with $27.9 million for 2018. This increase reflects increased core banking system charges due to an increase in the number of accounts being processed by our core banking system as a result of the Atlantic and Hamilton acquisitions and additional software fees related to the buildout of our BSA compliance program, partially offset by a $1.4 million refund recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to overcharges on prior billings from a data processing vendor.\nA loan is placed on non-accrual status when, in management's judgment, the collection of the interest income appears doubtful. Interest receivable that has been accrued in prior years and is subsequently determined to have doubtful collectability is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Interest on loans that are classified as non-accrual is recognized when received. Past due loans are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. In some cases, where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties, loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the original contractual terms. The following table presents an analysis of loans accounted for on a non-accrual basis and loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments and still accruing, excluding purchased loans.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had a balance of $14.1 million and $11.1 million, respectively, in troubled debt restructurings, excluding purchased loans. The following table presents the amount of troubled debt restructurings by loan class, excluding purchased loans, classified separately as accrual and non-accrual at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe restructuring of a loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring\u201d if both (i) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and (ii) the Company has granted a concession.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, which is the authority that regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR, and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. The Company has material contracts that are indexed to LIBOR, which include certain financial instruments within investment securities, loans, other borrowings, subordinated deferrable interest debentures and derivative financial instruments. Company management is monitoring this development in the financial markets and is evaluating the related risks. The Company has established a working committee with representatives from relevant functional areas to inventory the contracts and accounts that are tied to LIBOR and develop a transition plan for the affected items.\n\nHighlights of the Company's performance in 2019 include the following:\nCore deposit premiums acquired in various past bank acquisitions are based on the established value of acquired customer deposits. The core deposit premium is initially recognized based on a valuation performed as of the acquisition date and is amortized over an estimated useful life of seven to ten years.\nThe following table presents the amount of troubled debt restructurings by loan class, excluding purchased loans, classified separately as those currently paying under restructured terms and those that have defaulted (defined as 30 days past due) under restructured terms at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nAt December 31, 2019, non-performing assets amounted to $101.3 million, or 0.56% of total assets, compared with $63.0 million, or 0.55% of total assets, at December 31, 2018. Legacy non-performing assets totaled $39.5 million and $29.4 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Legacy other real estate was approximately $4.5 million as of December 31, 2019, reflecting a 37.7% decrease from the $7.2 million reported at December 31, 2018. Purchased other real estate was $15.0 million at December 31, 2019, reflecting a 57.3% increase from the $9.5 million at December 31, 2018.\nNONPERFORMING LOANS\nAs part of our interest rate risk management policy, the ALCO Committee examines the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive\u201d and monitors its interest rate-sensitivity gap.\u201d An asset or liability is considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within the time period analyzed, usually one year or less. The interest rate-sensitivity gap is the difference between the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within such time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate-sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities exceeds the interest rate-sensitive assets. During a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income, while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income, while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income. If our assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently, the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal.\nOn a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2018 was $347.5 million, compared with $267.1 million in 2017, an increase of $80.4 million, or 30.1%. The Company's net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, decreased three basis points to 3.92% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with 3.95% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Accretion income for 2018 increased to $11.8 million, compared with $10.6 million for 2017.\n\n\n2019 compared with 2018. Total noninterest expense increased $178.3 million, or 60.7%, in 2019 to $471.9 million from $293.6 million in 2018. Total noninterest expense for 2019 include approximately $73.1 million in merger-related charges, $6.0 million in losses on sale of bank premises, $245,000 in restructuring charges, ($39,000) in financial impact of hurricanes charges, and $463,000 in expenses related to the previously announced SEC and DOJ investigation. Total noninterest expense for 2018 includes approximately $20.5 million in merger-related charges, $8.4 million in executive retirement benefits, $983,000 in restructuring charges, $882,000 in financial impact of hurricanes and $1.0 million in losses on sale of bank premises. Excluding these amounts, expenses in 2019 increased by $130.3 million, or 49.8%, compared with 2018 levels.\nThe insurance agent relationships, the \"US Premium Finance\" trade name and non-compete agreement intangible assets acquired in the USPF acquisition are based on the established values as of the acquisition date and are being amortized over estimated useful lives of eight years, seven years and three years, respectively.\nNo less frequently than quarterly for mortgage servicing rights and semi-annually for all other servicing rights, management reviews the status of all loans and pools of loans sold with related capitalized servicing assets to determine if there is any impairment to those assets due to such factors as earlier than estimated repayments or significant prepayments. Any impairment identified in these assets will result in reductions in their carrying values through a valuation allowance and a corresponding increase in operating expenses.\nWe manage the mix of asset and liability maturities in an effort to control the effects of changes in the general level of interest rates on net interest income. Except for its effect on the general level of interest rates, inflation does not have a material impact on the balance sheet due to the rate variability and short-term maturities of its earning assets. In particular, approximately 39.7% of earning assets mature or reprice within one year or less. Mortgage loans, generally our loan category with the longest maturity, are usually made with fifteen to thirty year maturities, but a portion is at a variable interest rate with an adjustment between origination date and maturity date.\nestablishing allowances, management considers historical loan loss experience but adjusts this data with a significant emphasis on data such as current loan quality trends, current economic conditions and other factors in the markets where the Bank operates. Factors considered include, among others, current valuations of real estate in our markets, unemployment rates, the effect of weather conditions on agricultural related entities and other significant local economic events, such as major plant closings.\nINFLATION\nThe Company's methodology for determining whether other-than-temporary impairment losses exist include management considering (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer or underlying collateral of the security, and (iii) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.\nFollowing is a comparison of noninterest expense for 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nThe following table presents the amount of troubled debt restructurings included in purchased loans, by types of concessions made, classified separately as accrual and non-accrual at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nGenerally, the primary contributor to the allowance for loan losses methodology is historical losses by loan type. The Company's look-back period for historical losses is 16 quarters. Current period losses are lower than those incurred four years ago, which has reduced the need in the allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of loans, at December 31, 2019, as compared with prior periods. The Company's qualitative factors currently utilized in determining the allowance for loan losses are generally lower than those at December 31, 2018, with limited increases in certain segments primarily driven by portfolio growth rates. Additionally, a significant portion of the Company's loan growth during 2019 consisted of residential mortgage loans, funded balances on residential mortgage warehouse lines of credit and commercial real estate loans, each of which the Company has experienced low levels of loss. The growth in lower-risk loans during 2019, combined with the improved historical loss rates and qualitative factors on certain portfolios, are the primary reasons the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans, excluding purchased loans and purchased loan pools, remained stable at 0.46% at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Improvement in deposit mix with noninterest bearing deposits representing 29.9% of total deposits at the end of 2019\nAs of December 31, 2019, letters of credit issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank totaling $82.4 million were used to guarantee the Bank's performance related to a portion of its public fund deposit balances.\n\n\u2022Loan-to-deposit ratio at the end of 2019 of 91.4%, compared with 88.2% at the end of 2018\nOther service charges, commission and fees increased by $176,000 to $3.1 million during 2018, an increase of 6.1% compared with 2017 due to an increase in ATM fees.\n\n\u2022Increase in total revenue of 52.3% to $703.3 million\n\u2022Growth in adjusted net earnings1 of $76.7 million, representing a 52.5% increase over 2018\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nData processing and telecommunications expenses increased $8.1 million, or 26.8%, to $38.5 million for 2019 compared with $30.4 million for 2018. This increase reflects increased core banking system charges due to an increase in the number of accounts being processed by our core banking system as a result of the Atlantic, Hamilton and Fidelity acquisitions and a $1.4 million refund recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to overcharges on prior billings from a data processing vendor.\nAmeris has established certain accounting and financial reporting policies to govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) in the preparation of its financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities; management considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from the judgments and estimates adopted by management which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations. We believe the following accounting policies applied by Ameris represent critical accounting policies.\nThe balance of the allowance for loan losses allocated to loans collectively evaluated for impairment increased 30.1%, or $7.2 million, during the year ended December 31, 2019, while the balance of loans collectively evaluated for impairment increased 50.6%, or $4.23 billion, during the same period, reflecting the acquisition of Fidelity and organic loan growth. For legacy loans, increases in the loss rate on commercial, financial and agricultural loans and qualitative factors on residential real estate loans offset improvements in either qualitative factors or loss rates on other portfolios. A significant portion of the legacy loan growth during 2019 was concentrated in commercial real estate, residential mortgage loans and funded balances on residential mortgage warehouse lines of credit, each of which the Company has experienced low rates of loss on. We consider a four year loss rate on all loan categories and our charge off ratio has been steadily declining over that period. We have adjusted the qualitative factors to account for the inherent risks in the portfolio that are not captured in the historical loss rates, such as commodity prices for agriculture products, growth rates of certain loan types and other factors management deems appropriate. As a percentage of all loans collectively evaluated for impairment, the allowance allocated to those loans decreased three basis points, from 0.28% at December 31, 2018 to 0.25% at December 31, 2019. The largest increase in allowance allocated to loans collectively evaluated for impairment as a percentage of the related loans was noted in legacy residential real estate and commercial, financial, and agricultural loan categories. The allowance allocated to residential real estate loans evaluated collectively for impairment increased from 0.32% at December 31, 2018 to 0.36% at December 31, 2019 reflecting the elevated growth rate for this loan category. The allowance allocated to commercial, financial and agricultural loans evaluated collectively for impairment increased from 0.28% at December 31, 2018 to 0.32% at December 31, 2019 due to an increase in historical net chargeoffs for this loan category.\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the various loan types comprising the \"Commercial, financial and agricultural\" loan category displayed in the preceding table.\nLiquidity management involves the matching of the cash flow requirements of customers, who may be either depositors desiring to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs, and the ability of our Company to meet those needs. We seek to meet liquidity requirements primarily through management of short-term investments (principally interest-bearing deposits in banks) and monthly amortizing loans. Another source of liquidity is the repayment of maturing single payment loans. In addition, our Company maintains relationships with correspondent banks, including the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which could provide funds on short notice, if needed.\nOther service charges, commission and fees increased by $854,000 to $3.9 million during 2019, an increase of 27.9% compared with 2018 due primarily to an increase in ATM fees.\n\u2022Net interest margin of 3.88% during 2019, down 4 basis points from 2018 amid challenging interest rate environment\nNoninterest Expense\n\nThe amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recognized in interest income using methods approximating the interest method over the life of the securities. Realized gains and losses, determined on the basis of the cost of specific securities sold, are included in earnings on the trade date. Declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses.\nPurchased loans as of December 31, 2019, are shown below according to their contractual maturity.\nIncome from mortgage banking activities increased $65.8 million, or 122.6%, to $119.4 million during 2019 compared with 2018. This increase was a result of both the Fidelity acquisition and additional growth from the low interest rate environment during the second half of 2019. Total production in the retail mortgage division increased to $4.3 billion for 2019, compared with $1.8 billion for 2018, while gain on sale spreads decreased in 2019 to 2.75% from 2.92% in 2018. The decrease in gain on sale spread is primarily related to a shift in product mix and transition of the Fidelity pricing model through conversion. Noninterest income from the Company's warehouse lending division was approximately flat at $2.0 million for 2019 compared with 2018.\nAmortization of intangible assets increased $5.6 million, or 141.9%, to $9.5 million for 2018 compared with $3.9 million for 2017 due to additional amortization of intangible assets recorded as part of the USPF, Atlantic and Hamilton acquisitions.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recorded net income of $61.2 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared with $43.5 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, and $9.2 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank initially records purchased loans at fair value, taking into consideration certain credit quality risk and interest rate risk. The Company believes its estimation of credit risk and its adjustments to the carrying balances of the acquired loans is adequate. If the Company determines that a loan or group of loans has deteriorated from its initial assessment of fair value, additional provision for loan loss expense will be recorded for the impairment in value. If the Company determines that a loan or group of loans has improved from its initial assessment of fair value, then the increase in cash flows over those expected at the acquisition date will result in a reversal of provision for loan loss expense to the extent of prior provisions or will be recognized as interest income prospectively if no provisions have been made or have been fully reversed.\nDEPOSITS\nSubsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses. Cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Cash receipts on impaired loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied first to principal and then to interest income.\nOccupancy costs increased $5.1 million, or 21.03%, from $24.1 million in 2017 to $29.1 million in 2018 due primarily to 28 branch locations being added during 2018 as a result of the Atlantic and Hamilton acquisitions.\nBALANCE SHEET COMPARISON\nThe following table presents the amount of troubled debt restructurings included in purchased loans, by collateral types, classified separately as accrual and non-accrual at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nFollowing is a comparison of noninterest income for 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nThe following table summarizes commitments outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOn a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2019 was $509.5 million, compared with $347.5 million in 2018, an increase of $162.0 million, or 46.6%. The Company's net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, decreased four basis points to 3.88% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with 3.92% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Accretion income for 2019 increased to $19.9 million, compared with $11.8 million for 2018.\nSalaries and benefits increased $74.8 million, or 50.2%, from $149.1 million in 2018 to $223.9 million in 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to staff additions resulting from the Fidelity acquisition which closed at the beginning of the third quarter of 2019 and an increase in variable pay resulting from increased production levels in our retail mortgage division. Full time equivalent employees increased from 1,804 at December 31, 2018 to 2,722 at December 31, 2019.\n\nAt December 31, 2019, the allowance for loan losses allocated to legacy loans totaled $34.3 million, or 0.46% of legacy loans, compared with $26.2 million, or 0.46% of legacy loans, at December 31, 2018. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of legacy loans over the past several years reflects the change in credit risk of our portfolio, both from the mix of loan and collateral types, as well as the overall improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio. Our legacy nonaccrual loans increased from $18.0 million at December 31, 2018 to $29.3 million at December 31, 2019. Legacy nonaccrual loans as a percentage of legacy loans increased from 0.32% at December 31, 2018 to 0.39% at December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our legacy net charge off ratio as a percentage of average legacy loans decreased to 0.15%, compared with 0.27% for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded legacy net charge-offs totaling $10.3 million, compared with $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDuring 2019, the Company reported net income of $161.4 million, or $2.75 per diluted share, compared with $121.0 million, or $2.80 per diluted share, in 2018. The Company's net income as a percentage of average assets for 2019 and 2018 was 1.10% and 1.24%, respectively, while the Company's net income as a percentage of average shareholders' equity was 8.19% and 10.27%, respectively. Reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes $73.1 million in merger and conversion charges, primarily related to the acquisition of Fidelity, compared with $20.5 million for 2018, primarily related to the acquisitions of Hamilton, Atlantic and USPF.\nThe final rules implementing Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. banks ( Basel III rules\u201d) became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in over a multi-year schedule, and fully phased in by January 1, 2019. Under the Basel III rules, the Company must hold a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized risk-based capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in from 0.0% for 2015 to 2.50% by 2019. The capital conservation buffer was 0.625% for 2016, 1.250% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018 and 2.50% for 2019.\npurchased loan pools and total loans held for investment.\nOther noninterest expense increased $7.3 million, or 25.8%, to $35.6 million in 2018 from $28.3 million in 2017, resulting primarily from increases in loan servicing expense, debit card charge-offs, natural disaster expenses related to Hurricane Michael, and servicing asset amortization expense, partially offset by a decrease in loan expense.\nThe balance of the allowance for loan losses allocated to loans individually evaluated for impairment increased 44.3%, or $2.2 million, during the year ended December 31, 2019, while the balance of loans individually evaluated for impairment increased 53.0%, or $28.6 million during the same period. The increase in the allowance for loan losses allocated to loans individually evaluated for impairment was primarily attributable to purchased loans. The increase in the balance of loans individually evaluated for impairment was primarily attributable to purchased loans and a small number of residential real estate and commercial, financial and agricultural loans.\nallowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.\nIncome tax expense is influenced by statutory federal and state tax rates, the amount of taxable income, the amount of tax-exempt income and the amount of non-deductible expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded income tax expense of approximately $50.1 million, compared with $30.5 million recorded in 2018 and $50.7 million recorded in 2017. The Company's effective tax rate was 23.7%, 20.1% and 40.8% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a charge of approximately $13.6 million to income tax expense attributable to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities due to federal tax legislation that reduced the Company's future federal corporate tax rate. Excluding this remeasurement charge, income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have been $37.1 million and the Company's effective tax rate would have been approximately 29.9%.\nThe following statistical information should be read in conjunction with the remainder of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report and in the documents incorporated herein by reference.\n\u2022Adjusted return on average tangible common equity1 of 18.74%, compared with 19.18% in 2018\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO\nThe capital resources of the Company are monitored on a periodic basis by state and federal regulatory authorities. During 2019, the Company's capital increased $1.01 billion, primarily due to the issuance of Common Stock of $869.3 million and net income of $161.4 million, which amounts were partially offset by the cash dividends declared on common shares of $30.4 million and treasury stock purchases of $18.4 million. During 2018, the Company's capital increased $547.1 million, primarily due to the issuance of Common Stock of $547.1 million and net income of $121.0 million, which amounts were partially offset by the cash dividends declared on common shares of $17.4 million. For both 2019 and 2018, other capital related transactions, such as other comprehensive income, share-based compensation, common stock issuances through the exercise of stock options, and issuances of shares of restricted stock accounted for only a small change in the capital of the Company.\n\nQUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was $38.2 million, or 0.30% of loans compared with $28.8 million, or 0.34%, and $25.8 million, or 0.43%, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding purchased loans and purchased loan pools, the Company's allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 was $34.3 million, or 0.46% of loans, compared with $26.2 million, or 0.46%, and $21.5 million, or 0.44%, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company experienced growth in all non-purchased loan segments in 2019 except consumer installment loans which decreased slightly. The allowance as a percentage of loans, excluding purchased loans and purchased loan pools, at December 31, 2019 remained stable compared with December 31, 2018, as increases in the loss rate on commercial, financial and agricultural loans and qualitative factors on residential real estate loans offset improvements in either qualitative factors or loss rates on other portfolios. A significant portion of the Company's loan growth during 2019 consisted of commercial real estate, residential mortgage loans and funded balances on residential mortgage warehouse lines of credit, each of which the Company has experienced low rates of loss.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInterest expense on deposits and other borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $131.2 million, an increase of $61.3 million, or 87.6%, compared with $69.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. During 2019 average interest-bearing liabilities were $9.13 billion as compared with $6.34 billion for 2018, an increase of $2.80 billion, or 44.1%. During 2019, average noninterest-bearing deposit accounts averaged $3.36 billion and comprised 28.8% of average total deposits, compared with $2.16 billion, or 27.5% of average total deposits, during 2018. Average balances of time deposits amounted to $2.70 billion and comprised 23.0% of average total deposits during 2019, compared with $1.67 billion, or 21.2% of average total deposits, during 2018.\n(2)Yields on securities of state and political subdivisions are stated on a taxable-equivalent basis, using a tax rate of 21%.\nCertain economic and interest rate factors could have a material impact on the determination of the allowance for loan losses. An improving economy could result in the expansion of businesses and creation of jobs which would positively affect our loan growth and improve our gross revenue stream. Conversely, certain factors could result from an expanding economy which could increase our credit costs and adversely impact our net earnings. A significant rapid rise in interest rates could create higher borrowing costs and shrinking corporate profits which could have a material impact on a borrower's ability to pay. We will continue to concentrate on maintaining a high quality loan portfolio through strict administration of our loan policy.\nManagement evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Substantially all of the unrealized losses on debt securities are related to changes in interest rates and do not affect the expected cash flows of the issuer or underlying collateral. All unrealized losses are considered temporary because each security carries an acceptable investment grade, the Company has the intent and ability to hold such securities until maturity and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery or maturity. The Company's investments in subordinated debt include investments in regional and super-regional banks on which the Company conducts regular analysis through review of financial information or credit ratings. Investments in preferred securities are also concentrated in the preferred obligations of regional and super-regional banks through non-pooled investment structures. The Company did not hold any investments in pooled\u201d trust preferred securities at December 31, 2019.\nPurchased Loan Pools\nOther noninterest income increased by $6.5 million, or 102.6%, to $12.8 million during 2018 compared with 2017. This increase was primarily due to $4.5 million in other income recorded to reflect a decrease in the USPF acquisition contingent consideration expected to be paid. Additionally, loan servicing fee income, check order fees, merchant fee income, and income from bank owned life insurance were higher in 2018.\nThe following tables set forth the amount of average balance, interest income or interest expense, and average interest rate for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, net interest spread and net interest margin on average interest-earning assets. Federally tax-exempt income is presented on a taxable-equivalent basis assuming a 21% federal tax rate for 2019 and 2018 and a 35% federal tax rate for 2017.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had a balance of $21.1 million and $22.2 million, respectively, in troubled debt restructurings included in purchased loans. The following table presents the amount of troubled debt restructurings by loan class of purchased loans, classified separately as accrual and non-accrual at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses, provision for loan losses and net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\n\nGain on sale of SBA loans decreased by $1.9 million, or 40.6%, to $2.7 million during 2018 compared with 2017, reflecting a 33.2% reduction in SBA loans sold during 2018 compared with 2017.\nPurchased loans are defined as loans that are acquired in bank acquisitions including those acquisitions covered by the loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC. Purchased loans totaled $5.08 billion and $2.59 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Purchased OREO is defined as OREO that was acquired in bank acquisitions including those acquisitions covered by the loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC. Purchased OREO totaled $15.0 million and $9.5 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAmortization of intangible assets increased $8.2 million, or 86.2%, to $17.7 million for 2019 compared with $9.5 million for 2018 due to additional amortization of intangible assets recorded as part of the USPF, Atlantic, Hamilton and Fidelity acquisitions.\nAssets Covered by Loss-Sharing Agreements with the FDIC\n1 A reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures can be found in following table.\nGain on sale of SBA loans increased by $3.3 million, or 122.1%, to $6.1 million during 2019 compared with 2018, reflecting an 118.1% increase in SBA loans sold during 2019 compared with 2018.\n\nInterest expense on deposits and other borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $69.9 million, an increase of $35.7 million, or 104.4%, compared with $34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. During 2018 average interest-bearing liabilities were $6.34 billion as compared with $4.85 billion for 2017, an increase of $1.48 billion, or 30.6%. During 2018, average noninterest-bearing accounts amounted to $2.16 billion and comprised 27.5% of average total deposits, compared with $1.67 billion, or 28.6% of average total deposits, during 2017. Average balances of time deposits amounted to $1.67 billion and comprised 21.2% of average total deposits during 2018, compared with $1.00 billion, or 17.2% of average total deposits, during 2017.\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\u2022Organic growth in loans of $751.8 million, or 9.2%, compared with $482.6 million, or 8.5%, in 2018\n\nThe following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated. Management believes the allowance can be allocated only on an approximate basis. The allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any other category.\nWe have a large, stable base of time deposits with little or no dependence on what we consider volatile deposits. Volatile deposits, in management's opinion, are those deposit accounts that are overly rate sensitive and apt to move if our rate offerings are not at or near the top of the market. Generally speaking, these are brokered deposits or time deposits in amount greater than $100,000.\nOFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nLIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY\nThe following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and net charge-offs for legacy loans, purchased loans,\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets purchased in business combinations. Goodwill is required to be tested annually for impairment or whenever events occur that may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount is not probable. In the event of an impairment, the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value is charged to earnings. The Company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year.\nWe sell residential mortgage and SBA loans with servicing retained. We have also assumed servicing of loans sold with servicing retained, primarily indirect automobile loan pools, in prior acquisitions. When the contractual servicing fees on loans sold with servicing retained are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer for performing the servicing, a capitalized servicing asset is recognized. Servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized into non-interest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. Management makes certain estimates and assumptions related to costs to service varying types of loans and pools of loans, the projected lives of loans and pools of loans sold, and discount factors used in calculating the present values of servicing fees projected to be received.\nOther professional fees decreased $9.5 million, or 67.4%, from $14.1 million in 2017 to $4.6 million in 2018, primarily due to a $5.5 million reduction in fees incurred in the premium finance division pursuant to the USPF management and license agreement which were discontinued after completion of the USPF acquisition on January 31, 2018 coupled with a $5.2 million reduction in consulting fees related to our BSA compliance function.\n\nServicing Assets\n\n\nThe allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses is based on management's evaluation of the size and composition of the loan portfolio, the level of non-performing and past due loans, historical trends of charged-off loans and recoveries, prevailing economic conditions and other factors management deems appropriate. As these factors change, the level of loan loss provision may change.\n\nThe following table presents the amount of troubled debt restructurings, excluding purchased loans, by collateral types, classified separately as accrual and non-accrual at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nIncome from mortgage banking activities increased $5.1 million, or 10.5%, to $53.7 million during 2018 compared with 2017. Retail mortgage revenues increased $11.2 million, or 18.5%, during 2018, from $60.5 million for 2017 to $71.7 million for 2018. Net income for the Company's retail mortgage division grew 35.9% during 2018 to $16.5 million. Revenues from the Company's warehouse lending division increased $3.5 million, or 45.9%, during the year, from $7.6 million for 2017 to $11.1 million for 2018. Net income for the warehouse lending division increased $3.7 million, or 86.8%, during 2018, from $4.3 million for 2017 to $8.1 million for 2018.\nThe amount of purchased loans outstanding, at the indicated dates, is shown in the following table according to type of loan.\nCovered loans are shown below according to loan type as of the end of the years shown (in thousands).\n\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation.\n2018 compared with 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, interest income was $413.3 million, an increase of $119.0 million, or 40.4%, compared with the same period in 2017. Average earning assets increased $2.10 billion, or 31.1%, to $8.86 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with $6.76 billion as of December 31, 2017. Yield on average earning assets on a taxable equivalent basis increased during 2018 to 4.71%, compared with 4.46% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Average yields on all interest-earning asset categories increased from 2017 to 2018 with the exception of purchased loans, which experienced a decrease from 5.96% in 2017 to 5.72% in 2018.\n2019 compared with 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, interest income was $636.4 million, an increase of $223.1 million, or 54.0%, compared with the same period in 2018. Average earning assets increased $4.27 billion, or 48.2%, to $13.13 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with $8.86 billion for 2018. Yield on average earning assets on a taxable equivalent basis increased during 2019 to 4.88%, compared with 4.71% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Average yields on all interest-earning asset categories increased from 2018 to 2019 with the exception of loans held for sale, which experienced a decrease from 4.07% in 2018 to 3.75% in 2019.\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\n2019 compared with 2018. Total noninterest income in 2019 was $198.1 million, compared with $118.4 million in 2018, reflecting an increase of 67.3%, or $79.7 million.\nA simple interest rate gap\u201d analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Accordingly, the ALCO Committee also evaluates how the repayment of particular assets and liabilities is impacted by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may not react identically to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps\u201d) which limit changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase.\n(1)Yields were computed using coupon interest, adding discount accretion or subtracting premium amortization, as appropriate, on a ratable basis over the life of each security. The weighted average yield for each maturity range was computed using the amortized cost of each security in that range.\nNoninterest Income\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThe amounts of securities available for sale in each category as of December 31, 2019 are shown in the following table according to contractual maturity classifications: (i) one year or less, (ii) after one year through five years, (iii) after five years through ten years and (iv) after ten years.\nIncome Taxes\n\nAmortization periods for intangible assets are reviewed annually in connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill.\nThe amount of loans outstanding, excluding purchased loans, at the indicated dates is shown in the following table according to type of loans.\n\nNet Interest Income\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had a cash flow hedge that matures September 15, 2020 with a notional amount of $37.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, for the purpose of converting the variable rate on the junior subordinated debentures to a fixed rate of 4.11%. The interest rate swap, which is classified as a cash flow hedge, is indexed to 90-Day LIBOR.\nService charges on deposit accounts increased by $4.7 million, or 10.1%, to $50.8 million during 2019 compared with 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to the Fidelity acquisition which closed on July 1, 2019 and the full year impact of the Atlantic and Hamilton acquisitions which both closed during the second quarter of 2018. Maintenance service charges on deposits and non-sufficient funds/overdraft charges both increased during 2019 while interchange income decreased slightly due to the impact of the Durbin Amendment beginning in the third quarter of 2019.\nCapital Regulations\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated quarterly financial information of the Company. This information is derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements, which include, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods.\nThe following table summarizes short-term borrowings for the periods indicated.\nEARNING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nThe summary of changes in interest income and interest expense on a fully taxable equivalent basis resulting from changes in volume and changes in rates for each category of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are shown in the following table:\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOther noninterest expense increased $17.9 million, or 50.2%, to $53.5 million in 2019 from $35.6 million in 2018, resulting primarily from increases in loss on sale of bank premises, ATM expenses, loan servicing expense, and deposit account charge-offs, partially offset by a decrease in hurricane related expenses and debit card charge-offs. Also contributing to the increase was an increase in variable expenses related to our elevated mortgage production.\nThe following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2019, the interest rate sensitivity gap (i.e., interest rate sensitive assets minus interest rate sensitive liabilities), the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap, the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio (i.e., interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitive liabilities) and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio. The table also sets forth the time periods in which earning assets and liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms. However, the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers. In addition, various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times within such period and at different rates.\nThe required CET1 Ratio, Tier 1 Capital Ratio, and the Total Capital Ratio reflected in the table above include a capital conservation buffer of 2.50%.\nNET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE\nTotal legacy loans, excluding purchased loans, as of December 31, 2019, are shown in the following table according to their contractual maturity.\n\u2022Continued management of nonperforming assets, approximately flat at 0.56% of total assets compared with 2018\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nConsidering current information and events regarding a borrower's ability to repay its obligations, management considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectability of all amounts due, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, is in doubt. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or if the loan is collateral-dependent, the fair value of the collateral is used to determine the amount of impairment. Impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for loan losses.\nAt December 31, 2019, estimated costs to complete construction projects in progress and other binding commitments for capital expenditures were not a material amount.\n\n\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as the provision for loan losses and gains on FDIC-\nIn accordance with risk capital guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve, we are required to maintain a minimum standard of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%. Additionally, all member banks must maintain core\u201d or Tier 1\u201d capital of at least 4% of total assets ( leverage ratio\u201d). Member banks operating at or near the 4% capital level are expected to have well-diversified risks, including no undue interest rate risk exposure, excellent control systems, good earnings, high asset quality and well managed on- and off-balance sheet activities, and, in general, be considered strong banking organizations with a composite 1 rating under the CAMEL rating system of banks. For all but the most highly rated banks meeting the above conditions, the minimum leverage ratio is to be 4% plus an additional 1% to 2%.\nLong-Lived Assets, Including Intangibles\nSalaries and benefits increased $29.3 million, or 24.5%, from $119.8 million in 2017 to $149.1 million in 2018. This increase was attributable to $8.4 million in expense related to executive retirement benefits coupled with higher incentive pay, increased share-based compensation expense and increased investment in the Company's BSA function, as well as staff additions resulting from the Atlantic acquisition and the Hamilton acquisition both of which closed during the second quarter of 2018. Full time equivalent employees increased from 1,460 at December 31, 2017 to 1,804 at December 31, 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the regulatory capital levels of Ameris at December 31, 2019.\nThe Company seeks to diversify its loan portfolio across its geographic footprint and in various loan types. Also, the Company's in-house lending limit for a single loan is $40.0 million, which would normally prevent a concentration with a single loan project. Certain lending relationships may contain more than one loan and, consequently, exceed the in-house lending limit. The Company regularly monitors its largest loan relationships to avoid a concentration with a single borrower. The largest 25 loan relationships as of December 31, 2019 based on committed amount are summarized below by type.\nCAPITAL ADEQUACY\nIn the ordinary course of business, our Bank has granted commitments to extend credit to approved customers. Generally, these commitments to extend credit have been granted on a temporary basis for seasonal or inventory requirements or for construction period financing and have been approved within the Bank's credit guidelines. Our Bank has also granted commitments to approved customers for financial standby letters of credit. These commitments are recorded in the financial statements when funds are disbursed or the financial instruments become payable. The Bank uses the same credit policies for these off-balance-sheet commitments as it does for financial instruments that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitment amounts expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\n\nassisted transactions, for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe have developed a methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses which is monitored by the Company's Chief Credit Officer. Procedures provide for the assignment of a risk rating for every loan included in the total loan portfolio. Commercial insurance premium loans, overdraft protection loans and certain mortgage loans and consumer loans serviced by outside processors are treated as pools for risk rating purposes. The risk rating schedule provides nine ratings of which five ratings are classified as pass ratings and four ratings are classified as criticized ratings. Each risk rating is assigned a percent factor to be applied to the loan balance to determine the adequate amount of allowance. Relationships in excess of $2.0 million require an annual review and are generally performed by someone independent of the loan officer. Those reviews are approved by Regional Credit Officers and are often reviewed by independent third parties, such as auditors, regulators or loan review. As a result of these loan reviews, certain loans may be assigned specific allowance allocations. Other loans that surface as problem loans may also be assigned specific allowance allocations. Assigned risk ratings can be adjusted based on the number of days past due. The calculation of the allowance for loan losses, including underlying data and assumptions, is reviewed regularly by the independent internal loan review department.\nPurchased loan pools are defined as groups of residential mortgage loans that were not acquired in bank acquisitions or FDIC-assisted transactions. As of December 31, 2019, purchased loan pools totaled $213.2 million and consisted of whole-loan, adjustable rate residential mortgages on properties outside the Company's markets, with principal balances totaling $212.4 million and $811,000 of remaining purchase premium paid at acquisition. As of December 31, 2018, purchased loan pools totaled $262.6 million with principal balances totaling $260.5 million and $2.1 million of remaining purchase premium paid at acquisition. As of December 31, 2017, purchased loan pools totaled $328.2 million with principal balances totaling $324.4 million and $3.8 million of remaining purchase premium paid at acquisition. As of December 31, 2016, purchased loan pools totaled $568.3 million with principal balances totaling $559.4 million and $8.9 million of remaining purchase premium paid at acquisition. As of December 31, 2015, purchased loan pools totaled $593.0 million with principal balances totaling $580.7 million and $12.3 million of remaining purchase premium paid at acquisition. At December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015 the Company has allocated approximately $624,000, $732,000, $1.1 million, $1.8 million and $581,000, respectively, of the allowance for loan losses to the purchased loan pools.\nAs required by GAAP, we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. See Note 14, Income Taxes,\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nIntangible assets include core deposit premiums from various past bank acquisitions as well as intangible assets recorded in connection with the USPF acquisition for insurance agent relationships, the \"US Premium Finance\" trade name and a non-compete agreement.\nMerger and conversion charges of $20.5 million in 2018 reflect an increase of $19.6 million, compared with $915,000 recorded in 2017. Merger and conversion charges were elevated in 2018 due to the acquisitions of USPF, Atlantic and Hamilton during 2018, as well as the conversion of both Atlantic and Hamilton to our core system during 2018.\nAverage earning assets were approximately $13.13 billion in 2019, compared with approximately $8.86 billion in 2018. The earning asset and interest-bearing liability mix is regularly monitored to maximize the net interest margin and, therefore, increase return on assets and shareholders' equity.\nA substantial portion of our loan portfolio is in the commercial real estate and residential real estate sectors. The majority of these loans are secured by real estate in our primary market areas. A substantial portion of OREO is located in those same markets. Therefore, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of our loan portfolio and the recoverability of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of OREO are susceptible to changes to market conditions in our primary market area.\n\u2022Annualized net charge-offs of 0.10% of average total loans and 0.15% of average non-purchased loans\n2018 compared with 2017. Total noninterest expense increased $61.7 million, or 26.6%, in 2018 to $293.6 million from $231.9 million in 2017. Total noninterest expense for 2018 include approximately $20.5 million in merger-related charges, $8.4 million in executive retirement benefits expense, $983,000 in restructuring charges, $882,000 in Hurricane Michael charges, $1.0 million in losses on sale of bank premises. Total noninterest expense for 2017 includes approximately $915,000 in merger-related charges, $5.2 million in compliance-related charges, $410,000 in Hurricane Irma charges and $1.3 million in losses on sale of bank premises. Excluding these amounts, expenses in 2018 increased by $37.6 million, or 16.8%, compared with 2017 levels.\nIncluded in purchased loans above are loans that were acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions that are covered by the loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC ( covered loans\u201d) totaling $30.3 million and $38.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. OREO that is covered by the loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC totaled $36,000 and $424,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The loss-sharing agreements are subject to the servicing procedures as specified in the agreements with the FDIC. The expected reimbursements under the loss-sharing agreements were recorded as an indemnification asset at their estimated fair value at the respective acquisition dates. The net FDIC loss-share payable reported at December 31, 2019 was $19.6 million which includes the clawback liability of $20.4 million the Bank expects to pay to the FDIC. The net FDIC loss-share payable reported at December 31, 2018 was $19.5 million which includes the clawback liability of $19.5 million the Bank expects to pay to the FDIC.\n\nAssets purchased and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. The fair value of a loan portfolio acquired in a business combination requires greater levels of management estimates and judgment than the remainder of purchased assets or assumed liabilities. On the date of acquisition, when the loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. The Company must estimate expected cash flows at each reporting date. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges and adjusted accretable yield which will have a positive impact on future interest income.\nAverage amount of various deposit classes and the average rates paid thereon are presented below.\nWe must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or adjust this allowance in a period, we must include an expense within the tax provisions in the statement of income.\n\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had brokered deposits of $452.7 million. The amounts of time certificates of deposit issued in amounts of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2019, are shown below by category, which is based on time remaining until maturity of (i) three months or less, (ii) over three through twelve months and (iii) greater than one year.\nService charges on deposit accounts increased by $4.1 million, or 9.7%, to $46.1 million during 2018 compared with 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to the Atlantic and Hamilton acquisitions which both closed during the second quarter of 2018. All areas of service charges on deposits increased during 2018 including maintenance service charges on deposits, interchange income, and non-sufficient funds/overdraft charges.\nALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES\nThe investment portfolio consists of securities which are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of the related deferred tax effect.\n\nThe Company's provision for loan losses during 2019 amounted to $19.8 million, compared with $16.7 million for 2018 and $8.4 million for 2017. Net charge-offs in 2019 were 0.10% of average loans compared with 0.18% in 2018 and 0.12% in 2017. Net charge-offs in 2019 were 0.15% of average legacy loans, compared with 0.27% in 2018 and 0.13% in 2017. Of the $14.5 million in legacy loan net charge-offs recorded during 2018, approximately $7.2 million, or 49.5%, were charge-offs within the Premium Finance Division stemming from two purchased loan relationships. These two relationships were non-core general operating lines to insurance agencies and were not the traditional premium finance offerings that the Company primarily focuses on. Management notes that both agencies suffered unusual circumstances that precipitated their defaults. Excluding these unusual charge-offs, total net charge-offs for 2018 would have been 0.09% of average total loans and legacy net charge-offs in 2018 would have been 0.14% of average legacy loans. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining balance on those non-core loans totaled $6.8 million.\n2018 compared with 2017. Total noninterest income in 2018 was $118.4 million, compared with $104.5 million in 2017, reflecting an increase of 13.4%, or $14.0 million.", "item_7_tables": "Table 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>
