MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d should be read in conjunction with the Business\u201d section and our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The financial information contained herein is taken or derived from such consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise indicated. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those that are discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly under Risk Factors.\u201d\nAmounts are presented in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for per share data or as otherwise noted.\nOur Company\nWe are a multi-national cannabis company with the mission to be an industry-leading global cannabinoid company recognized for our principles, people and performance while fostering a healthier global community. We are working to develop one of the industry's leading, low-cost global business-to-business supply chains with the goal of providing high quality, pharmaceutical grade cannabis and wellness products to customers and patients at competitive prices. In addition to the cannabinoid business, we are also engaged in the non-cannabinoid business of formulating, manufacturing, marketing, selling, distributing, and otherwise commercializing homeopathic and other natural remedies, wellness products, and nutraceuticals. We continue to invest in building a distribution network with a global footprint, with operations and investments in Colombia, Portugal, Germany, the United States and Canada.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, we own over 1.9 million square feet of greenhouse cultivation capacity across two continents and approximately 13 million square feet of agricultural land, with an option to acquire approximately 73 million additional\nsquare feet of land for cultivation expansion. Our Colombian cultivation operations have one of the largest greenhouse capacities licensed for cannabis production in Latin America, and have been granted GACP certification by CUMCS. Our Colombian manufacturing facilities were granted Colombian GMP certification by INVIMA in August 2019 and EU GMP certification by HALMED in July 2020. Our post-harvest facility also received EU GMP certification in July 2020. We are the first company to legally export cannabinoids from Colombia, and we are among a small number of cannabis companies in the world to receive EU GMP certification. EU GMP certification is a required qualification to import medical cannabis products into the European market, which adheres to strict pharmaceutical quality standards. In August 2020, our operations in Portugal were provisionally licensed for the commercial cultivation, import and export of medical cannabis by INFARMED. Our Portugal facility received the GACP certificate in March 2021.\nUnlike several cannabis operators, which in many cases are confined to one geography and may rely on initial market protections afforded by the existing regulatory framework, we can scale our production in low-cost regions of the world, such as Colombia and Portugal, while maintaining access to some higher value-added end markets such as the EU because of our EU GMP certification and global network.\nOur business model is focused on partnering with leading and emerging cannabis businesses by providing them with lower cost product, variable cost structures, reliable supply throughout the year, and accelerated speed to market. This is achievable due to our production locations, capacity, product registrations and various product certifications. To date, we have had limited export shipments of our cannabis products to Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru, Poland, Spain, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nIn April 2019, we acquired Herbal Brands, which manufactures and distributes nutraceutical products to over 15,000 retail locations across the United States. Although the vast majority of our sales to date have been from our Herbal Brands subsidiary, we believe Herbal Brands provides a platform we can leverage for greater cannabinoid distribution in the future.\nWe manage our business in two segments: the Cannabinoid and Non-Cannabinoid segments.\n1.The Cannabinoid operating segment is comprised of the Company's cultivation, extraction, manufacturing, commercialization, and distribution of cannabinoid products. This operating segment is in the early stages of commercializing cannabinoid products internationally subject to applicable international and state laws and regulations. All our customers and sales for our cannabinoid segment products are presently outside of the U.S.\n2.The Non-Cannabinoid operating segment is comprised of the brands and manufacturing assets acquired as part of our acquisition of Herbal Brands. The segment is engaged in the business of formulating, manufacturing, marketing, selling, distributing, and otherwise commercializing wellness products and nutraceuticals, excluding cannabinoid products. Our principal customers for the Herbal Brands products include specialty and health retailers, mass retailers and specialty and health stores in the U.S.\nFactors Impacting our Business\nWe believe that our future success will primarily depend on the following factors:\nGlobalization of the industry. Due to our MNO model focused on geographic diversification, which distinguishes us from many of our competitors and allows us to scale our production in low-cost regions of the world, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize in markets where the medical cannabis and hemp industry offers a reasonably regulated and free flow of goods across national boundaries. While certain countries, such as Canada, have historically not welcomed imported cannabis or hemp products for commercial purposes, other countries, such as Germany and Brazil, depend primarily on imports.\nGlobal medical market expansion. We believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on expansion of global cannabis markets, as more legal medical cannabis geographies emerge. Medical cannabis is now authorized at the national or federal level in over 41 countries, and more than half of these countries have legalized or introduced significant reforms to their cannabis-use laws to broaden the scope of permitted medical uses beyond the original parameters. Over the past three years, we have established regional operations in Canada, Colombia, Portugal, and Germany, and we have invested significant resources in personnel and partnerships to build the foundation for new export channels.\nProduct development and innovation. Because of the rapid evolution of the cannabis industry, the disparate regulations across different geographies, and the time required to develop and validate pharmaceutical-grade products, the pace at which we can expand our portfolio of products and formulations will impact market acceptance for our products. To increase our output while maintaining or reducing unit costs, we may need to enhance our cultivation, extraction, and other processing methods.\nWe believe our focus on the production of proprietary and exclusive products or formulations that comply with stringent regulations, or that result in enhanced benefits for patients or consumers, could create advantages in various markets.\nRegulatory expertise and adaptation. As more markets welcome the importation of cannabis or hemp products for commercial purposes, which requires navigating and complying with the strict and evolving cannabis regulations across the different geographies, we believe that we are well positioned to expand in these markets. Clever Leaves has built a global regulatory team that is experienced in developing good relationships with regulatory agencies and governments that govern and shape the cannabis industry in their respective jurisdictions. Key expertise includes complying with and securing quotas, product approvals, export permits, import permits and other geographic specific licenses.\nStrategically expanding productive capacity and manufacturing capabilities. It is beneficial to have low operating costs and to control the production process to generate consistency and quality on a large scale. As we expand into new markets and grow our presence in existing markets, we expect significant investments in cultivation and processing will be required, which may necessitate additional capital raises. We also aim to increase productive capacity through innovation in cultivation or processing methods, improving yields and output levels of our existing assets. While we believe our core cultivation and extraction operations in Colombia are adequately sized for our current business operations, as our cannabis sales grow and expand to flower products, we plan to expand our operations and invest in advanced processing or finished good manufacturing capabilities, particularly in Colombia and Portugal.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe use the following key operating metrics to evaluate our business and operations, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, project our future performance and make strategic decisions. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate key operating metrics with similar names differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.\nThe following table presents select operational and financial information of the Cannabinoid segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 6: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 7: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operational information: </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In $000s,except kilogram and per gram\ndata)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Kilograms (dry flower) harvested(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>56,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs to produce (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(496) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs to produce per gram </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.07) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selected financial information: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/M </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Kilograms sold(c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>24,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/M </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue per grams sold </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.11) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/M: Not a meaningful percentage.\n_______________\n(a)Kilograms (dry flower) harvested - represents the weight of dried plants post-harvest both for sale and for research and development purposes. This operating metric is used to measure the productivity of our farms.\n(b)Costs to produce - includes costs associated with cultivation, extraction, depreciation, quality assurance and supply chain related to kilograms (dry flower) harvested.\n(c)Kilograms sold - represents the amount in kilograms of product sold in dry plant equivalents. Extract is converted to dry plant equivalent for purposes of this metric.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 we sold 24,035 and 644 kilograms, respectively, of dry flower equivalents. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our cannabinoid segment sales were primarily in Colombia, Australia, Israel and Brazil. The increase was primarily driven by the Company commencing its sales activity for cannabinoid products.\nWe harvested 56,685 kilograms of cannabinoids in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 39,720 kilograms in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the expansion of our cultivation facilities in Colombia.\nCosts to produce were approximately $0.14 per gram of dry flower equivalent for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $0.21 per gram of dry flower equivalent for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in costs to produce is primarily driven by the expansion of our cultivation capacity facilities in Colombia and the resulting economies of scale.\nRecent Developments\nPortugal Licensing\nThe GACP certification attests that we operate under the guidelines that ensure high quality production and products, according to WHO and European Medicine Agency Guidelines (\"EMA\"), on good agricultural and collection practices for (i) medicinal plants under WHO and (ii) starting materials of herbal origin under EMA. Our operations in Colombia were granted such certification on May 27, 2020, with an inclusion of land on November 9, 2020, which means that all greenhouses operate under GACP.\nThe same certification was granted to our operation in Portugal on February 22, 2021, for its greenhouse and postharvest facility.\nThese certificates must be yearly renewed.\nNotable 2020 Developments\nClosing of the Business Combination\nOn December 18, 2020, Clever Leaves and SAMA consummated the previously announced Business Combination contemplated by the Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement, dated as of November 9, 2020, by and among SAMA, Clever Leaves, the Company and Merger Sub.\nPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, each of the following transactions occurred in the following order: (i) pursuant to a court-approved Canadian plan of arrangement (the Plan of Arrangement\u201d and the arrangement pursuant to such Plan of Arrangement, the Arrangement\u201d), at 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on December 17, 2020 (2:59 a.m., Eastern time, on December 18, 2020) (a) all of the Clever Leaves shareholders exchanged their Class A common shares without par value of Clever Leaves ( Clever Leaves common shares\u201d) for our common shares without par value ( common shares\u201d) and/or non-voting common shares without par value ( non-voting common shares\u201d) (as determined in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement) and (b) certain Clever Leaves shareholders received approximately $3,100 in cash in the aggregate (the Cash Arrangement Consideration\u201d), such that, immediately following the Arrangement, Clever Leaves became our direct wholly-owned subsidiary; (ii) at 12:01 a.m., Pacific time (3:01 a.m. Eastern time), on December 18, 2020, Merger Sub merged with and into SAMA, with SAMA surviving such merger as our direct wholly-owned subsidiary (the Merger\u201d) and, as a result of the Merger, all of the shares of SAMA common stock were converted into the right to receive common shares as set forth in the Business Combination Agreement; (iii) immediately following the consummation of the Merger, we contributed 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SAMA (as the surviving corporation of the Merger) to Clever Leaves, such that, SAMA became a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Clever Leaves; and (iv) immediately following the contribution of SAMA to Clever Leaves, Clever Leaves contributed 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of NS US Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clever Leaves, to SAMA. Upon the closing of the Merger, SAMA changed its name to Clever Leaves US, Inc.\nOn December 18, 2020, SAMA's units, shares of SAMA common stock and warrants ceased trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq\u201d), and our common shares and warrants began trading on Nasdaq under the symbols CLVR\u201d and CLVRW,\u201d respectively. For further details, see Note 8. and Note 13. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe Company expects its operations to continue to be affected by the recent and ongoing outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease ( COVID-19\u201d), which was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. The spread of COVID-19 has severely impacted many economies around the globe. In many countries, including those where the Company operates, businesses are being forced to cease or limit operations for long or indefinite periods of time. Measures taken to contain the spread of the virus, including travel bans, quarantines, social distancing, and closures of non-essential services have triggered significant disruptions to businesses worldwide, resulting in an economic slowdown. Global stock markets have also experienced increased volatility and, in certain cases, significant declines.\nGovernments and central banks have responded with monetary and fiscal interventions to stabilize economic conditions and the Company has taken steps to obtain financial assistance made available from jurisdictional governments, however the Company expects its 2021 financial performance to continue to be impacted and result in a delay of certain of its go-to-market initiatives.\nThe duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of government and central bank responses, remains unclear. It is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of these consequences, nor their impact on the financial position and results of the Company for future periods.\nWe continue to monitor closely the impact of COVID-19, with a focus on the health and safety of our employees, and business continuity. We have implemented various measures to reduce the spread of the virus including requiring that our non-production employees work from home, restricting visitors to production locations, screening employees with infrared temperature readings and requiring them to complete health questionnaires on a daily basis before they enter facilities, implementing social distancing measures at our production locations, enhancing facility cleaning protocols, and encouraging employees to adhere to preventative measures recommended by the WHO. Our global operational sites have been reduced to business-critical personnel only and physical distancing measures are in effect. In addition, since our non-production workforce can effectively work remotely using various technology tools, we are able to maintain our full operations. Although our operational sites remain open, mandatory or voluntary self-quarantines may further limit the staffing of our facilities.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been disruptions in supply chains, including the impact on international flights and air-cargo restrictions that has limited the shipping of our products from Colombia to other countries. Since July 10, 2020, international flights from Colombia have resumed on a limited basis and with certain restrictions. In addition, there have been disruptions to our planned expansion of certain product line and production processes. The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected the completion of licensing in Portugal due to INFARMED's impaired ability to conduct physical inspections of our facilities. For more information on the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, refer to Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has caused severe disruptions in the global economy and to our business, and may have an adverse impact on our performance and results of operations.\u201d\nConvertible Note Amendments\nIn connection with the Business Combination, on November 9, 2020, Clever Leaves and the noteholders agreed to amend the terms of the 2022 Convertible Notes to, among other matters, decrease the interest rate to 8%, commencing January 1, 2021, and provide that such interest is to be paid in cash, quarterly in arrears, and also provides the Company with the option to satisfy the payment of quarterly interest by issuing common shares to the noteholders.\nFollowing the closing of the Business Combination, the 2022 Convertible Notes remained outstanding, but are convertible into our common shares in accordance with their terms. For additional detail see \" - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt - Convertible Note Amendments\" and Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nNeem Holdings Convertible Note and Neem Holdings Warrants\nOn November 9, 2020, Clever Leaves and the Company entered into an unsecured subordinated convertible note (the Neem Holdings Convertible Note\u201d) with a principal amount of $3,000 in favor of Neem Holdings, LLC ( Neem Holdings\u201d), a shareholder of Clever Leaves. Clever Leaves is required to repay the Neem Holdings Convertible Note within 10 business days after the closing of the Business Combination, and the Company has agreed to promptly satisfy this obligation in full. The Neem Holdings Convertible Note is interest free. The Neem Holdings Convertible Note was repaid on December 23, 2020.\nOn November 9, 2020, Clever Leaves issued to Neem Holdings, a shareholder of Clever Leaves, a warrant (the Neem Holdings Warrants\u201d) to purchase the number of Clever Leaves common shares (the Warrant Shares\u201d) that would entitle Neem Holdings to receive 300,000 common shares in the Arrangement for an aggregate purchase price of $3. The Neem Holdings Warrants are exercisable for all, but not less than all, of the Warrant Shares and expire at the earlier of (i) the date and time that the Business Combination Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; and (ii) the Arrangement Effective Time. The Neem Holdings Warrants were exercised prior to the Arrangement Effective Time.\nFor further details, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\n2020 Fourth Quarter Debenture Fundraising\nIn October 2020, Clever Leaves completed a financing, pursuant to which it issued $1,230 aggregate principal amount of September 2023 Convertible Debentures. In addition, on November 9, 2020, certain Subscribers in the SAMA PIPE signed subscription agreements with Clever Leaves to invest $1,500 in the aggregate in additional September 2023 Convertible Debentures as part of the Convertible Debenture Investment. All September 2023 Convertible Debentures were converted into Clever Leaves common shares and then into common shares of the Company as part of the Arrangement. For additional details see - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt - 2020 Fourth Quarter Debenture Financing.\u201d and Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nGNC Bankruptcy\nOn June 23, 2020, GNC and its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief pursuant to Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code\u201d) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In September 2020, a bankruptcy court judge approved the sale of GNC to an investor and in the third quarter of 2020, substantially all of the assets of GNC were sold to Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holding Corp. Ltd., and GNC emerged from Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. For more information on the potential impact of GNC on our business, refer to Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business - We currently depend on a limited set of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue. If we fail to retain or expand our customer relationships or if one or more significant customers were to terminate their relationship with us or reduce their purchases, or, our revenue could decline significantly\u201d, as well as Note 9. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nHerbal Brands Loan Amendment\nOn August 27, 2020, we amended certain terms of the Herbal Brands Loan to provide for an additional interest of 4% per annum, compounding quarterly and payable in-kind at maturity. In addition, we extended the expiry date of the outstanding 193,402 warrants till May 3, 2023. As part of the amendment, the parties agreed that compliance with certain financial covenants under the Herbal Brands Loan will be deferred until September 30, 2021 and will not be required following a Qualified IPO (as defined in the Herbal Brands Loan). The Business Combination meets the definition of Qualified IPO under the Herbal Brands Loan. See Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nEU GMP Certification\nOn July 8, 2020, Clever Leaves received EU GMP certification from the HALMED for its post-harvest and extraction facilities located in Colombia. EU GMP certification is expected to expand Clever Leaves' ability to serve the burgeoning European medical cannabis and hemp markets, which have rigorous quality, compliance, and regulatory requirements. Because we are among a small number of companies globally to have earned EU GMP certification, EU GMP certification is also expected to expand our early mover advantage in the pharmaceutical channel as global demand increases and more legal cannabis geographies emerge.\nSeries E Round of Fundraising\nIn April and July 2020, Clever Leaves completed the Series E round of financing (the Series E Financing\u201d) and issued an aggregate of approximately $18,396 of senior convertible Class D preferred shares (the Class D preferred shares\u201d) and $4,162 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Debentures due 2023 (the June 2023 Convertible Debentures\u201d). The Class D preferred shares and the June 2023 Convertible Debentures were converted into Clever Leaves common shares and then into common shares of the Company as part of the Arrangement. For additional details see - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt - Series E Financing\u201d and Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nPortugal Licensing\nIn August 2020, we received a license from INFARMED to cultivate, import and export dried cannabis flower produced at our Portuguese cultivation site and, similar to other licensed cannabis companies in Portugal, we are listed as of August 2020 on INFARMED's Licensing Department's registry. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions on INFARMED's ability to conduct a physical inspection of our Portuguese operation, the license was issued under a special licensing procedure and requires a confirmatory physical inspection from INFARMED. Our license provides our Portuguese operations the same rights and qualifications as licenses issued under the normal procedures, including the ability to conduct commercial operations. The physical inspection took place on August 27, 2020 and, upon successful completion of the inspection review, we expect our current license to be replaced with a license issued under the normal procedures. Under the current license granted by INFARMED, our production facility in Portugal is currently cultivating cannabis for commercial purposes. Our Portugal facility received the GACP certificate in March 2021. To maintain the GACP certificate, we must cultivate and operate under GACP guidelines.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue - in our Cannabinoid segment, revenue is primarily comprised of sales of our cannabis products, which currently include cannabidiol isolate, full spectrum and standardized extracts. In our Non-Cannabinoid segment, revenue is primarily composed of sales of our nutraceutical products to our retail customers. As we have only recently begun to carry out our cannabinoid sales operations, our main revenues are derived from our Herbal Brands business.\nCost of Sales - in our Cannabinoid segment, cost of sales is primarily composed of pre-harvest, post-harvest and shipment and fulfillment. Pre-harvest costs include labor and direct materials to grow cannabis, which includes water, electricity, nutrients, integrated pest management, growing supplies and allocated overhead. Post-harvest costs include costs associated with drying, trimming, blending, extraction, purification, quality testing and allocated overhead. Shipment and fulfillment costs include the costs of packaging, labelling, courier services and allocated overhead. Total cost of sales also includes cost of sales associated with accessories and inventory adjustments. In our Non-Cannabinoid segment, cost of sales primarily includes raw materials, labor, and attributable overhead, as well as packaging labelling and fulfillment costs.\nResults of Operations\nYear

2019. The increase was driven primarily by the additional months of sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 from the Herbal Brands business which was acquired in April 2019, as well as the sales in our Cannabinoid segment.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales decreased to $4,704 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $4,732 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The slight decrease in 2020 is primarily due to the inclusion in 2019 of additional costs related to the fair value of Herbal Brands inventory following the Herbal Brands acquisition. This was mostly offset by sales of Herbal Brands products, which included an additional four months of sales in 2020, as well as the costs of sales from our Cannabinoid segment sales.\nOperating expenses\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,828 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,151) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>2,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(606) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment </td> <td>1,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/M </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>1,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(as a percentage of revenue) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>246 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>N/M </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>N/M </td> <td> </td> <td>N/M </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/M: Not a meaningful percentage\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased to $29,828 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $34,979 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower office and administration and employee-related costs, such as salaries and benefits, following certain measures we took to reduce costs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $2,577 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $3,183 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to our cost control measures to address the impact from COVID-19. Additionally, in the prior year period, we incurred higher sales and marketing costs in connection with the exploration of potential new export markets for our cannabinoid products. The decline was partly offset by an increase in marketing and selling costs related to the Herbal Brands business in the U.S., which included an additional four months of costs in 2020 compared to 2019.\nGoodwill impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a goodwill impairment of $1,682 related to our Herbal Brands business. For more information, see Note 8. and Note 10. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $1,854 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1,480 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to capital expenditures for the expansion of our cultivation and extraction assets. Additionally, the increase is attributable to the amortization of finite-lived intangible assets acquired as part of the Herbal Brands acquisition, which included an additional four months of amortization in 2020 compared\nto 2019, as well as higher amortization expense during the second half of 2020 due to the acceleration of the period over which the useful life of the GNC intangible asset is amortized, as described under -Recent Developments - GNC Bankruptcy\u201d and Note 9. and Note 11. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nNon-operating income and expenses\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on other investments </td> <td>464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(292) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on debt extinguishment </td> <td>2,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,014) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on fair value of derivative instrument </td> <td>657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>421 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange loss </td> <td>491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,575 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,084) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(69) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expenses, net </td> <td>(284) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>534 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(818) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(153) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,201) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/M: Not a meaningful percentage\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4,455 compared to $2,684 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to increased interest expense associated with the 2022 Convertible Notes, as well as a promissory note issued in relation to the Herbal Brands acquisition. Additionally, the increase reflects higher interest rates during 2020 related to the amendment in March 2020 of the terms of the 2022 Convertible Notes. For additional details, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nLoss on investments. Loss on investment was $464 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a loss of $756 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The loss on investments was primarily related to the decline in the carrying value of our investments in Lift & Co. shares and Cansativa. For more information refer to Note 7. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nLoss on debt extinguishment. Loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2,360 and related primarily to the conversion of the Series E Debentures and the September 2023 Convertible Debentures at the closing of the Business Combination. Loss on debt extinguishment of $3,374 for year ended December 31, 2019 was due to the conversion of our Series C debt of Clever Leaves in March 2019 into Class C preferred shares that were subsequently exchanged for common shares of the Company at the closing of the Business Combination. For more information, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nLoss on fair value of derivative instrument. For the year ended December 31, 2020 we experienced a loss of $657 compared to loss of $421 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the conversion of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven by the initial recognition of a derivative instrument related to the Company's holding of Lift & Co. warrants. For additional details, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nForeign exchange loss. The impact of foreign exchange for the year ended December 31, 2020 was a loss of $491 compared to a loss of $1,575 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The foreign exchange losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were primarily driven by the currency fluctuations of the Colombian peso versus the U.S. Dollar.\nOther (income) expenses, net. Other (income) expenses, net includes costs not individually material to our consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Results by Business Segment\nOur management evaluates segment profit/loss for each of the Company's reportable segments. We define segment profit/loss as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses. Segment profit/loss also excludes the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the reportable segments' underlying operating performance.

Cannabinoid revenue increased to $2,511 for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $133 for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven primarily by the sale of cannabinoid products as we began to carry out our Cannabinoid sales operations.\nNon-Cannabinoid. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased to $9,606 from $7,701 for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily attributable to the Herbal Brands business in the U.S., which included four additional months of sales in 2020, partly offset by the slower sales in 2020 due to the impact from COVID-19.\nSegment profit/loss\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Profit/(Loss): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cannabinoid </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18,798) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,250) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Cannabinoid </td> <td>1,863 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>203 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Segment Loss (a)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,935) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,636) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,701 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) For a reconciliation of segment profit/(loss) to loss before income taxes see Note 17. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nCannabinoid - Cannabinoid segment loss decreased to $18,798 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $25,250 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to cost control measures implemented by us in 2020, as well as increased sales of cannabinoid products.

The increase is primarily attributable to cost control measures implemented during 2020, as well as the additional four months of activity in the 2020 period, partly offset by lower sales in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets forth the major components of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods presented:\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,961) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(37,052) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,665) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,901) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,834 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign currency translation on cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash beginning of period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,263 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash end of period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,198 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,065) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows from operating activities\nThe change in net cash used by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily related to a decrease in use of working capital, as well as a lower net loss, net of non-cash items.\nCash flows from investing activities\nThe decrease in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily related to the Herbal Brands acquisition, our investment in Cansativa, as well as higher capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, our capital expenditures increased by approximately $14,209, primarily due to our investment in the expansion of our operations of the cannabinoid business.\nCash flows from financing activities\nThe increase in net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to the higher proceeds from debt and equity financings in 2020 compared to 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the financing activities related primarily to the Business Combination and the Series E Financing of Clever Leaves, whereas during the year ended December 31, 2019, Clever Leaves issued Series D preferred shares, 2022 Convertible Notes and debt incurred in connection with the Herbal Brands acquisition. For more information, see Note 9. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nSources of Liquidity\nWe primarily financed our operations through the issuance of preferred shares, the sale of convertible notes and cash from operations. As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $79,107 and $12,044, respectively, which were held for working capital and general corporate purposes. This represents an overall increase of $67,063.\nIn connection with the closing of the Business Combination we received approximately $73,509 of net proceeds (refer to Note 8. to the audited consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K). We have had operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future until such time, if ever, that it can generate significant revenues from the sale of its available inventories. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses from operations due to pre-commercialization activities, marketing and manufacturing activities, and general and administrative costs to support operations.\nWe have historically been able to manage liquidity requirements through cost management and cost reduction measures, supplemented with raising additional financing. While Clever Leaves has been successful in raising financing in the past, and did so as recently as November 2020, there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. The continued spread of COVID-19 (see - Recent Developments - COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d for a discussion on COVID-19) and uncertain market conditions may further limit our ability to access capital. If we are not able to secure adequate additional funding, we may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, and suspend or curtail planned programs. Any of these actions could materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nUses of Liquidity\nOur primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service obligations and for general corporate purposes. Our ability to fund operations and make planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations depends on future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors. Our consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that we will continue to be in operation for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of operations as they come due.\nWe manage our liquidity risk by preparing budgets and cash forecasts to ensure we have sufficient funds to meet obligations. In managing working capital, we may limit the amount of our cash needs by selling inventory at wholesale rates, pursuing additional financing sources, and managing the timing of capital expenditures. While we believe we have sufficient cash to meet working capital requirements in the short term, we may need additional sources of capital and/or financing, to meet planned growth requirements and to fund construction activities at our cultivation and processing facilities.\nIn connection with the Clever Leaves audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, our management determined that there were material uncertainties which caused substantial doubt about Clever Leaves' ability to continue as a going concern, absent additional financing and cost reduction or cost management measures. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, we received approximately $73,509 of net proceeds (refer to Note 8. to the audited consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K). We believe that cash on hand is sufficient to satisfy the Company's estimated liquidity needs during the twelve months from the issuance of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. If this amount is subsequently insufficient for us to continue to operate as a going concern, we may need to raise additional cash through debt, equity or other forms of financing to fund future operations which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nDebt\nTotal net debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020 was $33,843. The balance is comprised of 2022 Convertible Notes of approximately $27,750 issued in March 2019, the debt of $8,500 issued to finance the Herbal Brands acquisition in April 2019, as well as other borrowings, net of principal repayments for the Herbal Brands Loan and debt issuance costs. For more information, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nTotal debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019 was $33,728. The 2019 balance relates to the 2022 Convertible Notes issued in March 2019, as well as the Herbal Brands Loan.\nHerbal Brands Debt\nIn April 2019, to facilitate the financing the Herbal Brands acquisition, Herbal Brands entered into the Herbal Brands Loan with, and issued warrants to, a third-party lender, Rock Cliff Capital LLC ( Lender\u201d). The Herbal Brands Loan was amended in August 2020. For further details on the Herbal Brands acquisition, see Note 8. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nThe Herbal Brands Loan is a non-revolving loan with a principal amount of $8,500 and interest of 8% per annum due and payable in arrears on the first day of each fiscal quarter, commencing July 1, 2019, and calculated based on the actual number of days elapsed. In addition, Herbal Brands is required to pay in kind interest (\"PIK\") on the outstanding principal amount of the Herbal Brands Loan from August 27, 2020 until payment in full at a rate equal to 4.0% per annum, with such PIK interest being capitalized as additional principal to increase the outstanding principal balance of the Herbal Brands Loan on the first day of each fiscal quarter. The Herbal Brands Loan is to be repaid or prepaid prior to its maturity date of May 2, 2023. On a quarterly basis, the loan requires Herbal Brands to repay 85% of positive operating cash flows. Herbal Brands can also choose to prepay a portion or the Herbal Brands Loan, subject to a fee equal to the greater of (1) zero, and (2) $2,337.5, net of interest\npayments already paid (excluding PIK interest paid and PIK interest capitalized as outstanding principal) on such prepayment date. The Herbal Brands Loan is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company, secured by Herbal Brands' assets and equity interests in Herbal Brands and is subject to certain covenants. The Herbal Brands Loan remained outstanding following the closing of the Business Combination.\nConcurrently with the execution of the Herbal Brands Loan, Clever Leaves issued warrants to the Lender to purchase 193,402 Class C preferred shares of Clever Leaves on a 1:1 basis, at a price of $8.79 per share. The warrants can be exercised in whole or in part at any time prior to the expiration date of May 3, 2021, and are not assignable, transferable, or negotiable. Following the closing of the Business Combination, the warrants issued to the Lender remained outstanding but entitle the Lender to purchase common shares of the Company rather than common shares of Clever Leaves.\nOn August 27, 2020, we amended certain terms of the Herbal Brands Loan to provide for an additional interest of 4% per annum, compounding quarterly and payable in-kind at maturity. In addition, we extended the expiry date of the outstanding 193,402 warrants until May 3, 2023. As part of the amendment, the parties agreed to defer the covenant testing under the Herbal Brands Loan until September 30, 2021.\nFollowing the closing of the Business Combination and pursuant to the terms, the holder of the Rock Cliff Warrants can purchase 63,597 of the Company's common shares at a strike price of $26.73 per share.\nFor further details, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nConvertible notes\nIn March 2019, as part of the Series D financing, Clever Leaves issued $27,750 aggregate principal amount of secured convertible notes (the 2022 Convertible Notes\u201d) with a maturity date of March 30, 2022 (the 2022 Maturity Date\u201d). The 2022 Convertible Notes initially had an interest of 8% per annum, payable quarterly in cash in arrears. The 2022 Convertible Notes are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of Clever Leaves and are secured by pledged equity interests in certain subsidiaries. In March 2020 and June 2020, Clever Leaves and the noteholders amended the terms of the 2022 Convertible Notes, to increase in the interest rate to 10% from January 1, 2020 and provided that such interest is to be paid in-kind on the 2022 Maturity Date.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, on November 9, 2020, Clever Leaves and the noteholders agreed to amend the terms of the 2022 Convertible Notes to: (i) decrease the interest rate to 8%, commencing January 1, 2021, and provide that such interest is to be paid in cash, quarterly in arrears; (ii) provide for the payment of all accrued and outstanding interest from January 1 to December 31, 2020 to be made in the form of PIK Notes; to consent to the transfer of the PIK Notes to SAMA in exchange for the PIPE Shares to be issued as part of the SAMA PIPE pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreements; (iii) at the option of Clever Leaves, satisfy the payment of quarterly interest by issuing our common shares to the noteholders, at a price per share equal to 95% of the 10-Day VWAP; (iv) at the option of Clever Leaves, prepay, in cash, any or all amounts outstanding under the 2022 Convertible Notes at any time without penalty; (v) at the option of Clever Leaves on each quarterly interest payment date, repay principal and any other amounts outstanding under the 2022 Convertible Notes up to the lesser of (a) $2,000, or (b) an amount equal to four times the average value of the daily volume of common shares traded during the 10-Day VWAP period, of the total amounts outstanding under the 2022 Convertible Notes at such time by issuing common shares to the noteholders at a price per share equal to 95% of the 10-Day VWAP; and (vi) at the option of each noteholder, in the event, following the Merger Effective Time, Clever Leaves, the Company or any of their respective affiliates proposes to issue equity securities for cash or cash equivalents (the Equity Financing\u201d) (save and except for certain exempt issuances) at any time after Clever Leaves, the Company or any of their respective affiliates completes one or more equity financings raising, in aggregate, net proceeds of $25,000 (net of reasonable fees, including reasonable accounting, advisory and legal fees, commissions and other out-of-pocket expenses and inclusive of net cash retained as a result of the Business Combination on the Merger Effective Time), convert an amount of principal and/or accrued interest owing under the 2022 Convertible Notes into subscriptions to purchase up to the noteholder's pro rata share of 25% of the total securities issued under such Equity Financing on the same terms and conditions as such Equity Financing is offered to subscribers; provided, however, that if the noteholder does not elect to participate in such Equity Financing through the conversion of amounts owing under the 2022 Convertible Notes, then Clever Leaves shall be required to repay, in cash within five (5) business days following the closing of such Equity Financing, an amount equal to the noteholder's pro rata share of 25% of the total net proceeds raised from such Equity Financing (collectively, the November 2020 Convertible Note Amendments\u201d).\nIn connection with the November 2020 Convertible Note Amendments, the Required Holders (as that term is defined in the amended and restated intercreditor and collateral agency agreement, dated as of May 10, 2019, in respect of the 2022 Convertible Notes) have agreed to waive Clever Leaves' required compliance with certain restrictive covenants set forth in the\n2022 Convertible Notes, solely for the purposes of allowing Clever Leaves, the Company and their affiliates to complete the Business Combination, and have agreed to direct GLAS Americas LLC, as collateral agent in respect of the 2022 Convertible Notes, to further provide its consent therefor.\nIn connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, the Company, 1255096 B.C. Ltd., an indirect subsidiary of the Company, and Clever Leaves US, Inc. (as the surviving corporation of the Merger) each entered into a guarantee agreement in favor of GLAS Americas LLC, as the collateral agent, in respect of the 2022 Convertible Notes and became guarantors thereunder. In addition, the terms of the amended and restated pledge agreement, dated as of May 10, 2019, made by Clever Leaves in favor of the collateral agent was further amended and restated pursuant to a second amended and restated pledge agreement such that Clever Leaves pledged all of the shares in the capital of each of 1255096 B.C. Ltd. and Clever Leaves US, Inc. (as the surviving corporation of the Merger) in favor of the collateral agent. In addition, the Company pledged all of the shares in the capital of Clever Leaves in favor of the collateral agent, 1255096 B.C. Ltd. pledged all of the shares in the capital of Northern Swan International, Inc. in favor of the collateral agent, and Clever Leaves US, Inc. pledged all of the shares in the capital of NS US Holdings, Inc. in favor of the collateral agent, each pursuant to a pledge agreement.\nFollowing the closing of the Business Combination, the 2022 Convertible Notes remained outstanding, but are convertible into our common shares in accordance with their terms. In connection with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, Clever Leaves issued 9,509 warrants to acquire Clever Leaves common shares to one of the noteholders. The warrants vest when the 2022 Convertible Note issued to the warrantholder is converted into shares and expire on March 30, 2023. The warrants will be cancelled if the 2022 Convertible Note issued to the warrantholder is repaid.\nIn October 2018, as part of the Series C financing, Clever Leaves issued $17,890 aggregate principal amount of noninterest bearing unsecured convertible debentures due 2021 (the 2021 Convertible Debentures\u201d). The 2021 Convertible Debentures had a maturity date of September 30, 2021. All of the 2021 Convertible Debentures were converted into an aggregate of 2,546,670 of Class C preferred shares in March 2019.\nSeries E Financing\nIn April and July 2020, Clever Leaves completed the Series E round of financing (the Series E Financing\u201d) and issued an aggregate of approximately $18,396 of senior convertible Class D preferred shares (the Class D preferred shares\u201d) and $4,162 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Debentures due 2023 (the June 2023 Convertible Debentures\u201d). In April 2020, an investor in the Series E Financing exercised its Put Right (as defined below) in full, and Clever Leaves paid $6,250 in exchange for the purchase and cancellation of 711,035 Class C preferred shares. As a result of the Series E Financing and the exercise of the Put Right, the funds raised in the Series E Financing were approximately $16,308.\nThe June 2023 Convertible Debentures were to mature on June 30, 2023 (the 2023 Maturity Date\u201d) and bore interest of 8% per annum, commencing June 30, 2021, payable semi-annually in arrears. At the discretion of Clever Leaves, any interest accrued and payable in respect of the June 2023 Convertible Debentures might, in lieu of being paid to the holders of the June 2023 Convertible Debentures, be added, to the principal amount outstanding under the June 2023 Convertible Debentures. The Business Combination constituted a Liquidity Event (as defined in the indenture governing the June 2023 Convertible Debentures) and resulted in the conversion of all June 2023 Convertible Debentures into Clever Leaves common shares, which were exchanged for our common shares in the Arrangement.\nClass D preferred shares voted together with the Clever Leaves common shares, and were not considered a separate class for voting purposes, except as required by law or in cases of dissolution, liquidation, windup or bankruptcy proceedings which require the consent of a majority of Class D preferred shareholders. The Class D preferred shares carried a liquidation preference (the Class D Liquidation Preference\u201d) of 1.4 times the original issue price of $11.00 for the one-year period following the original issue date, increasing by 0.02 times quarterly to a maximum of 1.75 times the original issue price, in each case subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The Class D Liquidation Preference is payable on a liquidation or merger with, reverse takeover of, or other business combination with, a public company, provided that such transaction does not provide for the conversion of Class D preferred shares into Clever Leaves common shares, or certain other deemed liquidation events (the Class D Liquidation Event\u201d). The Business Combination did not constitute a Class D Liquidation Event. The Class D preferred shares were not redeemable but were convertible at any time, at the option of the holders, into Clever Leaves common shares on a 1:1 basis, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. Automatic conversion into Clever Leaves common shares would occur at the applicable conversion price which takes into account the Class D Liquidation Preference in the event of (1) the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Class D preferred shares consenting to such conversion, (2) an initial public offering or direct listing of Clever Leaves common shares on Nasdaq, NYSE or TSX, or (3) completion of a merger with, reverse takeover of or other business combination with a public company, provided that such transaction provides for the conversion of Class D\npreferred shares into Clever Leaves common shares (otherwise such transaction will trigger the payment of the Class D Liquidation Preference).\nThe Business Combination resulted in the conversion of all Class D preferred shares into Clever Leaves common shares, which were exchanged for common shares of the Company in the Arrangement.\nAs part of the Series E Financing in April 2020, Clever Leaves granted an investor in the Series E Financing a right to cause Clever Leaves to purchase up to 711,035 of the investor's previously purchased Class C preferred shares (the Put Right\u201d) at the investor's original purchase price of $8.79 per share. On April 13, 2020, the investor exercised the Put Right in full, and Clever Leaves paid $6,250 in exchange for its purchase and cancellation of 711,035 Class C preferred shares. In addition, as part of the July 2020 portion of the Series E Financing, three investors, in aggregate, exchanged 848,363 Class C preferred shares for 646,846 Class D preferred shares.\nSubsequent to the completion of the Series E Financing, 4,429,559 Class C preferred shares, 2,319,215 Class D preferred shares and $4,162 principal amount of the June 2023 Convertible Debentures were outstanding. All Class C preferred shares, Class D preferred shares and June 2023 Convertible Debentures were converted into Clever Leaves common shares and then into common shares of the Company as part of the Arrangement.\n2020 Fourth Quarter Debenture Financing\nOn October 23, 2020, Clever Leaves completed the first tranche of a financing pursuant to which it issued $1,230 aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due September 30, 2023 (the September 2023 Convertible Debentures\u201d).\nThe September 2023 Convertible Debentures were to mature on September 30, 2023 (the September 2023 Maturity Date\u201d) and bore interest of 8% per annum, commencing September 30, 2021, payable semi-annually in arrears. At the discretion of Clever Leaves, any interest accrued and payable in respect of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures might, in lieu of being paid to the holders of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures, be added to the principal amount outstanding under the September 2023 Convertible Debentures. Provided that no Liquidity Event has occurred, on the September 2023 Maturity Date, the principal aggregate amount of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures and the accrued and unpaid interest thereon would be payable in cash. At any time prior to the September 2023 Maturity Date or a Liquidity Event, a holder of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures might elect to convert its principal amount of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures and the accrued and unpaid interest thereon into Clever Leaves common shares, at a price per share equal to $5.95 (subject to adjustment). The September 2023 Convertible Debentures, including any accrued and unpaid interest, would be automatically converted into Clever Leaves common shares at a price per Clever Leaves common share equal to 70% of the price attributable to the Clever Leaves common shares upon occurrence of a Liquidity Event, subject to adjustment in the event of the subdivision or consolidation of the outstanding Clever Leaves common shares, the issue of Clever Leaves common shares or securities convertible into Clever Leaves common shares by stock dividend or distribution, or the issue or distribution of rights, options, or warrants to all or substantially all of the holders of Clever Leaves common shares in certain circumstances.\nOn November 9, 2020, certain Subscribers in the SAMA PIPE signed subscription agreements with Clever Leaves to invest $1,500 in the aggregate in additional September 2023 Convertible Debentures.\nThe Business Combination constituted a Liquidity Event and resulted in the conversion of all September 2023 Convertible Debentures into Clever Leaves common shares, which were exchanged for common shares of the Company in the Arrangement. For additional details see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nNeem Holdings Convertible Note and Neem Holdings Warrants\nOn November 9, 2020, Clever Leaves and the Company entered into the Neem Holdings Convertible Note with a principal amount of $3,000 in favor of Neem Holdings. On the same day, Clever Leaves issued the Neem Holdings Warrants that, if exercised, would entitle Neem Holdings to receive 300,000 common shares in the Arrangement. The Neem Holdings Convertible Note was repaid on December 23, 2020. The Neem Holdings Warrants were exercised prior to the Arrangement Effective Time. For additional details see - Recent Developments - Neem Holdings Convertible Note and Neem Holdings Warrants\u201d and Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nContingencies\nIn the normal course of business, we receive inquiries or become involved in legal disputes regarding various litigation matters. In the opinion of management, as of December 31, 2020 any potential liabilities resulting from claims we have received would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented, other than the obligations discussed above.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance U.S. GAAP. A detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 3. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We have identified certain policies and estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our past or present results of operations related to (i) consolidation, (ii) inventories, (iii) investments, (iv) property, plant and equipment, (v) intangible assets, (vi) business combinations and goodwill, (vii) equity method investments, (viii) leases, (ix) revenue recognition, (x) complex financial instruments. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or they have the potential to have a material impact, on our consolidated financial statements and because they require us to make significant judgments, assumptions, or estimates. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions made were reasonable, based on information available at the time they were made. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nShare-based compensation\nWe estimate the fair value of equity classified stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options are outlined in Note 15. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nAs Clever Leaves shares were not publicly traded at the time of grant, it engaged independent third-party valuation specialists to assist with determining the estimated fair value of Clever Leaves' common shares at each grant date under a multi-stage process, which involved calculating the enterprise and equity value of Clever Leaves. The enterprise value was initially calculated using the discounted cash flows method under the income approach and the prior sales of company stock method under the market approach, weighted based on Clever Leaves' current stage of development, its financial projections and the timing of the prior sales of a company's securities.\nThe discounted cash flows method under the income approach adds the present value of projected cash flows generated by operations of the company and the present value of the residual or terminal value of the company. The present values of the cash flows and the terminal value are calculated using discount rates that reflect the time value of money and the risk of the company and the projected cash flows. The greater the perceived risk associated with the forecasted cash flows, the higher the discount rate applied to them, and the lower their present value. The prior sales of company stock method under the market approach uses prices of actual transactions in a company's own securities to infer the value of the security being valued. There may be adjustments needed to deal with differences in the securities (e.g. preferred share instead of common share), standard value (e.g. control vs. non-control or marketable vs. non-marketable), and the passage of time.\nThe enterprise value was then adjusted for the Clever Leaves' cash and debt as of the valuation date and the resulting equity value was allocated using the option pricing method. The value per common share was then reduced by a discount for lack of marketability to put it on a minority, non-marketable basis.\nThe Black-Scholes implementation of the option pricing method treats the rights of holders of various classes of securities (preferred shares, common shares, warrants, and options) as call options on any value of Clever Leaves above a series of break points. The values of the break points were calculated by reviewing:\n\u2022The liquidation preferences of preferred shares (including seniority of any series of preferred shares);\n\u2022The participation rights of preferred shares (including any caps on such participation); and\n\u2022The strike prices of warrants and options.\nA Black-Scholes model requires a series of variables, including the:\n\u2022Value of company equity;\n\u2022Volatility;\n\u2022Time to liquidity event; and\n\u2022Risk-free rate.\nUncertain economic conditions, fiscal policy and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the capital markets, which would affect the discount rate assumptions, terminal value estimates, and transaction premiums. Such uncertain economic conditions could also have an adverse effect on the fundamentals of our business and results of operations, which would affect our internal forecasts about future performance and terminal value estimates. Furthermore, such uncertain economic conditions could have a negative impact on the industry in general. In addition, the risk factors that we have identified in this Form 10-K and will identify from time to time in our reports could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance, terminal value estimates and transaction premiums. There can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for the purpose of estimating grant date fair value of stock options will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.\nIn March 2020, Clever Leaves closed a round of class D Convertible Preferred Shares (Class D). Clever Leaves sold 1,308,740 shares of Class D to several investors, for a total of $14,400. While prior sales of a company's securities can be considered in establishing the current value of a company, the circumstances surrounding such a sale must be considered. In this case, these circumstances included:\n\u2022The transaction involved other considerations, specifically a financing for Clever Leaves;\n\u2022The transaction involved new investors in Clever Leaves; and\n\u2022The transaction occurred just prior to the valuation date.\nThe Class D transaction did not involve common shares, but instead involved preferred shares. In addition, in light of the substantial economic and legal advantages for Class D shareholders, common shares of Clever Leaves were viewed to be worth less than shares of Class D. The Class D shares have liquidation preferences, the power to block financings or sales, and the ability to withhold approval of any new series or shares of capital stock that have any rights that are senior or pari passu to Class D. Common shares do not have these advantages and the value of Class D does not reflect the value of the Clever Leaves' common share.\nHowever, subject to the valuation date, the economic differences between common shares and Class D shares noted above may be accounted for in the calculation of the indicated equity value. The Class D transaction was considered an arm's-length transaction and that the price derived from this transaction can be relied upon in calculating the fair value of Clever Leaves' common share at a valuation date close to the occurrence of the transaction. However, the transaction involving another class of stock (Class D) occurred more than six months prior to the valuation date, and was determined to have included other considerations involved in the investment decision (such as financing reasons, etc.), all of which suggest that the price derived from this transaction cannot be relied upon in determining the fair value of common shares as of the valuation date. As such, the discounted cash flows method under the income approach is used in calculating the fair value of Clever Leaves' common shares.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur consolidated financial statements are expressed in US dollars, but we have cash, accounts payable and financial instruments denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, including the Canadian dollar, Colombian peso and Euro as our core cultivation, harvest, and distribution operations are conducted in subsidiary locations. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Revenue and expenses of all foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rates that approximate the rates in effect at the dates when such items are recognized. Appreciating foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will adversely impact operating income and net earnings, while depreciating foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will have a positive impact.\nA 10% change in the exchange rates for the foreign currencies would affect the carrying value of net assets by approximately $230 as of December 31, 2020, with a corresponding impact to foreign exchange loss. We have not historically engaged in hedging transactions and do not currently contemplate engaging in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks. As we continue to recognize gains and losses in foreign currency transactions, depending upon changes in future currency rates, such gains or losses could have a significant, and potentially adverse, effect on our results of operations.\nLiquidity Risk\nClever Leaves monitors its cash balances and cash flows generated from operations to ensure there is sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as they come due. Liquidity management is comprised of regular analysis, monitoring, and review of forecasted and actual cash flows, and managing operational and capital funding requirements on a planned and projected basis. As of December 31, 2020, Clever Leaves' financial liabilities mainly comprise accounts payables, short-term liability, and other current liabilities which would be paid within 12 months, as well as the 2022 Convertible Notes, the Herbal Brands Loan and other loans and borrowings. For more information on our liquidity requirements see - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d above.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the value or yield of fixed-income investments may decline if interest rates change. Fluctuations in interest rates may impact the level of income and expense recorded on our cash equivalents, 2022 Convertible Notes, Herbal Brands Loan, other loans and borrowings and the market value of all interest-earning assets, other than those which possess a short term to maturity. A 1% change in the interest rate in effect on December 31, 2020 would not have a material effect on (i) fair value of our cash equivalents as the majority of the portfolio have a maturity date of three-months or less, or (ii) interest income as interest income is not a significant component of Clever Leaves' earnings and cash flow. In addition, the 2022 Convertible Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 8% and are not publicly traded. Therefore, fair value of the 2022 Convertible Notes and interest expense is not materially affected by changes in the market interest rates. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, for hedging or speculative purposes.\nCommodity Price Risk\nClever Leaves' costs are directly impacted by fluctuations in the price of commodities, particularly in the raw materials used in the production of cannabis. To manage this exposure, Clever Leaves uses purchase commitments for some of the key commodity needs in the normal course of its business and manages selling prices to its customers to offset the effects of significant commodity price changes.", "item_7_truncated": "On November 9, 2020, certain Subscribers in the SAMA PIPE signed subscription agreements with Clever Leaves to invest $1,500 in the aggregate in additional September 2023 Convertible Debentures.\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,961) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(37,052) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,665) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,901) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,834 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign currency translation on cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash beginning of period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,263 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash end of period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,198 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,065) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, each of the following transactions occurred in the following order: (i) pursuant to a court-approved Canadian plan of arrangement (the Plan of Arrangement\u201d and the arrangement pursuant to such Plan of Arrangement, the Arrangement\u201d), at 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on December 17, 2020 (2:59 a.m., Eastern time, on December 18, 2020) (a) all of the Clever Leaves shareholders exchanged their Class A common shares without par value of Clever Leaves ( Clever Leaves common shares\u201d) for our common shares without par value ( common shares\u201d) and/or non-voting common shares without par value ( non-voting common shares\u201d) (as determined in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement) and (b) certain Clever Leaves shareholders received approximately $3,100 in cash in the aggregate (the Cash Arrangement Consideration\u201d), such that, immediately following the Arrangement, Clever Leaves became our direct wholly-owned subsidiary; (ii) at 12:01 a.m., Pacific time (3:01 a.m. Eastern time), on December 18, 2020, Merger Sub merged with and into SAMA, with SAMA surviving such merger as our direct wholly-owned subsidiary (the Merger\u201d) and, as a result of the Merger, all of the shares of SAMA common stock were converted into the right to receive common shares as set forth in the Business Combination Agreement; (iii) immediately following the consummation of the Merger, we contributed 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SAMA (as the surviving corporation of the Merger) to Clever Leaves, such that, SAMA became a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Clever Leaves; and (iv) immediately following the contribution of SAMA to Clever Leaves, Clever Leaves contributed 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of NS US Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clever Leaves, to SAMA.

While Clever Leaves has been successful in raising financing in the past, and did so as recently as November 2020, there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. The continued spread of COVID-19 (see - Recent Developments - COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d for a discussion on COVID-19) and uncertain market conditions may further limit our ability to access capital. If we are not able to secure adequate additional funding, we may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, and suspend or curtail planned programs.

price of commodities, particularly in the raw materials used in the production of cannabis. To manage this exposure, Clever Leaves uses purchase commitments for some of the key commodity needs in the normal course of its business and manages selling prices to its customers to offset the effects of significant commodity price changes.\n\nAmounts are presented in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for per share data or as otherwise noted.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nThe Business Combination constituted a Liquidity Event and resulted in the conversion of all September 2023 Convertible Debentures into Clever Leaves common shares, which were exchanged for common shares of the Company in the Arrangement. For additional details see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nSeries E Financing\nAs part of the Series E Financing in April 2020, Clever Leaves granted an investor in the Series E Financing a right to cause Clever Leaves to purchase up to 711,035 of the investor's previously purchased Class C preferred shares (the Put Right\u201d) at the investor's original purchase price of $8.79 per share. On April 13, 2020, the investor exercised the Put Right in full, and Clever Leaves paid $6,250 in exchange for its purchase and cancellation of 711,035 Class C preferred shares. In addition, as part of the July 2020 portion of the Series E Financing, three investors, in aggregate, exchanged 848,363 Class C preferred shares for 646,846 Class D preferred shares.\nOn November 9, 2020, Clever Leaves and the Company entered into the Neem Holdings Convertible Note with a principal amount of $3,000 in favor of Neem Holdings. On the same day, Clever Leaves issued the Neem Holdings Warrants that, if exercised, would entitle Neem Holdings to receive 300,000 common shares in the Arrangement. The Neem Holdings Convertible Note was repaid on December 23, 2020. The Neem Holdings Warrants were exercised prior to the Arrangement Effective Time. For additional details see - Recent Developments - Neem Holdings Convertible Note and Neem Holdings Warrants\u201d and Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nNotable 2020 Developments\nFollowing the closing of the Business Combination, the 2022 Convertible Notes remained outstanding, but are convertible into our common shares in accordance with their terms. In connection with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, Clever Leaves issued 9,509 warrants to acquire Clever Leaves common shares to one of the noteholders. The warrants vest when the 2022 Convertible Note issued to the warrantholder is converted into shares and expire on March 30, 2023. The warrants will be cancelled if the 2022 Convertible Note issued to the warrantholder is repaid.\nClosing of the Business Combination\nThe Company expects its operations to continue to be affected by the recent and ongoing outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease ( COVID-19\u201d), which was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. The spread of COVID-19 has severely impacted many economies around the globe. In many countries, including those where the Company operates, businesses are being forced to cease or limit operations for long or indefinite periods of time. Measures taken to contain the spread of the virus, including travel bans, quarantines, social distancing, and closures of non-essential services have triggered significant disruptions to businesses worldwide, resulting in an economic slowdown. Global stock markets have also experienced increased volatility and, in certain cases, significant declines.\nCash flows from investing activities\nTotal debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019 was $33,728. The 2019 balance relates to the 2022 Convertible Notes issued in March 2019, as well as the Herbal Brands Loan.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, on November 9, 2020, Clever Leaves and the noteholders agreed to amend the terms of the 2022 Convertible Notes to: (i) decrease the interest rate to 8%, commencing January 1, 2021, and provide that such interest is to be paid in cash, quarterly in arrears; (ii) provide for the payment of all accrued and outstanding interest from January 1 to December 31, 2020 to be made in the form of PIK Notes; to consent to the transfer of the PIK Notes to SAMA in exchange for the PIPE Shares to be issued as part of the SAMA PIPE pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreements; (iii) at the option of Clever Leaves, satisfy the payment of quarterly interest by issuing our common shares to the noteholders, at a price per share equal to 95% of the 10-Day VWAP; (iv) at the option of Clever Leaves, prepay, in cash, any or all amounts outstanding under the 2022 Convertible Notes at any time without penalty; (v) at the option of Clever Leaves on each quarterly interest payment date, repay principal and any other amounts outstanding under the 2022 Convertible Notes up to the lesser of (a) $2,000, or (b) an amount equal to four times the average value of the daily volume of common shares traded during the 10-Day VWAP period, of the total amounts outstanding under the 2022 Convertible Notes at such time by issuing common shares to the noteholders at a price per share equal to 95% of the 10-Day VWAP; and (vi) at the option of each noteholder, in the event, following the Merger Effective Time, Clever Leaves, the Company or any of their respective affiliates proposes to issue equity securities for cash or cash equivalents (the Equity Financing\u201d) (save and except for certain exempt issuances) at any time after Clever Leaves, the Company or any of their respective affiliates completes one or more equity financings raising, in aggregate, net proceeds of $25,000 (net of reasonable fees, including reasonable accounting, advisory and legal fees, commissions and other out-of-pocket expenses and inclusive of net cash retained as a result of the Business Combination on the Merger Effective Time), convert an amount of principal and/or accrued interest owing under the 2022 Convertible Notes into subscriptions to purchase up to the noteholder's pro rata share of 25% of the total securities issued under such Equity Financing on the same terms and conditions as such Equity Financing is offered to subscribers; provided, however, that if the noteholder does not elect to participate in such Equity Financing through the conversion of amounts owing under the 2022 Convertible Notes, then Clever Leaves shall be required to repay, in cash within five (5) business days following the closing of such Equity Financing, an amount equal to the noteholder's pro rata share of 25% of the total net proceeds raised from such Equity Financing (collectively, the November 2020 Convertible Note Amendments\u201d).\nSeries E Round of Fundraising\nAs Clever Leaves shares were not publicly traded at the time of grant, it engaged independent third-party valuation specialists to assist with determining the estimated fair value of Clever Leaves' common shares at each grant date under a multi-stage process, which involved calculating the enterprise and equity value of Clever Leaves. The enterprise value was initially calculated using the discounted cash flows method under the income approach and the prior sales of company stock method under the market approach, weighted based on Clever Leaves' current stage of development, its financial projections and the timing of the prior sales of a company's securities.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 we sold 24,035 and 644 kilograms, respectively, of dry flower equivalents. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our cannabinoid segment sales were primarily in Colombia, Australia, Israel and Brazil. The increase was primarily driven by the Company commencing its sales activity for cannabinoid products.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $1,854 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1,480 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to capital expenditures for the expansion of our cultivation and extraction assets. Additionally, the increase is attributable to the amortization of finite-lived intangible assets acquired as part of the Herbal Brands acquisition, which included an additional four months of amortization in 2020 compared\nFor further details, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nIn connection with the November 2020 Convertible Note Amendments, the Required Holders (as that term is defined in the amended and restated intercreditor and collateral agency agreement, dated as of May 10, 2019, in respect of the 2022 Convertible Notes) have agreed to waive Clever Leaves' required compliance with certain restrictive covenants set forth in the\nResults of Operations\nNon-operating income and expenses\n\nThe increase in net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to the higher proceeds from debt and equity financings in 2020 compared to 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the financing activities related primarily to the Business Combination and the Series E Financing of Clever Leaves, whereas during the year ended December 31, 2019, Clever Leaves issued Series D preferred shares, 2022 Convertible Notes and debt incurred in connection with the Herbal Brands acquisition. For more information, see Note 9. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nThe Herbal Brands Loan is a non-revolving loan with a principal amount of $8,500 and interest of 8% per annum due and payable in arrears on the first day of each fiscal quarter, commencing July 1, 2019, and calculated based on the actual number of days elapsed. In addition, Herbal Brands is required to pay in kind interest (\"PIK\") on the outstanding principal amount of the Herbal Brands Loan from August 27, 2020 until payment in full at a rate equal to 4.0% per annum, with such PIK interest being capitalized as additional principal to increase the outstanding principal balance of the Herbal Brands Loan on the first day of each fiscal quarter. The Herbal Brands Loan is to be repaid or prepaid prior to its maturity date of May 2, 2023. On a quarterly basis, the loan requires Herbal Brands to repay 85% of positive operating cash flows. Herbal Brands can also choose to prepay a portion or the Herbal Brands Loan, subject to a fee equal to the greater of (1) zero, and (2) $2,337.5, net of interest\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nOn December 18, 2020, Clever Leaves and SAMA consummated the previously announced Business Combination contemplated by the Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement, dated as of November 9, 2020, by and among SAMA, Clever Leaves, the Company and Merger Sub.\nHowever, subject to the valuation date, the economic differences between common shares and Class D shares noted above may be accounted for in the calculation of the indicated equity value. The Class D transaction was considered an arm's-length transaction and that the price derived from this transaction can be relied upon in calculating the fair value of Clever Leaves' common share at a valuation date close to the occurrence of the transaction. However, the transaction involving another class of stock (Class D) occurred more than six months prior to the valuation date, and was determined to have included other considerations involved in the investment decision (such as financing reasons, etc.), all of which suggest that the price derived from this transaction cannot be relied upon in determining the fair value of common shares as of the valuation date. As such, the discounted cash flows method under the income approach is used in calculating the fair value of Clever Leaves' common shares.\n\n\u2022The liquidation preferences of preferred shares (including seniority of any series of preferred shares);\nUses of Liquidity\nRecent Developments\nProduct development and innovation. Because of the rapid evolution of the cannabis industry, the disparate regulations across different geographies, and the time required to develop and validate pharmaceutical-grade products, the pace at which we can expand our portfolio of products and formulations will impact market acceptance for our products. To increase our output while maintaining or reducing unit costs, we may need to enhance our cultivation, extraction, and other processing methods.\nThe duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of government and central bank responses, remains unclear. It is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of these consequences, nor their impact on the financial position and results of the Company for future periods.\nUnlike several cannabis operators, which in many cases are confined to one geography and may rely on initial market protections afforded by the existing regulatory framework, we can scale our production in low-cost regions of the world, such as Colombia and Portugal, while maintaining access to some higher value-added end markets such as the EU because of our EU GMP certification and global network.\nWe manage our liquidity risk by preparing budgets and cash forecasts to ensure we have sufficient funds to meet obligations. In managing working capital, we may limit the amount of our cash needs by selling inventory at wholesale rates, pursuing additional financing sources, and managing the timing of capital expenditures. While we believe we have sufficient cash to meet working capital requirements in the short term, we may need additional sources of capital and/or financing, to meet planned growth requirements and to fund construction activities at our cultivation and processing facilities.\nStrategically expanding productive capacity and manufacturing capabilities. It is beneficial to have low operating costs and to control the production process to generate consistency and quality on a large scale. As we expand into new markets and grow our presence in existing markets, we expect significant investments in cultivation and processing will be required, which may necessitate additional capital raises. We also aim to increase productive capacity through innovation in cultivation or processing methods, improving yields and output levels of our existing assets. While we believe our core cultivation and extraction operations in Colombia are adequately sized for our current business operations, as our cannabis sales grow and expand to flower products, we plan to expand our operations and invest in advanced processing or finished good manufacturing capabilities, particularly in Colombia and Portugal.\nOn November 9, 2020, Clever Leaves and the Company entered into an unsecured subordinated convertible note (the Neem Holdings Convertible Note\u201d) with a principal amount of $3,000 in favor of Neem Holdings, LLC ( Neem Holdings\u201d), a shareholder of Clever Leaves. Clever Leaves is required to repay the Neem Holdings Convertible Note within 10 business days after the closing of the Business Combination, and the Company has agreed to promptly satisfy this obligation in full. The Neem Holdings Convertible Note is interest free. The Neem Holdings Convertible Note was repaid on December 23, 2020.\nto 2019, as well as higher amortization expense during the second half of 2020 due to the acceleration of the period over which the useful life of the GNC intangible asset is amortized, as described under -Recent Developments - GNC Bankruptcy\u201d and Note 9. and Note 11. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, on November 9, 2020, Clever Leaves and the noteholders agreed to amend the terms of the 2022 Convertible Notes to, among other matters, decrease the interest rate to 8%, commencing January 1, 2021, and provide that such interest is to be paid in cash, quarterly in arrears, and also provides the Company with the option to satisfy the payment of quarterly interest by issuing common shares to the noteholders.\nOn October 23, 2020, Clever Leaves completed the first tranche of a financing pursuant to which it issued $1,230 aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due September 30, 2023 (the September 2023 Convertible Debentures\u201d).\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d should be read in conjunction with the Business\u201d section and our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The financial information contained herein is taken or derived from such consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise indicated. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those that are discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly under Risk Factors.\u201d\nSegment profit/loss\nForeign exchange loss. The impact of foreign exchange for the year ended December 31, 2020 was a loss of $491 compared to a loss of $1,575 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The foreign exchange losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were primarily driven by the currency fluctuations of the Colombian peso versus the U.S. Dollar.\nThe same certification was granted to our operation in Portugal on February 22, 2021, for its greenhouse and postharvest facility.\nEU GMP Certification\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe estimate the fair value of equity classified stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options are outlined in Note 15. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nOn December 18, 2020, SAMA's units, shares of SAMA common stock and warrants ceased trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq\u201d), and our common shares and warrants began trading on Nasdaq under the symbols CLVR\u201d and CLVRW,\u201d respectively. For further details, see Note 8. and Note 13. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nsquare feet of land for cultivation expansion. Our Colombian cultivation operations have one of the largest greenhouse capacities licensed for cannabis production in Latin America, and have been granted GACP certification by CUMCS. Our Colombian manufacturing facilities were granted Colombian GMP certification by INVIMA in August 2019 and EU GMP certification by HALMED in July 2020. Our post-harvest facility also received EU GMP certification in July 2020. We are the first company to legally export cannabinoids from Colombia, and we are among a small number of cannabis companies in the world to receive EU GMP certification. EU GMP certification is a required qualification to import medical cannabis products into the European market, which adheres to strict pharmaceutical quality standards. In August 2020, our operations in Portugal were provisionally licensed for the commercial cultivation, import and export of medical cannabis by INFARMED. Our Portugal facility received the GACP certificate in March 2021.\nFollowing the closing of the Business Combination, the 2022 Convertible Notes remained outstanding, but are convertible into our common shares in accordance with their terms. For additional detail see \" - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt - Convertible Note Amendments\" and Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\n\u2022The transaction occurred just prior to the valuation date.\n(a) For a reconciliation of segment profit/(loss) to loss before income taxes see Note 17. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nRegulatory expertise and adaptation. As more markets welcome the importation of cannabis or hemp products for commercial purposes, which requires navigating and complying with the strict and evolving cannabis regulations across the different geographies, we believe that we are well positioned to expand in these markets. Clever Leaves has built a global regulatory team that is experienced in developing good relationships with regulatory agencies and governments that govern and shape the cannabis industry in their respective jurisdictions. Key expertise includes complying with and securing quotas, product approvals, export permits, import permits and other geographic specific licenses.\nN/M: Not a meaningful percentage\n_______________\nWe are a multi-national cannabis company with the mission to be an industry-leading global cannabinoid company recognized for our principles, people and performance while fostering a healthier global community. We are working to develop one of the industry's leading, low-cost global business-to-business supply chains with the goal of providing high quality, pharmaceutical grade cannabis and wellness products to customers and patients at competitive prices. In addition to the cannabinoid business, we are also engaged in the non-cannabinoid business of formulating, manufacturing, marketing, selling, distributing, and otherwise commercializing homeopathic and other natural remedies, wellness products, and nutraceuticals. We continue to invest in building a distribution network with a global footprint, with operations and investments in Colombia, Portugal, Germany, the United States and Canada.\nNon-Cannabinoid - Non-Cannabinoid segment profit increased to $1,863 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $614 the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to cost control measures implemented during 2020, as well as the additional four months of activity in the 2020 period, partly offset by lower sales in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nThe Class D transaction did not involve common shares, but instead involved preferred shares. In addition, in light of the substantial economic and legal advantages for Class D shareholders, common shares of Clever Leaves were viewed to be worth less than shares of Class D. The Class D shares have liquidation preferences, the power to block financings or sales, and the ability to withhold approval of any new series or shares of capital stock that have any rights that are senior or pari passu to Class D. Common shares do not have these advantages and the value of Class D does not reflect the value of the Clever Leaves' common share.\nGlobalization of the industry. Due to our MNO model focused on geographic diversification, which distinguishes us from many of our competitors and allows us to scale our production in low-cost regions of the world, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize in markets where the medical cannabis and hemp industry offers a reasonably regulated and free flow of goods across national boundaries. While certain countries, such as Canada, have historically not welcomed imported cannabis or hemp products for commercial purposes, other countries, such as Germany and Brazil, depend primarily on imports.\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe enterprise value was then adjusted for the Clever Leaves' cash and debt as of the valuation date and the resulting equity value was allocated using the option pricing method. The value per common share was then reduced by a discount for lack of marketability to put it on a minority, non-marketable basis.\nConvertible notes\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased to $29,828 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $34,979 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower office and administration and employee-related costs, such as salaries and benefits, following certain measures we took to reduce costs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nClever Leaves monitors its cash balances and cash flows generated from operations to ensure there is sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as they come due. Liquidity management is comprised of regular analysis, monitoring, and review of forecasted and actual cash flows, and managing operational and capital funding requirements on a planned and projected basis. As of December 31, 2020, Clever Leaves' financial liabilities mainly comprise accounts payables, short-term liability, and other current liabilities which would be paid within 12 months, as well as the 2022 Convertible Notes, the Herbal Brands Loan and other loans and borrowings. For more information on our liquidity requirements see - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d above.\nThe decrease in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily related to the Herbal Brands acquisition, our investment in Cansativa, as well as higher capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe primarily financed our operations through the issuance of preferred shares, the sale of convertible notes and cash from operations. As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $79,107 and $12,044, respectively, which were held for working capital and general corporate purposes. This represents an overall increase of $67,063.\nFor further details, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4,455 compared to $2,684 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to increased interest expense associated with the 2022 Convertible Notes, as well as a promissory note issued in relation to the Herbal Brands acquisition. Additionally, the increase reflects higher interest rates during 2020 related to the amendment in March 2020 of the terms of the 2022 Convertible Notes. For additional details, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\n\u2022The participation rights of preferred shares (including any caps on such participation); and\nCost of sales\nThe following table sets forth the major components of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods presented:\nIn March 2020, Clever Leaves closed a round of class D Convertible Preferred Shares (Class D). Clever Leaves sold 1,308,740 shares of Class D to several investors, for a total of $14,400. While prior sales of a company's securities can be considered in establishing the current value of a company, the circumstances surrounding such a sale must be considered. In this case, these circumstances included:\n2020 Fourth Quarter Debenture Financing\nFollowing the closing of the Business Combination and pursuant to the terms, the holder of the Rock Cliff Warrants can purchase 63,597 of the Company's common shares at a strike price of $26.73 per share.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance U.S. GAAP. A detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 3. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We have identified certain policies and estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our past or present results of operations related to (i) consolidation, (ii) inventories, (iii) investments, (iv) property, plant and equipment, (v) intangible assets, (vi) business combinations and goodwill, (vii) equity method investments, (viii) leases, (ix) revenue recognition, (x) complex financial instruments. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or they have the potential to have a material impact, on our consolidated financial statements and because they require us to make significant judgments, assumptions, or estimates. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions made were reasonable, based on information available at the time they were made. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nSubsequent to the completion of the Series E Financing, 4,429,559 Class C preferred shares, 2,319,215 Class D preferred shares and $4,162 principal amount of the June 2023 Convertible Debentures were outstanding. All Class C preferred shares, Class D preferred shares and June 2023 Convertible Debentures were converted into Clever Leaves common shares and then into common shares of the Company as part of the Arrangement.\nLoss on fair value of derivative instrument. For the year ended December 31, 2020 we experienced a loss of $657 compared to loss of $421 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the conversion of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven by the initial recognition of a derivative instrument related to the Company's holding of Lift & Co. warrants. For additional details, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nOur primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service obligations and for general corporate purposes. Our ability to fund operations and make planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations depends on future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors. Our consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that we will continue to be in operation for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of operations as they come due.\nPortugal Licensing\nDebt\nThe Black-Scholes implementation of the option pricing method treats the rights of holders of various classes of securities (preferred shares, common shares, warrants, and options) as call options on any value of Clever Leaves above a series of break points. The values of the break points were calculated by reviewing:\nFactors Impacting our Business\nOther (income) expenses, net. Other (income) expenses, net includes costs not individually material to our consolidated financial statements.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $2,577 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $3,183 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to our cost control measures to address the impact from COVID-19. Additionally, in the prior year period, we incurred higher sales and marketing costs in connection with the exploration of potential new export markets for our cannabinoid products. The decline was partly offset by an increase in marketing and selling costs related to the Herbal Brands business in the U.S., which included an additional four months of costs in 2020 compared to 2019.\nTotal net debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020 was $33,843. The balance is comprised of 2022 Convertible Notes of approximately $27,750 issued in March 2019, the debt of $8,500 issued to finance the Herbal Brands acquisition in April 2019, as well as other borrowings, net of principal repayments for the Herbal Brands Loan and debt issuance costs. For more information, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nIn connection with the closing of the Business Combination we received approximately $73,509 of net proceeds (refer to Note 8. to the audited consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K). We have had operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future until such time, if ever, that it can generate significant revenues from the sale of its available inventories. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses from operations due to pre-commercialization activities, marketing and manufacturing activities, and general and administrative costs to support operations.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, we own over 1.9 million square feet of greenhouse cultivation capacity across two continents and approximately 13 million square feet of agricultural land, with an option to acquire approximately 73 million additional\nIn connection with the Clever Leaves audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, our management determined that there were material uncertainties which caused substantial doubt about Clever Leaves' ability to continue as a going concern, absent additional financing and cost reduction or cost management measures. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, we received approximately $73,509 of net proceeds (refer to Note 8. to the audited consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K). We believe that cash on hand is sufficient to satisfy the Company's estimated liquidity needs during the twelve months from the issuance of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. If this amount is subsequently insufficient for us to continue to operate as a going concern, we may need to raise additional cash through debt, equity or other forms of financing to fund future operations which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n(a)Kilograms (dry flower) harvested - represents the weight of dried plants post-harvest both for sale and for research and development purposes. This operating metric is used to measure the productivity of our farms.\nNeem Holdings Convertible Note and Neem Holdings Warrants\nThe following table provides our revenues by channel for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nOn July 8, 2020, Clever Leaves received EU GMP certification from the HALMED for its post-harvest and extraction facilities located in Colombia. EU GMP certification is expected to expand Clever Leaves' ability to serve the burgeoning European medical cannabis and hemp markets, which have rigorous quality, compliance, and regulatory requirements. Because we are among a small number of companies globally to have earned EU GMP certification, EU GMP certification is also expected to expand our early mover advantage in the pharmaceutical channel as global demand increases and more legal cannabis geographies emerge.\nPortugal Licensing\nNeem Holdings Convertible Note and Neem Holdings Warrants\nThe discounted cash flows method under the income approach adds the present value of projected cash flows generated by operations of the company and the present value of the residual or terminal value of the company. The present values of the cash flows and the terminal value are calculated using discount rates that reflect the time value of money and the risk of the company and the projected cash flows. The greater the perceived risk associated with the forecasted cash flows, the higher the discount rate applied to them, and the lower their present value. The prior sales of company stock method under the market approach uses prices of actual transactions in a company's own securities to infer the value of the security being valued. There may be adjustments needed to deal with differences in the securities (e.g. preferred share instead of common share), standard value (e.g. control vs. non-control or marketable vs. non-marketable), and the passage of time.\nA 10% change in the exchange rates for the foreign currencies would affect the carrying value of net assets by approximately $230 as of December 31, 2020, with a corresponding impact to foreign exchange loss. We have not historically engaged in hedging transactions and do not currently contemplate engaging in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks. As we continue to recognize gains and losses in foreign currency transactions, depending upon changes in future currency rates, such gains or losses could have a significant, and potentially adverse, effect on our results of operations.\nThe following table presents select operational and financial information of the Cannabinoid segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n \n\u2022The strike prices of warrants and options.\nGovernments and central banks have responded with monetary and fiscal interventions to stabilize economic conditions and the Company has taken steps to obtain financial assistance made available from jurisdictional governments, however the Company expects its 2021 financial performance to continue to be impacted and result in a delay of certain of its go-to-market initiatives.\nInterest Rate Risk\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\n2.The Non-Cannabinoid operating segment is comprised of the brands and manufacturing assets acquired as part of our acquisition of Herbal Brands. The segment is engaged in the business of formulating, manufacturing, marketing, selling, distributing, and otherwise commercializing wellness products and nutraceuticals, excluding cannabinoid products.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOn August 27, 2020, we amended certain terms of the Herbal Brands Loan to provide for an additional interest of 4% per annum, compounding quarterly and payable in-kind at maturity. In addition, we extended the expiry date of the outstanding 193,402 warrants until May 3, 2023. As part of the amendment, the parties agreed to defer the covenant testing under the Herbal Brands Loan until September 30, 2021.\nOn August 27, 2020, we amended certain terms of the Herbal Brands Loan to provide for an additional interest of 4% per annum, compounding quarterly and payable in-kind at maturity. In addition, we extended the expiry date of the outstanding 193,402 warrants till May 3, 2023. As part of the amendment, the parties agreed that compliance with certain financial covenants under the Herbal Brands Loan will be deferred until September 30, 2021 and will not be required following a Qualified IPO (as defined in the Herbal Brands Loan). The Business Combination meets the definition of Qualified IPO under the Herbal Brands Loan. See Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nIn April and July 2020, Clever Leaves completed the Series E round of financing (the Series E Financing\u201d) and issued an aggregate of approximately $18,396 of senior convertible Class D preferred shares (the Class D preferred shares\u201d) and $4,162 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Debentures due 2023 (the June 2023 Convertible Debentures\u201d). In April 2020, an investor in the Series E Financing exercised its Put Right (as defined below) in full, and Clever Leaves paid $6,250 in exchange for the purchase and cancellation of 711,035 Class C preferred shares. As a result of the Series E Financing and the exercise of the Put Right, the funds raised in the Series E Financing were approximately $16,308.\nCommodity Price Risk\nShare-based compensation\nThe September 2023 Convertible Debentures were to mature on September 30, 2023 (the September 2023 Maturity Date\u201d) and bore interest of 8% per annum, commencing September 30, 2021, payable semi-annually in arrears. At the discretion of Clever Leaves, any interest accrued and payable in respect of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures might, in lieu of being paid to the holders of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures, be added to the principal amount outstanding under the September 2023 Convertible Debentures. Provided that no Liquidity Event has occurred, on the September 2023 Maturity Date, the principal aggregate amount of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures and the accrued and unpaid interest thereon would be payable in cash. At any time prior to the September 2023 Maturity Date or a Liquidity Event, a holder of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures might elect to convert its principal amount of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures and the accrued and unpaid interest thereon into Clever Leaves common shares, at a price per share equal to $5.95 (subject to adjustment). The September 2023 Convertible Debentures, including any accrued and unpaid interest, would be automatically converted into Clever Leaves common shares at a price per Clever Leaves common share equal to 70% of the price attributable to the Clever Leaves common shares upon occurrence of a Liquidity Event, subject to adjustment in the event of the subdivision or consolidation of the outstanding Clever Leaves common shares, the issue of Clever Leaves common shares or securities convertible into Clever Leaves common shares by stock dividend or distribution, or the issue or distribution of rights, options, or warrants to all or substantially all of the holders of Clever Leaves common shares in certain circumstances.\nThe change in net cash used by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily related to a decrease in use of working capital, as well as a lower net loss, net of non-cash items.\nIn April 2019, we acquired Herbal Brands, which manufactures and distributes nutraceutical products to over 15,000 retail locations across the United States. Although the vast majority of our sales to date have been from our Herbal Brands subsidiary, we believe Herbal Brands provides a platform we can leverage for greater cannabinoid distribution in the future.\nThe June 2023 Convertible Debentures were to mature on June 30, 2023 (the 2023 Maturity Date\u201d) and bore interest of 8% per annum, commencing June 30, 2021, payable semi-annually in arrears. At the discretion of Clever Leaves, any interest accrued and payable in respect of the June 2023 Convertible Debentures might, in lieu of being paid to the holders of the June 2023 Convertible Debentures, be added, to the principal amount outstanding under the June 2023 Convertible Debentures. The Business Combination constituted a Liquidity Event (as defined in the indenture governing the June 2023 Convertible Debentures) and resulted in the conversion of all June 2023 Convertible Debentures into Clever Leaves common shares, which were exchanged for our common shares in the Arrangement.\nWe believe that our future success will primarily depend on the following factors:\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nKey Operating Metrics\nOperating expenses\nA Black-Scholes model requires a series of variables, including the:\nCost of Sales - in our Cannabinoid segment, cost of sales is primarily composed of pre-harvest, post-harvest and shipment and fulfillment. Pre-harvest costs include labor and direct materials to grow cannabis, which includes water, electricity, nutrients, integrated pest management, growing supplies and allocated overhead. Post-harvest costs include costs associated with drying, trimming, blending, extraction, purification, quality testing and allocated overhead. Shipment and fulfillment costs include the costs of packaging, labelling, courier services and allocated overhead. Total cost of sales also includes cost of sales associated with accessories and inventory adjustments. In our Non-Cannabinoid segment, cost of sales primarily includes raw materials, labor, and attributable overhead, as well as packaging labelling and fulfillment costs.\nWe use the following key operating metrics to evaluate our business and operations, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, project our future performance and make strategic decisions. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate key operating metrics with similar names differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.\nNon-Cannabinoid. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased to $9,606 from $7,701 for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily attributable to the Herbal Brands business in the U.S., which included four additional months of sales in 2020, partly offset by the slower sales in 2020 due to the impact from COVID-19.\nGNC Bankruptcy\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\n2020 Fourth Quarter Debenture Fundraising\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThe Business Combination resulted in the conversion of all Class D preferred shares into Clever Leaves common shares, which were exchanged for common shares of the Company in the Arrangement.\n\u2022Value of company equity;\nOur management evaluates segment profit/loss for each of the Company's reportable segments. We define segment profit/loss as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses. Segment profit/loss also excludes the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the reportable segments' underlying operating performance. For a reconciliation of segment profit to loss from continuing operations before income taxes, see Note 17. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nConvertible Note Amendments\n\n\u2022Volatility;\nN/M: Not a meaningful percentage\nRevenue by segment\nOur consolidated financial statements are expressed in US dollars, but we have cash, accounts payable and financial instruments denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, including the Canadian dollar, Colombian peso and Euro as our core cultivation, harvest, and distribution operations are conducted in subsidiary locations. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Revenue and expenses of all foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rates that approximate the rates in effect at the dates when such items are recognized. Appreciating foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will adversely impact operating income and net earnings, while depreciating foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will have a positive impact.\n\nCannabinoid. Cannabinoid revenue increased to $2,511 for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $133 for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven primarily by the sale of cannabinoid products as we began to carry out our Cannabinoid sales operations.\nWe continue to monitor closely the impact of COVID-19, with a focus on the health and safety of our employees, and business continuity. We have implemented various measures to reduce the spread of the virus including requiring that our non-production employees work from home, restricting visitors to production locations, screening employees with infrared temperature readings and requiring them to complete health questionnaires on a daily basis before they enter facilities, implementing social distancing measures at our production locations, enhancing facility cleaning protocols, and encouraging employees to adhere to preventative measures recommended by the WHO. Our global operational sites have been reduced to business-critical personnel only and physical distancing measures are in effect. In addition, since our non-production workforce can effectively work remotely using various technology tools, we are able to maintain our full operations. Although our operational sites remain open, mandatory or voluntary self-quarantines may further limit the staffing of our facilities.\nIn March 2019, as part of the Series D financing, Clever Leaves issued $27,750 aggregate principal amount of secured convertible notes (the 2022 Convertible Notes\u201d) with a maturity date of March 30, 2022 (the 2022 Maturity Date\u201d). The 2022 Convertible Notes initially had an interest of 8% per annum, payable quarterly in cash in arrears. The 2022 Convertible Notes are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of Clever Leaves and are secured by pledged equity interests in certain subsidiaries. In March 2020 and June 2020, Clever Leaves and the noteholders amended the terms of the 2022 Convertible Notes, to increase in the interest rate to 10% from January 1, 2020 and provided that such interest is to be paid in-kind on the 2022 Maturity Date.\n1.The Cannabinoid operating segment is comprised of the Company's cultivation, extraction, manufacturing, commercialization, and distribution of cannabinoid products. This operating segment is in the early stages of commercializing cannabinoid products internationally subject to applicable international and state laws and regulations. All our customers and sales for our cannabinoid segment products are presently outside of the U.S.\nCash flows from financing activities\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nContingencies\nGlobal medical market expansion. We believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on expansion of global cannabis markets, as more legal medical cannabis geographies emerge. Medical cannabis is now authorized at the national or federal level in over 41 countries, and more than half of these countries have legalized or introduced significant reforms to their cannabis-use laws to broaden the scope of permitted medical uses beyond the original parameters. Over the past three years, we have established regional operations in Canada, Colombia, Portugal, and Germany, and we have invested significant resources in personnel and partnerships to build the foundation for new export channels.\nComponents of Results of Operations\n\u2022Risk-free rate.\nUncertain economic conditions, fiscal policy and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the capital markets, which would affect the discount rate assumptions, terminal value estimates, and transaction premiums. Such uncertain economic conditions could also have an adverse effect on the fundamentals of our business and results of operations, which would affect our internal forecasts about future performance and terminal value estimates. Furthermore, such uncertain economic conditions could have a negative impact on the industry in general. In addition, the risk factors that we have identified in this Form 10-K and will identify from time to time in our reports could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance, terminal value estimates and transaction premiums. There can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for the purpose of estimating grant date fair value of stock options will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.\nCosts to produce were approximately $0.14 per gram of dry flower equivalent for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $0.21 per gram of dry flower equivalent for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in costs to produce is primarily driven by the expansion of our cultivation capacity facilities in Colombia and the resulting economies of scale.\nThe GACP certification attests that we operate under the guidelines that ensure high quality production and products, according to WHO and European Medicine Agency Guidelines (\"EMA\"), on good agricultural and collection practices for (i) medicinal plants under WHO and (ii) starting materials of herbal origin under EMA. Our operations in Colombia were granted such certification on May 27, 2020, with an inclusion of land on November 9, 2020, which means that all greenhouses operate under GACP.\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nIn August 2020, we received a license from INFARMED to cultivate, import and export dried cannabis flower produced at our Portuguese cultivation site and, similar to other licensed cannabis companies in Portugal, we are listed as of August 2020 on INFARMED's Licensing Department's registry. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions on INFARMED's ability to conduct a physical inspection of our Portuguese operation, the license was issued under a special licensing procedure and requires a confirmatory physical inspection from INFARMED. Our license provides our Portuguese operations the same rights and qualifications as licenses issued under the normal procedures, including the ability to conduct commercial operations. The physical inspection took place on August 27, 2020 and, upon successful completion of the inspection review, we expect our current license to be replaced with a license issued under the normal procedures. Under the current license granted by INFARMED, our production facility in Portugal is currently cultivating cannabis for commercial purposes. Our Portugal facility received the GACP certificate in March 2021. To maintain the GACP certificate, we must cultivate and operate under GACP guidelines.\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the value or yield of fixed-income investments may decline if interest rates change. Fluctuations in interest rates may impact the level of income and expense recorded on our cash equivalents, 2022 Convertible Notes, Herbal Brands Loan, other loans and borrowings and the market value of all interest-earning assets, other than those which possess a short term to maturity. A 1% change in the interest rate in effect on December 31, 2020 would not have a material effect on (i) fair value of our cash equivalents as the majority of the portfolio have a maturity date of three-months or less, or (ii) interest income as interest income is not a significant component of Clever Leaves' earnings and cash flow. In addition, the 2022 Convertible Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 8% and are not publicly traded. Therefore, fair value of the 2022 Convertible Notes and interest expense is not materially affected by changes in the market interest rates. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, for hedging or speculative purposes.\nRevenue increased to $12,117 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $7,834 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was driven primarily by the additional months of sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 from the Herbal Brands business which was acquired in April 2019, as well as the sales in our Cannabinoid segment.\nCash flows from operating activities\nRevenue by Channel\n\u2022The transaction involved other considerations, specifically a financing for Clever Leaves;\nIn the normal course of business, we receive inquiries or become involved in legal disputes regarding various litigation matters. In the opinion of management, as of December 31, 2020 any potential liabilities resulting from claims we have received would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nCost of sales decreased to $4,704 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $4,732 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The slight decrease in 2020 is primarily due to the inclusion in 2019 of additional costs related to the fair value of Herbal Brands inventory following the Herbal Brands acquisition. This was mostly offset by sales of Herbal Brands products, which included an additional four months of sales in 2020, as well as the costs of sales from our Cannabinoid segment sales.\nOperating Results by Business Segment\nHerbal Brands Loan Amendment\nConcurrently with the execution of the Herbal Brands Loan, Clever Leaves issued warrants to the Lender to purchase 193,402 Class C preferred shares of Clever Leaves on a 1:1 basis, at a price of $8.79 per share. The warrants can be exercised in whole or in part at any time prior to the expiration date of May 3, 2021, and are not assignable, transferable, or negotiable. Following the closing of the Business Combination, the warrants issued to the Lender remained outstanding but entitle the Lender to purchase common shares of the Company rather than common shares of Clever Leaves.\nOn June 23, 2020, GNC and its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief pursuant to Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code\u201d) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In September 2020, a bankruptcy court judge approved the sale of GNC to an investor and in the third quarter of 2020, substantially all of the assets of GNC were sold to Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holding Corp. Ltd., and GNC emerged from Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. For more information on the potential impact of GNC on our business, refer to Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business - We currently depend on a limited set of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue. If we fail to retain or expand our customer relationships or if one or more significant customers were to terminate their relationship with us or reduce their purchases, or, our revenue could decline significantly\u201d, as well as Note 9. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been disruptions in supply chains, including the impact on international flights and air-cargo restrictions that has limited the shipping of our products from Colombia to other countries. Since July 10, 2020, international flights from Colombia have resumed on a limited basis and with certain restrictions. In addition, there have been disruptions to our planned expansion of certain product line and production processes. The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected the completion of licensing in Portugal due to INFARMED's impaired ability to conduct physical inspections of our facilities. For more information on the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, refer to Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has caused severe disruptions in the global economy and to our business, and may have an adverse impact on our performance and results of operations.\u201d\nIn April and July 2020, Clever Leaves completed the Series E round of financing (the Series E Financing\u201d) and issued an aggregate of approximately $18,396 of senior convertible Class D preferred shares (the Class D preferred shares\u201d) and $4,162 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Debentures due 2023 (the June 2023 Convertible Debentures\u201d). The Class D preferred shares and the June 2023 Convertible Debentures were converted into Clever Leaves common shares and then into common shares of the Company as part of the Arrangement. For additional details see - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt - Series E Financing\u201d and Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nRevenue\n(b)Costs to produce - includes costs associated with cultivation, extraction, depreciation, quality assurance and supply chain related to kilograms (dry flower) harvested.\n\nOn November 9, 2020, Clever Leaves issued to Neem Holdings, a shareholder of Clever Leaves, a warrant (the Neem Holdings Warrants\u201d) to purchase the number of Clever Leaves common shares (the Warrant Shares\u201d) that would entitle Neem Holdings to receive 300,000 common shares in the Arrangement for an aggregate purchase price of $3. The Neem Holdings Warrants are exercisable for all, but not less than all, of the Warrant Shares and expire at the earlier of (i) the date and time that the Business Combination Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; and (ii) the Arrangement Effective Time. The Neem Holdings Warrants were exercised prior to the Arrangement Effective Time.\n \nLoss on investments. Loss on investment was $464 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a loss of $756 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The loss on investments was primarily related to the decline in the carrying value of our investments in Lift & Co. shares and Cansativa. For more information refer to Note 7. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nWe believe our focus on the production of proprietary and exclusive products or formulations that comply with stringent regulations, or that result in enhanced benefits for patients or consumers, could create advantages in various markets.\n\u2022Time to liquidity event; and\nGoodwill impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a goodwill impairment of $1,682 related to our Herbal Brands business. For more information, see Note 8. and Note 10. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Statements of Net Loss Data\nIn October 2020, Clever Leaves completed a financing, pursuant to which it issued $1,230 aggregate principal amount of September 2023 Convertible Debentures. In addition, on November 9, 2020, certain Subscribers in the SAMA PIPE signed subscription agreements with Clever Leaves to invest $1,500 in the aggregate in additional September 2023 Convertible Debentures as part of the Convertible Debenture Investment. All September 2023 Convertible Debentures were converted into Clever Leaves common shares and then into common shares of the Company as part of the Arrangement. For additional details see - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt - 2020 Fourth Quarter Debenture Financing.\u201d and Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nClass D preferred shares voted together with the Clever Leaves common shares, and were not considered a separate class for voting purposes, except as required by law or in cases of dissolution, liquidation, windup or bankruptcy proceedings which require the consent of a majority of Class D preferred shareholders. The Class D preferred shares carried a liquidation preference (the Class D Liquidation Preference\u201d) of 1.4 times the original issue price of $11.00 for the one-year period following the original issue date, increasing by 0.02 times quarterly to a maximum of 1.75 times the original issue price, in each case subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The Class D Liquidation Preference is payable on a liquidation or merger with, reverse takeover of, or other business combination with, a public company, provided that such transaction does not provide for the conversion of Class D preferred shares into Clever Leaves common shares, or certain other deemed liquidation events (the Class D Liquidation Event\u201d). The Business Combination did not constitute a Class D Liquidation Event. The Class D preferred shares were not redeemable but were convertible at any time, at the option of the holders, into Clever Leaves common shares on a 1:1 basis, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. Automatic conversion into Clever Leaves common shares would occur at the applicable conversion price which takes into account the Class D Liquidation Preference in the event of (1) the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Class D preferred shares consenting to such conversion, (2) an initial public offering or direct listing of Clever Leaves common shares on Nasdaq, NYSE or TSX, or (3) completion of a merger with, reverse takeover of or other business combination with a public company, provided that such transaction provides for the conversion of Class D\n \nOur business model is focused on partnering with leading and emerging cannabis businesses by providing them with lower cost product, variable cost structures, reliable supply throughout the year, and accelerated speed to market. This is achievable due to our production locations, capacity, product registrations and various product certifications. To date, we have had limited export shipments of our cannabis products to Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru, Poland, Spain, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nWe harvested 56,685 kilograms of cannabinoids in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 39,720 kilograms in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the expansion of our cultivation facilities in Colombia.\nWe manage our business in two segments: the Cannabinoid and Non-Cannabinoid segments.\nIn October 2018, as part of the Series C financing, Clever Leaves issued $17,890 aggregate principal amount of noninterest bearing unsecured convertible debentures due 2021 (the 2021 Convertible Debentures\u201d). The 2021 Convertible Debentures had a maturity date of September 30, 2021. All of the 2021 Convertible Debentures were converted into an aggregate of 2,546,670 of Class C preferred shares in March 2019.\nCannabinoid - Cannabinoid segment loss decreased to $18,798 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $25,250 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to cost control measures implemented by us in 2020, as well as increased sales of cannabinoid products. The decrease was partly offset by costs incurred on the expansion of our operations in Colombia, Portugal and Germany.\nLoss on debt extinguishment. Loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2,360 and related primarily to the conversion of the Series E Debentures and the September 2023 Convertible Debentures at the closing of the Business Combination. Loss on debt extinguishment of $3,374 for year ended December 31, 2019 was due to the conversion of our Series C debt of Clever Leaves in March 2019 into Class C preferred shares that were subsequently exchanged for common shares of the Company at the closing of the Business Combination. For more information, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nIn April 2019, to facilitate the financing the Herbal Brands acquisition, Herbal Brands entered into the Herbal Brands Loan with, and issued warrants to, a third-party lender, Rock Cliff Capital LLC ( Lender\u201d). The Herbal Brands Loan was amended in August 2020. For further details on the Herbal Brands acquisition, see Note 8. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nSources of Liquidity\nWe did not have off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented, other than the obligations discussed above.\npayments already paid (excluding PIK interest paid and PIK interest capitalized as outstanding principal) on such prepayment date. The Herbal Brands Loan is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company, secured by Herbal Brands' assets and equity interests in Herbal Brands and is subject to certain covenants. The Herbal Brands Loan remained outstanding following the closing of the Business Combination.\nHerbal Brands Debt", "item_7_text": "On November 9, 2020, certain Subscribers in the SAMA PIPE signed subscription agreements with Clever Leaves to invest $1,500 in the aggregate in additional September 2023 Convertible Debentures.\nPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, each of the following transactions occurred in the following order: (i) pursuant to a court-approved Canadian plan of arrangement (the Plan of Arrangement\u201d and the arrangement pursuant to such Plan of Arrangement, the Arrangement\u201d), at 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on December 17, 2020 (2:59 a.m., Eastern time, on December 18, 2020) (a) all of the Clever Leaves shareholders exchanged their Class A common shares without par value of Clever Leaves ( Clever Leaves common shares\u201d) for our common shares without par value ( common shares\u201d) and/or non-voting common shares without par value ( non-voting common shares\u201d) (as determined in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement) and (b) certain Clever Leaves shareholders received approximately $3,100 in cash in the aggregate (the Cash Arrangement Consideration\u201d), such that, immediately following the Arrangement, Clever Leaves became our direct wholly-owned subsidiary; (ii) at 12:01 a.m., Pacific time (3:01 a.m. Eastern time), on December 18, 2020, Merger Sub merged with and into SAMA, with SAMA surviving such merger as our direct wholly-owned subsidiary (the Merger\u201d) and, as a result of the Merger, all of the shares of SAMA common stock were converted into the right to receive common shares as set forth in the Business Combination Agreement; (iii) immediately following the consummation of the Merger, we contributed 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SAMA (as the surviving corporation of the Merger) to Clever Leaves, such that, SAMA became a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Clever Leaves; and (iv) immediately following the contribution of SAMA to Clever Leaves, Clever Leaves contributed 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of NS US Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clever Leaves, to SAMA. Upon the closing of the Merger, SAMA changed its name to Clever Leaves US, Inc.\nWe have historically been able to manage liquidity requirements through cost management and cost reduction measures, supplemented with raising additional financing. While Clever Leaves has been successful in raising financing in the past, and did so as recently as November 2020, there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. The continued spread of COVID-19 (see - Recent Developments - COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d for a discussion on COVID-19) and uncertain market conditions may further limit our ability to access capital. If we are not able to secure adequate additional funding, we may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, and suspend or curtail planned programs. Any of these actions could materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nN/M: Not a meaningful percentage.\n \nIn connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, the Company, 1255096 B.C. Ltd., an indirect subsidiary of the Company, and Clever Leaves US, Inc.

To manage this exposure, Clever Leaves uses purchase commitments for some of the key commodity needs in the normal course of its business and manages selling prices to its customers to offset the effects of significant commodity price changes.\n\nAmounts are presented in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for per share data or as otherwise noted.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nThe Business Combination constituted a Liquidity Event and resulted in the conversion of all September 2023 Convertible Debentures into Clever Leaves common shares, which were exchanged for common shares of the Company in the Arrangement. For additional details see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nSeries E Financing\nAs part of the Series E Financing in April 2020, Clever Leaves granted an investor in the Series E Financing a right to cause Clever Leaves to purchase up to 711,035 of the investor's previously purchased Class C preferred shares (the Put Right\u201d) at the investor's original purchase price of $8.79 per share. On April 13, 2020, the investor exercised the Put Right in full, and Clever Leaves paid $6,250 in exchange for its purchase and cancellation of 711,035 Class C preferred shares. In addition, as part of the July 2020 portion of the Series E Financing, three investors, in aggregate, exchanged 848,363 Class C preferred shares for 646,846 Class D preferred shares.\nOn November 9, 2020, Clever Leaves and the Company entered into the Neem Holdings Convertible Note with a principal amount of $3,000 in favor of Neem Holdings. On the same day, Clever Leaves issued the Neem Holdings Warrants that, if exercised, would entitle Neem Holdings to receive 300,000 common shares in the Arrangement. The Neem Holdings Convertible Note was repaid on December 23, 2020. The Neem Holdings Warrants were exercised prior to the Arrangement Effective Time. For additional details see - Recent Developments - Neem Holdings Convertible Note and Neem Holdings Warrants\u201d and Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nNotable 2020 Developments\nFollowing the closing of the Business Combination, the 2022 Convertible Notes remained outstanding, but are convertible into our common shares in accordance with their terms. In connection with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, Clever Leaves issued 9,509 warrants to acquire Clever Leaves common shares to one of the noteholders. The warrants vest when the 2022 Convertible Note issued to the warrantholder is converted into shares and expire on March 30, 2023. The warrants will be cancelled if the 2022 Convertible Note issued to the warrantholder is repaid.\nClosing of the Business Combination\nThe Company expects its operations to continue to be affected by the recent and ongoing outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease ( COVID-19\u201d), which was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. The spread of COVID-19 has severely impacted many economies around the globe. In many countries, including those where the Company operates, businesses are being forced to cease or limit operations for long or indefinite periods of time. Measures taken to contain the spread of the virus, including travel bans, quarantines, social distancing, and closures of non-essential services have triggered significant disruptions to businesses worldwide, resulting in an economic slowdown. Global stock markets have also experienced increased volatility and, in certain cases, significant declines.\nCash flows from investing activities\nTotal debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019 was $33,728. The 2019 balance relates to the 2022 Convertible Notes issued in March 2019, as well as the Herbal Brands Loan.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, on November 9, 2020, Clever Leaves and the noteholders agreed to amend the terms of the 2022 Convertible Notes to: (i) decrease the interest rate to 8%, commencing January 1, 2021, and provide that such interest is to be paid in cash, quarterly in arrears; (ii) provide for the payment of all accrued and outstanding interest from January 1 to December 31, 2020 to be made in the form of PIK Notes; to consent to the transfer of the PIK Notes to SAMA in exchange for the PIPE Shares to be issued as part of the SAMA PIPE pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreements; (iii) at the option of Clever Leaves, satisfy the payment of quarterly interest by issuing our common shares to the noteholders, at a price per share equal to 95% of the 10-Day VWAP; (iv) at the option of Clever Leaves, prepay, in cash, any or all amounts outstanding under the 2022 Convertible Notes at any time without penalty; (v) at the option of Clever Leaves on each quarterly interest payment date, repay principal and any other amounts outstanding under the 2022 Convertible Notes up to the lesser of (a) $2,000, or (b) an amount equal to four times the average value of the daily volume of common shares traded during the 10-Day VWAP period, of the total amounts outstanding under the 2022 Convertible Notes at such time by issuing common shares to the noteholders at a price per share equal to 95% of the 10-Day VWAP; and (vi) at the option of each noteholder, in the event, following the Merger Effective Time, Clever Leaves, the Company or any of their respective affiliates proposes to issue equity securities for cash or cash equivalents (the Equity Financing\u201d) (save and except for certain exempt issuances) at any time after Clever Leaves, the Company or any of their respective affiliates completes one or more equity financings raising, in aggregate, net proceeds of $25,000 (net of reasonable fees, including reasonable accounting, advisory and legal fees, commissions and other out-of-pocket expenses and inclusive of net cash retained as a result of the Business Combination on the Merger Effective Time), convert an amount of principal and/or accrued interest owing under the 2022 Convertible Notes into subscriptions to purchase up to the noteholder's pro rata share of 25% of the total securities issued under such Equity Financing on the same terms and conditions as such Equity Financing is offered to subscribers; provided, however, that if the noteholder does not elect to participate in such Equity Financing through the conversion of amounts owing under the 2022 Convertible Notes, then Clever Leaves shall be required to repay, in cash within five (5) business days following the closing of such Equity Financing, an amount equal to the noteholder's pro rata share of 25% of the total net proceeds raised from such Equity Financing (collectively, the November 2020 Convertible Note Amendments\u201d).\nSeries E Round of Fundraising\nAs Clever Leaves shares were not publicly traded at the time of grant, it engaged independent third-party valuation specialists to assist with determining the estimated fair value of Clever Leaves' common shares at each grant date under a multi-stage process, which involved calculating the enterprise and equity value of Clever Leaves. The enterprise value was initially calculated using the discounted cash flows method under the income approach and the prior sales of company stock method under the market approach, weighted based on Clever Leaves' current stage of development, its financial projections and the timing of the prior sales of a company's securities.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 we sold 24,035 and 644 kilograms, respectively, of dry flower equivalents. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our cannabinoid segment sales were primarily in Colombia, Australia, Israel and Brazil. The increase was primarily driven by the Company commencing its sales activity for cannabinoid products.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $1,854 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1,480 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to capital expenditures for the expansion of our cultivation and extraction assets. Additionally, the increase is attributable to the amortization of finite-lived intangible assets acquired as part of the Herbal Brands acquisition, which included an additional four months of amortization in 2020 compared\nFor further details, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nIn connection with the November 2020 Convertible Note Amendments, the Required Holders (as that term is defined in the amended and restated intercreditor and collateral agency agreement, dated as of May 10, 2019, in respect of the 2022 Convertible Notes) have agreed to waive Clever Leaves' required compliance with certain restrictive covenants set forth in the\nResults of Operations\nNon-operating income and expenses\n\nThe increase in net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to the higher proceeds from debt and equity financings in 2020 compared to 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the financing activities related primarily to the Business Combination and the Series E Financing of Clever Leaves, whereas during the year ended December 31, 2019, Clever Leaves issued Series D preferred shares, 2022 Convertible Notes and debt incurred in connection with the Herbal Brands acquisition. For more information, see Note 9. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nThe Herbal Brands Loan is a non-revolving loan with a principal amount of $8,500 and interest of 8% per annum due and payable in arrears on the first day of each fiscal quarter, commencing July 1, 2019, and calculated based on the actual number of days elapsed. In addition, Herbal Brands is required to pay in kind interest (\"PIK\") on the outstanding principal amount of the Herbal Brands Loan from August 27, 2020 until payment in full at a rate equal to 4.0% per annum, with such PIK interest being capitalized as additional principal to increase the outstanding principal balance of the Herbal Brands Loan on the first day of each fiscal quarter. The Herbal Brands Loan is to be repaid or prepaid prior to its maturity date of May 2, 2023. On a quarterly basis, the loan requires Herbal Brands to repay 85% of positive operating cash flows. Herbal Brands can also choose to prepay a portion or the Herbal Brands Loan, subject to a fee equal to the greater of (1) zero, and (2) $2,337.5, net of interest\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nOn December 18, 2020, Clever Leaves and SAMA consummated the previously announced Business Combination contemplated by the Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement, dated as of November 9, 2020, by and among SAMA, Clever Leaves, the Company and Merger Sub.\nHowever, subject to the valuation date, the economic differences between common shares and Class D shares noted above may be accounted for in the calculation of the indicated equity value. The Class D transaction was considered an arm's-length transaction and that the price derived from this transaction can be relied upon in calculating the fair value of Clever Leaves' common share at a valuation date close to the occurrence of the transaction. However, the transaction involving another class of stock (Class D) occurred more than six months prior to the valuation date, and was determined to have included other considerations involved in the investment decision (such as financing reasons, etc.), all of which suggest that the price derived from this transaction cannot be relied upon in determining the fair value of common shares as of the valuation date. As such, the discounted cash flows method under the income approach is used in calculating the fair value of Clever Leaves' common shares.\n\n\u2022The liquidation preferences of preferred shares (including seniority of any series of preferred shares);\nUses of Liquidity\nRecent Developments\nProduct development and innovation. Because of the rapid evolution of the cannabis industry, the disparate regulations across different geographies, and the time required to develop and validate pharmaceutical-grade products, the pace at which we can expand our portfolio of products and formulations will impact market acceptance for our products. To increase our output while maintaining or reducing unit costs, we may need to enhance our cultivation, extraction, and other processing methods.\nThe duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of government and central bank responses, remains unclear. It is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of these consequences, nor their impact on the financial position and results of the Company for future periods.\nUnlike several cannabis operators, which in many cases are confined to one geography and may rely on initial market protections afforded by the existing regulatory framework, we can scale our production in low-cost regions of the world, such as Colombia and Portugal, while maintaining access to some higher value-added end markets such as the EU because of our EU GMP certification and global network.\nWe manage our liquidity risk by preparing budgets and cash forecasts to ensure we have sufficient funds to meet obligations. In managing working capital, we may limit the amount of our cash needs by selling inventory at wholesale rates, pursuing additional financing sources, and managing the timing of capital expenditures. While we believe we have sufficient cash to meet working capital requirements in the short term, we may need additional sources of capital and/or financing, to meet planned growth requirements and to fund construction activities at our cultivation and processing facilities.\nStrategically expanding productive capacity and manufacturing capabilities. It is beneficial to have low operating costs and to control the production process to generate consistency and quality on a large scale. As we expand into new markets and grow our presence in existing markets, we expect significant investments in cultivation and processing will be required, which may necessitate additional capital raises. We also aim to increase productive capacity through innovation in cultivation or processing methods, improving yields and output levels of our existing assets. While we believe our core cultivation and extraction operations in Colombia are adequately sized for our current business operations, as our cannabis sales grow and expand to flower products, we plan to expand our operations and invest in advanced processing or finished good manufacturing capabilities, particularly in Colombia and Portugal.\nOn November 9, 2020, Clever Leaves and the Company entered into an unsecured subordinated convertible note (the Neem Holdings Convertible Note\u201d) with a principal amount of $3,000 in favor of Neem Holdings, LLC ( Neem Holdings\u201d), a shareholder of Clever Leaves. Clever Leaves is required to repay the Neem Holdings Convertible Note within 10 business days after the closing of the Business Combination, and the Company has agreed to promptly satisfy this obligation in full. The Neem Holdings Convertible Note is interest free. The Neem Holdings Convertible Note was repaid on December 23, 2020.\nto 2019, as well as higher amortization expense during the second half of 2020 due to the acceleration of the period over which the useful life of the GNC intangible asset is amortized, as described under -Recent Developments - GNC Bankruptcy\u201d and Note 9. and Note 11. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, on November 9, 2020, Clever Leaves and the noteholders agreed to amend the terms of the 2022 Convertible Notes to, among other matters, decrease the interest rate to 8%, commencing January 1, 2021, and provide that such interest is to be paid in cash, quarterly in arrears, and also provides the Company with the option to satisfy the payment of quarterly interest by issuing common shares to the noteholders.\nOn October 23, 2020, Clever Leaves completed the first tranche of a financing pursuant to which it issued $1,230 aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due September 30, 2023 (the September 2023 Convertible Debentures\u201d).\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d should be read in conjunction with the Business\u201d section and our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The financial information contained herein is taken or derived from such consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise indicated. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those that are discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly under Risk Factors.\u201d\nSegment profit/loss\nForeign exchange loss. The impact of foreign exchange for the year ended December 31, 2020 was a loss of $491 compared to a loss of $1,575 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The foreign exchange losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were primarily driven by the currency fluctuations of the Colombian peso versus the U.S. Dollar.\nThe same certification was granted to our operation in Portugal on February 22, 2021, for its greenhouse and postharvest facility.\nEU GMP Certification\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe estimate the fair value of equity classified stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options are outlined in Note 15. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nOn December 18, 2020, SAMA's units, shares of SAMA common stock and warrants ceased trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq\u201d), and our common shares and warrants began trading on Nasdaq under the symbols CLVR\u201d and CLVRW,\u201d respectively. For further details, see Note 8. and Note 13. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nsquare feet of land for cultivation expansion. Our Colombian cultivation operations have one of the largest greenhouse capacities licensed for cannabis production in Latin America, and have been granted GACP certification by CUMCS. Our Colombian manufacturing facilities were granted Colombian GMP certification by INVIMA in August 2019 and EU GMP certification by HALMED in July 2020. Our post-harvest facility also received EU GMP certification in July 2020. We are the first company to legally export cannabinoids from Colombia, and we are among a small number of cannabis companies in the world to receive EU GMP certification. EU GMP certification is a required qualification to import medical cannabis products into the European market, which adheres to strict pharmaceutical quality standards. In August 2020, our operations in Portugal were provisionally licensed for the commercial cultivation, import and export of medical cannabis by INFARMED. Our Portugal facility received the GACP certificate in March 2021.\nFollowing the closing of the Business Combination, the 2022 Convertible Notes remained outstanding, but are convertible into our common shares in accordance with their terms. For additional detail see \" - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt - Convertible Note Amendments\" and Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\n\u2022The transaction occurred just prior to the valuation date.\n(a) For a reconciliation of segment profit/(loss) to loss before income taxes see Note 17. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nRegulatory expertise and adaptation. As more markets welcome the importation of cannabis or hemp products for commercial purposes, which requires navigating and complying with the strict and evolving cannabis regulations across the different geographies, we believe that we are well positioned to expand in these markets. Clever Leaves has built a global regulatory team that is experienced in developing good relationships with regulatory agencies and governments that govern and shape the cannabis industry in their respective jurisdictions. Key expertise includes complying with and securing quotas, product approvals, export permits, import permits and other geographic specific licenses.\nN/M: Not a meaningful percentage\n_______________\nWe are a multi-national cannabis company with the mission to be an industry-leading global cannabinoid company recognized for our principles, people and performance while fostering a healthier global community. We are working to develop one of the industry's leading, low-cost global business-to-business supply chains with the goal of providing high quality, pharmaceutical grade cannabis and wellness products to customers and patients at competitive prices. In addition to the cannabinoid business, we are also engaged in the non-cannabinoid business of formulating, manufacturing, marketing, selling, distributing, and otherwise commercializing homeopathic and other natural remedies, wellness products, and nutraceuticals. We continue to invest in building a distribution network with a global footprint, with operations and investments in Colombia, Portugal, Germany, the United States and Canada.\nNon-Cannabinoid - Non-Cannabinoid segment profit increased to $1,863 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $614 the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to cost control measures implemented during 2020, as well as the additional four months of activity in the 2020 period, partly offset by lower sales in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nThe Class D transaction did not involve common shares, but instead involved preferred shares. In addition, in light of the substantial economic and legal advantages for Class D shareholders, common shares of Clever Leaves were viewed to be worth less than shares of Class D. The Class D shares have liquidation preferences, the power to block financings or sales, and the ability to withhold approval of any new series or shares of capital stock that have any rights that are senior or pari passu to Class D. Common shares do not have these advantages and the value of Class D does not reflect the value of the Clever Leaves' common share.\nGlobalization of the industry. Due to our MNO model focused on geographic diversification, which distinguishes us from many of our competitors and allows us to scale our production in low-cost regions of the world, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize in markets where the medical cannabis and hemp industry offers a reasonably regulated and free flow of goods across national boundaries. While certain countries, such as Canada, have historically not welcomed imported cannabis or hemp products for commercial purposes, other countries, such as Germany and Brazil, depend primarily on imports.\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe enterprise value was then adjusted for the Clever Leaves' cash and debt as of the valuation date and the resulting equity value was allocated using the option pricing method. The value per common share was then reduced by a discount for lack of marketability to put it on a minority, non-marketable basis.\nConvertible notes\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased to $29,828 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $34,979 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower office and administration and employee-related costs, such as salaries and benefits, following certain measures we took to reduce costs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nClever Leaves monitors its cash balances and cash flows generated from operations to ensure there is sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as they come due. Liquidity management is comprised of regular analysis, monitoring, and review of forecasted and actual cash flows, and managing operational and capital funding requirements on a planned and projected basis. As of December 31, 2020, Clever Leaves' financial liabilities mainly comprise accounts payables, short-term liability, and other current liabilities which would be paid within 12 months, as well as the 2022 Convertible Notes, the Herbal Brands Loan and other loans and borrowings. For more information on our liquidity requirements see - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d above.\nThe decrease in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily related to the Herbal Brands acquisition, our investment in Cansativa, as well as higher capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe primarily financed our operations through the issuance of preferred shares, the sale of convertible notes and cash from operations. As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $79,107 and $12,044, respectively, which were held for working capital and general corporate purposes. This represents an overall increase of $67,063.\nFor further details, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4,455 compared to $2,684 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to increased interest expense associated with the 2022 Convertible Notes, as well as a promissory note issued in relation to the Herbal Brands acquisition. Additionally, the increase reflects higher interest rates during 2020 related to the amendment in March 2020 of the terms of the 2022 Convertible Notes. For additional details, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\n\u2022The participation rights of preferred shares (including any caps on such participation); and\nCost of sales\nThe following table sets forth the major components of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods presented:\nIn March 2020, Clever Leaves closed a round of class D Convertible Preferred Shares (Class D). Clever Leaves sold 1,308,740 shares of Class D to several investors, for a total of $14,400. While prior sales of a company's securities can be considered in establishing the current value of a company, the circumstances surrounding such a sale must be considered. In this case, these circumstances included:\n2020 Fourth Quarter Debenture Financing\nFollowing the closing of the Business Combination and pursuant to the terms, the holder of the Rock Cliff Warrants can purchase 63,597 of the Company's common shares at a strike price of $26.73 per share.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance U.S. GAAP. A detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 3. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We have identified certain policies and estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our past or present results of operations related to (i) consolidation, (ii) inventories, (iii) investments, (iv) property, plant and equipment, (v) intangible assets, (vi) business combinations and goodwill, (vii) equity method investments, (viii) leases, (ix) revenue recognition, (x) complex financial instruments. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or they have the potential to have a material impact, on our consolidated financial statements and because they require us to make significant judgments, assumptions, or estimates. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions made were reasonable, based on information available at the time they were made. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nSubsequent to the completion of the Series E Financing, 4,429,559 Class C preferred shares, 2,319,215 Class D preferred shares and $4,162 principal amount of the June 2023 Convertible Debentures were outstanding. All Class C preferred shares, Class D preferred shares and June 2023 Convertible Debentures were converted into Clever Leaves common shares and then into common shares of the Company as part of the Arrangement.\nLoss on fair value of derivative instrument. For the year ended December 31, 2020 we experienced a loss of $657 compared to loss of $421 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the conversion of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven by the initial recognition of a derivative instrument related to the Company's holding of Lift & Co. warrants. For additional details, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nOur primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service obligations and for general corporate purposes. Our ability to fund operations and make planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations depends on future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors. Our consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that we will continue to be in operation for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of operations as they come due.\nPortugal Licensing\nDebt\nThe Black-Scholes implementation of the option pricing method treats the rights of holders of various classes of securities (preferred shares, common shares, warrants, and options) as call options on any value of Clever Leaves above a series of break points. The values of the break points were calculated by reviewing:\nFactors Impacting our Business\nOther (income) expenses, net. Other (income) expenses, net includes costs not individually material to our consolidated financial statements.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $2,577 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $3,183 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to our cost control measures to address the impact from COVID-19. Additionally, in the prior year period, we incurred higher sales and marketing costs in connection with the exploration of potential new export markets for our cannabinoid products. The decline was partly offset by an increase in marketing and selling costs related to the Herbal Brands business in the U.S., which included an additional four months of costs in 2020 compared to 2019.\nTotal net debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020 was $33,843. The balance is comprised of 2022 Convertible Notes of approximately $27,750 issued in March 2019, the debt of $8,500 issued to finance the Herbal Brands acquisition in April 2019, as well as other borrowings, net of principal repayments for the Herbal Brands Loan and debt issuance costs. For more information, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nIn connection with the closing of the Business Combination we received approximately $73,509 of net proceeds (refer to Note 8. to the audited consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K). We have had operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future until such time, if ever, that it can generate significant revenues from the sale of its available inventories. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses from operations due to pre-commercialization activities, marketing and manufacturing activities, and general and administrative costs to support operations.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, we own over 1.9 million square feet of greenhouse cultivation capacity across two continents and approximately 13 million square feet of agricultural land, with an option to acquire approximately 73 million additional\nIn connection with the Clever Leaves audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, our management determined that there were material uncertainties which caused substantial doubt about Clever Leaves' ability to continue as a going concern, absent additional financing and cost reduction or cost management measures. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, we received approximately $73,509 of net proceeds (refer to Note 8. to the audited consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K). We believe that cash on hand is sufficient to satisfy the Company's estimated liquidity needs during the twelve months from the issuance of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. If this amount is subsequently insufficient for us to continue to operate as a going concern, we may need to raise additional cash through debt, equity or other forms of financing to fund future operations which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n(a)Kilograms (dry flower) harvested - represents the weight of dried plants post-harvest both for sale and for research and development purposes. This operating metric is used to measure the productivity of our farms.\nNeem Holdings Convertible Note and Neem Holdings Warrants\nThe following table provides our revenues by channel for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nOn July 8, 2020, Clever Leaves received EU GMP certification from the HALMED for its post-harvest and extraction facilities located in Colombia. EU GMP certification is expected to expand Clever Leaves' ability to serve the burgeoning European medical cannabis and hemp markets, which have rigorous quality, compliance, and regulatory requirements. Because we are among a small number of companies globally to have earned EU GMP certification, EU GMP certification is also expected to expand our early mover advantage in the pharmaceutical channel as global demand increases and more legal cannabis geographies emerge.\nPortugal Licensing\nNeem Holdings Convertible Note and Neem Holdings Warrants\nThe discounted cash flows method under the income approach adds the present value of projected cash flows generated by operations of the company and the present value of the residual or terminal value of the company. The present values of the cash flows and the terminal value are calculated using discount rates that reflect the time value of money and the risk of the company and the projected cash flows. The greater the perceived risk associated with the forecasted cash flows, the higher the discount rate applied to them, and the lower their present value. The prior sales of company stock method under the market approach uses prices of actual transactions in a company's own securities to infer the value of the security being valued. There may be adjustments needed to deal with differences in the securities (e.g. preferred share instead of common share), standard value (e.g. control vs. non-control or marketable vs. non-marketable), and the passage of time.\nA 10% change in the exchange rates for the foreign currencies would affect the carrying value of net assets by approximately $230 as of December 31, 2020, with a corresponding impact to foreign exchange loss. We have not historically engaged in hedging transactions and do not currently contemplate engaging in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks. As we continue to recognize gains and losses in foreign currency transactions, depending upon changes in future currency rates, such gains or losses could have a significant, and potentially adverse, effect on our results of operations.\nThe following table presents select operational and financial information of the Cannabinoid segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n \n\u2022The strike prices of warrants and options.\nGovernments and central banks have responded with monetary and fiscal interventions to stabilize economic conditions and the Company has taken steps to obtain financial assistance made available from jurisdictional governments, however the Company expects its 2021 financial performance to continue to be impacted and result in a delay of certain of its go-to-market initiatives.\nInterest Rate Risk\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\n2.The Non-Cannabinoid operating segment is comprised of the brands and manufacturing assets acquired as part of our acquisition of Herbal Brands. The segment is engaged in the business of formulating, manufacturing, marketing, selling, distributing, and otherwise commercializing wellness products and nutraceuticals, excluding cannabinoid products. Our principal customers for the Herbal Brands products include specialty and health retailers, mass retailers and specialty and health stores in the U.S.\n(c)Kilograms sold - represents the amount in kilograms of product sold in dry plant equivalents.

In our Non-Cannabinoid segment, revenue is primarily composed of sales of our nutraceutical products to our retail customers. As we have only recently begun to carry out our cannabinoid sales operations, our main revenues are derived from our Herbal Brands business.\nThese certificates must be yearly renewed.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOn August 27, 2020, we amended certain terms of the Herbal Brands Loan to provide for an additional interest of 4% per annum, compounding quarterly and payable in-kind at maturity. In addition, we extended the expiry date of the outstanding 193,402 warrants until May 3, 2023. As part of the amendment, the parties agreed to defer the covenant testing under the Herbal Brands Loan until September 30, 2021.\nOn August 27, 2020, we amended certain terms of the Herbal Brands Loan to provide for an additional interest of 4% per annum, compounding quarterly and payable in-kind at maturity. In addition, we extended the expiry date of the outstanding 193,402 warrants till May 3, 2023. As part of the amendment, the parties agreed that compliance with certain financial covenants under the Herbal Brands Loan will be deferred until September 30, 2021 and will not be required following a Qualified IPO (as defined in the Herbal Brands Loan). The Business Combination meets the definition of Qualified IPO under the Herbal Brands Loan. See Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nIn April and July 2020, Clever Leaves completed the Series E round of financing (the Series E Financing\u201d) and issued an aggregate of approximately $18,396 of senior convertible Class D preferred shares (the Class D preferred shares\u201d) and $4,162 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Debentures due 2023 (the June 2023 Convertible Debentures\u201d). In April 2020, an investor in the Series E Financing exercised its Put Right (as defined below) in full, and Clever Leaves paid $6,250 in exchange for the purchase and cancellation of 711,035 Class C preferred shares. As a result of the Series E Financing and the exercise of the Put Right, the funds raised in the Series E Financing were approximately $16,308.\nCommodity Price Risk\nShare-based compensation\nThe September 2023 Convertible Debentures were to mature on September 30, 2023 (the September 2023 Maturity Date\u201d) and bore interest of 8% per annum, commencing September 30, 2021, payable semi-annually in arrears. At the discretion of Clever Leaves, any interest accrued and payable in respect of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures might, in lieu of being paid to the holders of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures, be added to the principal amount outstanding under the September 2023 Convertible Debentures. Provided that no Liquidity Event has occurred, on the September 2023 Maturity Date, the principal aggregate amount of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures and the accrued and unpaid interest thereon would be payable in cash. At any time prior to the September 2023 Maturity Date or a Liquidity Event, a holder of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures might elect to convert its principal amount of the September 2023 Convertible Debentures and the accrued and unpaid interest thereon into Clever Leaves common shares, at a price per share equal to $5.95 (subject to adjustment). The September 2023 Convertible Debentures, including any accrued and unpaid interest, would be automatically converted into Clever Leaves common shares at a price per Clever Leaves common share equal to 70% of the price attributable to the Clever Leaves common shares upon occurrence of a Liquidity Event, subject to adjustment in the event of the subdivision or consolidation of the outstanding Clever Leaves common shares, the issue of Clever Leaves common shares or securities convertible into Clever Leaves common shares by stock dividend or distribution, or the issue or distribution of rights, options, or warrants to all or substantially all of the holders of Clever Leaves common shares in certain circumstances.\nThe change in net cash used by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily related to a decrease in use of working capital, as well as a lower net loss, net of non-cash items.\nIn April 2019, we acquired Herbal Brands, which manufactures and distributes nutraceutical products to over 15,000 retail locations across the United States. Although the vast majority of our sales to date have been from our Herbal Brands subsidiary, we believe Herbal Brands provides a platform we can leverage for greater cannabinoid distribution in the future.\nThe June 2023 Convertible Debentures were to mature on June 30, 2023 (the 2023 Maturity Date\u201d) and bore interest of 8% per annum, commencing June 30, 2021, payable semi-annually in arrears. At the discretion of Clever Leaves, any interest accrued and payable in respect of the June 2023 Convertible Debentures might, in lieu of being paid to the holders of the June 2023 Convertible Debentures, be added, to the principal amount outstanding under the June 2023 Convertible Debentures. The Business Combination constituted a Liquidity Event (as defined in the indenture governing the June 2023 Convertible Debentures) and resulted in the conversion of all June 2023 Convertible Debentures into Clever Leaves common shares, which were exchanged for our common shares in the Arrangement.\nWe believe that our future success will primarily depend on the following factors:\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nKey Operating Metrics\nOperating expenses\nA Black-Scholes model requires a series of variables, including the:\nCost of Sales - in our Cannabinoid segment, cost of sales is primarily composed of pre-harvest, post-harvest and shipment and fulfillment. Pre-harvest costs include labor and direct materials to grow cannabis, which includes water, electricity, nutrients, integrated pest management, growing supplies and allocated overhead. Post-harvest costs include costs associated with drying, trimming, blending, extraction, purification, quality testing and allocated overhead. Shipment and fulfillment costs include the costs of packaging, labelling, courier services and allocated overhead. Total cost of sales also includes cost of sales associated with accessories and inventory adjustments. In our Non-Cannabinoid segment, cost of sales primarily includes raw materials, labor, and attributable overhead, as well as packaging labelling and fulfillment costs.\nWe use the following key operating metrics to evaluate our business and operations, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, project our future performance and make strategic decisions. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate key operating metrics with similar names differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.\nNon-Cannabinoid. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased to $9,606 from $7,701 for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily attributable to the Herbal Brands business in the U.S., which included four additional months of sales in 2020, partly offset by the slower sales in 2020 due to the impact from COVID-19.\nGNC Bankruptcy\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\n2020 Fourth Quarter Debenture Fundraising\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThe Business Combination resulted in the conversion of all Class D preferred shares into Clever Leaves common shares, which were exchanged for common shares of the Company in the Arrangement.\n\u2022Value of company equity;\nOur management evaluates segment profit/loss for each of the Company's reportable segments. We define segment profit/loss as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses. Segment profit/loss also excludes the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the reportable segments' underlying operating performance. For a reconciliation of segment profit to loss from continuing operations before income taxes, see Note 17. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nConvertible Note Amendments\n\n\u2022Volatility;\nN/M: Not a meaningful percentage\nRevenue by segment\nOur consolidated financial statements are expressed in US dollars, but we have cash, accounts payable and financial instruments denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, including the Canadian dollar, Colombian peso and Euro as our core cultivation, harvest, and distribution operations are conducted in subsidiary locations. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Revenue and expenses of all foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rates that approximate the rates in effect at the dates when such items are recognized. Appreciating foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will adversely impact operating income and net earnings, while depreciating foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will have a positive impact.\n\nCannabinoid. Cannabinoid revenue increased to $2,511 for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $133 for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven primarily by the sale of cannabinoid products as we began to carry out our Cannabinoid sales operations.\nWe continue to monitor closely the impact of COVID-19, with a focus on the health and safety of our employees, and business continuity. We have implemented various measures to reduce the spread of the virus including requiring that our non-production employees work from home, restricting visitors to production locations, screening employees with infrared temperature readings and requiring them to complete health questionnaires on a daily basis before they enter facilities, implementing social distancing measures at our production locations, enhancing facility cleaning protocols, and encouraging employees to adhere to preventative measures recommended by the WHO. Our global operational sites have been reduced to business-critical personnel only and physical distancing measures are in effect. In addition, since our non-production workforce can effectively work remotely using various technology tools, we are able to maintain our full operations. Although our operational sites remain open, mandatory or voluntary self-quarantines may further limit the staffing of our facilities.\nIn March 2019, as part of the Series D financing, Clever Leaves issued $27,750 aggregate principal amount of secured convertible notes (the 2022 Convertible Notes\u201d) with a maturity date of March 30, 2022 (the 2022 Maturity Date\u201d). The 2022 Convertible Notes initially had an interest of 8% per annum, payable quarterly in cash in arrears. The 2022 Convertible Notes are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of Clever Leaves and are secured by pledged equity interests in certain subsidiaries. In March 2020 and June 2020, Clever Leaves and the noteholders amended the terms of the 2022 Convertible Notes, to increase in the interest rate to 10% from January 1, 2020 and provided that such interest is to be paid in-kind on the 2022 Maturity Date.\n1.The Cannabinoid operating segment is comprised of the Company's cultivation, extraction, manufacturing, commercialization, and distribution of cannabinoid products. This operating segment is in the early stages of commercializing cannabinoid products internationally subject to applicable international and state laws and regulations. All our customers and sales for our cannabinoid segment products are presently outside of the U.S.\nCash flows from financing activities\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nContingencies\nGlobal medical market expansion. We believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on expansion of global cannabis markets, as more legal medical cannabis geographies emerge. Medical cannabis is now authorized at the national or federal level in over 41 countries, and more than half of these countries have legalized or introduced significant reforms to their cannabis-use laws to broaden the scope of permitted medical uses beyond the original parameters. Over the past three years, we have established regional operations in Canada, Colombia, Portugal, and Germany, and we have invested significant resources in personnel and partnerships to build the foundation for new export channels.\nComponents of Results of Operations\n\u2022Risk-free rate.\nUncertain economic conditions, fiscal policy and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the capital markets, which would affect the discount rate assumptions, terminal value estimates, and transaction premiums. Such uncertain economic conditions could also have an adverse effect on the fundamentals of our business and results of operations, which would affect our internal forecasts about future performance and terminal value estimates. Furthermore, such uncertain economic conditions could have a negative impact on the industry in general. In addition, the risk factors that we have identified in this Form 10-K and will identify from time to time in our reports could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance, terminal value estimates and transaction premiums. There can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for the purpose of estimating grant date fair value of stock options will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.\nCosts to produce were approximately $0.14 per gram of dry flower equivalent for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $0.21 per gram of dry flower equivalent for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in costs to produce is primarily driven by the expansion of our cultivation capacity facilities in Colombia and the resulting economies of scale.\nThe GACP certification attests that we operate under the guidelines that ensure high quality production and products, according to WHO and European Medicine Agency Guidelines (\"EMA\"), on good agricultural and collection practices for (i) medicinal plants under WHO and (ii) starting materials of herbal origin under EMA. Our operations in Colombia were granted such certification on May 27, 2020, with an inclusion of land on November 9, 2020, which means that all greenhouses operate under GACP.\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nIn August 2020, we received a license from INFARMED to cultivate, import and export dried cannabis flower produced at our Portuguese cultivation site and, similar to other licensed cannabis companies in Portugal, we are listed as of August 2020 on INFARMED's Licensing Department's registry. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions on INFARMED's ability to conduct a physical inspection of our Portuguese operation, the license was issued under a special licensing procedure and requires a confirmatory physical inspection from INFARMED. Our license provides our Portuguese operations the same rights and qualifications as licenses issued under the normal procedures, including the ability to conduct commercial operations. The physical inspection took place on August 27, 2020 and, upon successful completion of the inspection review, we expect our current license to be replaced with a license issued under the normal procedures. Under the current license granted by INFARMED, our production facility in Portugal is currently cultivating cannabis for commercial purposes. Our Portugal facility received the GACP certificate in March 2021. To maintain the GACP certificate, we must cultivate and operate under GACP guidelines.\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the value or yield of fixed-income investments may decline if interest rates change. Fluctuations in interest rates may impact the level of income and expense recorded on our cash equivalents, 2022 Convertible Notes, Herbal Brands Loan, other loans and borrowings and the market value of all interest-earning assets, other than those which possess a short term to maturity. A 1% change in the interest rate in effect on December 31, 2020 would not have a material effect on (i) fair value of our cash equivalents as the majority of the portfolio have a maturity date of three-months or less, or (ii) interest income as interest income is not a significant component of Clever Leaves' earnings and cash flow. In addition, the 2022 Convertible Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 8% and are not publicly traded. Therefore, fair value of the 2022 Convertible Notes and interest expense is not materially affected by changes in the market interest rates. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, for hedging or speculative purposes.\nRevenue increased to $12,117 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $7,834 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was driven primarily by the additional months of sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 from the Herbal Brands business which was acquired in April 2019, as well as the sales in our Cannabinoid segment.\nCash flows from operating activities\nRevenue by Channel\n\u2022The transaction involved other considerations, specifically a financing for Clever Leaves;\nIn the normal course of business, we receive inquiries or become involved in legal disputes regarding various litigation matters. In the opinion of management, as of December 31, 2020 any potential liabilities resulting from claims we have received would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nCost of sales decreased to $4,704 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $4,732 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The slight decrease in 2020 is primarily due to the inclusion in 2019 of additional costs related to the fair value of Herbal Brands inventory following the Herbal Brands acquisition. This was mostly offset by sales of Herbal Brands products, which included an additional four months of sales in 2020, as well as the costs of sales from our Cannabinoid segment sales.\nOperating Results by Business Segment\nHerbal Brands Loan Amendment\nConcurrently with the execution of the Herbal Brands Loan, Clever Leaves issued warrants to the Lender to purchase 193,402 Class C preferred shares of Clever Leaves on a 1:1 basis, at a price of $8.79 per share. The warrants can be exercised in whole or in part at any time prior to the expiration date of May 3, 2021, and are not assignable, transferable, or negotiable. Following the closing of the Business Combination, the warrants issued to the Lender remained outstanding but entitle the Lender to purchase common shares of the Company rather than common shares of Clever Leaves.\nOn June 23, 2020, GNC and its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief pursuant to Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code\u201d) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In September 2020, a bankruptcy court judge approved the sale of GNC to an investor and in the third quarter of 2020, substantially all of the assets of GNC were sold to Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holding Corp. Ltd., and GNC emerged from Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. For more information on the potential impact of GNC on our business, refer to Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business - We currently depend on a limited set of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue. If we fail to retain or expand our customer relationships or if one or more significant customers were to terminate their relationship with us or reduce their purchases, or, our revenue could decline significantly\u201d, as well as Note 9. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been disruptions in supply chains, including the impact on international flights and air-cargo restrictions that has limited the shipping of our products from Colombia to other countries. Since July 10, 2020, international flights from Colombia have resumed on a limited basis and with certain restrictions. In addition, there have been disruptions to our planned expansion of certain product line and production processes. The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected the completion of licensing in Portugal due to INFARMED's impaired ability to conduct physical inspections of our facilities. For more information on the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, refer to Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has caused severe disruptions in the global economy and to our business, and may have an adverse impact on our performance and results of operations.\u201d\nIn April and July 2020, Clever Leaves completed the Series E round of financing (the Series E Financing\u201d) and issued an aggregate of approximately $18,396 of senior convertible Class D preferred shares (the Class D preferred shares\u201d) and $4,162 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Debentures due 2023 (the June 2023 Convertible Debentures\u201d). The Class D preferred shares and the June 2023 Convertible Debentures were converted into Clever Leaves common shares and then into common shares of the Company as part of the Arrangement. For additional details see - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt - Series E Financing\u201d and Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nRevenue\n(b)Costs to produce - includes costs associated with cultivation, extraction, depreciation, quality assurance and supply chain related to kilograms (dry flower) harvested.\n\nOn November 9, 2020, Clever Leaves issued to Neem Holdings, a shareholder of Clever Leaves, a warrant (the Neem Holdings Warrants\u201d) to purchase the number of Clever Leaves common shares (the Warrant Shares\u201d) that would entitle Neem Holdings to receive 300,000 common shares in the Arrangement for an aggregate purchase price of $3. The Neem Holdings Warrants are exercisable for all, but not less than all, of the Warrant Shares and expire at the earlier of (i) the date and time that the Business Combination Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; and (ii) the Arrangement Effective Time. The Neem Holdings Warrants were exercised prior to the Arrangement Effective Time.\n \nLoss on investments. Loss on investment was $464 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a loss of $756 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The loss on investments was primarily related to the decline in the carrying value of our investments in Lift & Co. shares and Cansativa. For more information refer to Note 7. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nWe believe our focus on the production of proprietary and exclusive products or formulations that comply with stringent regulations, or that result in enhanced benefits for patients or consumers, could create advantages in various markets.\n\u2022Time to liquidity event; and\nGoodwill impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a goodwill impairment of $1,682 related to our Herbal Brands business. For more information, see Note 8. and Note 10. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Statements of Net Loss Data\nIn October 2020, Clever Leaves completed a financing, pursuant to which it issued $1,230 aggregate principal amount of September 2023 Convertible Debentures. In addition, on November 9, 2020, certain Subscribers in the SAMA PIPE signed subscription agreements with Clever Leaves to invest $1,500 in the aggregate in additional September 2023 Convertible Debentures as part of the Convertible Debenture Investment. All September 2023 Convertible Debentures were converted into Clever Leaves common shares and then into common shares of the Company as part of the Arrangement. For additional details see - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt - 2020 Fourth Quarter Debenture Financing.\u201d and Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nClass D preferred shares voted together with the Clever Leaves common shares, and were not considered a separate class for voting purposes, except as required by law or in cases of dissolution, liquidation, windup or bankruptcy proceedings which require the consent of a majority of Class D preferred shareholders. The Class D preferred shares carried a liquidation preference (the Class D Liquidation Preference\u201d) of 1.4 times the original issue price of $11.00 for the one-year period following the original issue date, increasing by 0.02 times quarterly to a maximum of 1.75 times the original issue price, in each case subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The Class D Liquidation Preference is payable on a liquidation or merger with, reverse takeover of, or other business combination with, a public company, provided that such transaction does not provide for the conversion of Class D preferred shares into Clever Leaves common shares, or certain other deemed liquidation events (the Class D Liquidation Event\u201d). The Business Combination did not constitute a Class D Liquidation Event. The Class D preferred shares were not redeemable but were convertible at any time, at the option of the holders, into Clever Leaves common shares on a 1:1 basis, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. Automatic conversion into Clever Leaves common shares would occur at the applicable conversion price which takes into account the Class D Liquidation Preference in the event of (1) the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Class D preferred shares consenting to such conversion, (2) an initial public offering or direct listing of Clever Leaves common shares on Nasdaq, NYSE or TSX, or (3) completion of a merger with, reverse takeover of or other business combination with a public company, provided that such transaction provides for the conversion of Class D\n \nOur business model is focused on partnering with leading and emerging cannabis businesses by providing them with lower cost product, variable cost structures, reliable supply throughout the year, and accelerated speed to market. This is achievable due to our production locations, capacity, product registrations and various product certifications. To date, we have had limited export shipments of our cannabis products to Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru, Poland, Spain, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nWe harvested 56,685 kilograms of cannabinoids in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 39,720 kilograms in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the expansion of our cultivation facilities in Colombia.\nWe manage our business in two segments: the Cannabinoid and Non-Cannabinoid segments.\nIn October 2018, as part of the Series C financing, Clever Leaves issued $17,890 aggregate principal amount of noninterest bearing unsecured convertible debentures due 2021 (the 2021 Convertible Debentures\u201d). The 2021 Convertible Debentures had a maturity date of September 30, 2021. All of the 2021 Convertible Debentures were converted into an aggregate of 2,546,670 of Class C preferred shares in March 2019.\nCannabinoid - Cannabinoid segment loss decreased to $18,798 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $25,250 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to cost control measures implemented by us in 2020, as well as increased sales of cannabinoid products. The decrease was partly offset by costs incurred on the expansion of our operations in Colombia, Portugal and Germany.\nLoss on debt extinguishment. Loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2,360 and related primarily to the conversion of the Series E Debentures and the September 2023 Convertible Debentures at the closing of the Business Combination. Loss on debt extinguishment of $3,374 for year ended December 31, 2019 was due to the conversion of our Series C debt of Clever Leaves in March 2019 into Class C preferred shares that were subsequently exchanged for common shares of the Company at the closing of the Business Combination. For more information, see Note 12. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nIn April 2019, to facilitate the financing the Herbal Brands acquisition, Herbal Brands entered into the Herbal Brands Loan with, and issued warrants to, a third-party lender, Rock Cliff Capital LLC ( Lender\u201d). The Herbal Brands Loan was amended in August 2020. For further details on the Herbal Brands acquisition, see Note 8. to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Form 10-K.\nSources of Liquidity\nWe did not have off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented, other than the obligations discussed above.\npayments already paid (excluding PIK interest paid and PIK interest capitalized as outstanding principal) on such prepayment date.
