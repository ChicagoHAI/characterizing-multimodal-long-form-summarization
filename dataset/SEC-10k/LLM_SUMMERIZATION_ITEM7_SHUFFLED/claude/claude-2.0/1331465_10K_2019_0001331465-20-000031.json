Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis relates to the Bank's financial condition as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. This section explains the changes in certain key items in the Bank's financial statements from year to year, the primary factors driving those changes, the Bank's risk management processes and results, known trends or uncertainties that the Bank believes may have a material effect on the Bank's future performance, as well as how certain accounting principles affect the Bank's financial statements. For a discussion on the comparison between the results of operations for the years ended 2018 and 2017, see the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which are contained in the Bank's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 7, 2019.\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the Bank's audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2019 included in Item 8 of this Report. Readers also should carefully review Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a description of the forward-looking statements in this Report and a discussion of the factors that might cause the Bank's actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from these forward-looking statements.\nExecutive Summary\nFinancial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2019, total assets were $149.9 billion, a decrease of $4.6 billion, or 2.99 percent, from December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to an $11.3 billion, or 10.4 percent, decrease in advances which was due to maturities that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2019 and a decrease in members' liquidity needs. The decrease was partially offset by a $6.3 billion, or 14.2 percent, increase in total investments.\nAs of December 31, 2019, total liabilities were $142.7 billion, a decrease of $4.1 billion, or 2.82 percent, from December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a $4.5 billion, or 3.10 percent, decrease in consolidated obligations as a result of lower advances balances as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, total capital was $7.2 billion, a decrease of $484 million, or 6.33 percent, from December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the Bank's subclass B2 activity-based capital stock resulting from a decrease in the total outstanding advances during the year.\nResults of Operations\nThe Bank recorded net income of $367 million for 2019, a decrease of $49 million, or 11.9 percent, from net income of $416 million for 2018. Net interest income attributed $26 million of this decrease. Net interest income was $535 million for 2019, compared to $561 million for 2018.\nThe decreases in net income and net interest income were primarily related to a decrease in outstanding advances during 2019, compared to 2018. Additionally, changes in interest rates and their subsequent impact on the Bank's derivative positions, interest-earning assets, and interest bearing liabilities contributed to the decrease in net income and net interest income during 2019. These changes in interest rates impacted interest expense related to interest-bearing liabilities more than the offsetting interest income related to interest-earning assets. The impact of derivatives and hedging activities was a reduction to net interest income of $31 million in 2019. Beginning on January 1, 2019, changes in fair value of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk for designated fair value hedges are recorded in net interest income in the same line as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Prior to January 1, 2019, for fair value hedges, any hedge ineffectiveness (which represented the amount by which the change in the fair value of the derivative differed from the change in the fair value of the hedge item) was recorded in noninterest income as net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities.\nOne way in which the Bank analyzes its performance is by comparing its annualized return on equity (ROE) to three-month average LIBOR. The Bank has chosen to measure ROE as a spread to average three-month LIBOR because the Bank has significant assets and liabilities priced to average three-month LIBOR. The Bank's ROE was 5.09 percent for 2019, compared to 5.54 percent for 2018. This decrease in ROE was primarily due to the decrease in net income during the year. ROE spread to average three-month LIBOR was 276 basis points for 2019, compared to 323 basis points for 2018. This decrease in the ROE spread to three-month average LIBOR was primarily due to the decrease in ROE.\nThe Bank's interest-rate spread was 25 basis points for 2019, compared to 28 basis points for 2018. This decrease in the Bank's interest-rate spread was primarily due to changes in interest rates as discussed above, which impacted interest expense related to interest-bearing liabilities more than the offsetting interest income related to interest-earning assets. Decreased advances balances in 2019, compared to 2018, also contributed to the decrease.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe Bank's business model continues to be focused on enhancing the total value of the cooperative for its members by serving as their trusted advisor. The Bank focuses these efforts on offering readily available, competitively priced advances, a potential return on investment, support for community investment activities, and other credit and noncredit products and services. As part of the Bank's cooperative structure, the Bank has chosen to operate with narrow margins, passing on its low funding costs to members, which causes the Bank's profitability to be sensitive to changes in market conditions.\nThe state of the economy is a significant component in determining the Bank's overall business outlook as it impacts advance demand, asset and collateral values, member financial stability, funding costs, and many other facets of the Bank's portfolio. While the U.S. economy continued to experience growth in 2019, factors such as interest rates, liquidity levels at member institutions, fiscal and monetary policies, performance of global economies, and regulatory changes could have a significant effect either positive or negative on the Bank's financial performance.\nInterest rates are also a significant factor on the Bank's business outlook. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates during 2017 and 2018, and then lowered interest rates during 2019. There is uncertainty as to whether rates in 2020 will move up, down, or remain stable. This uncertainty can impact the Bank's interest rate risk management, profitability, and ROE. It can also impact member advance demand, as rate uncertainty can impact deposit levels at members.\nMerger activity involving the Bank's members can impact the Bank's business outlook. As the financial industry continues to experience consolidation, our membership base may decrease, and our advance balance and other business could increase or decrease significantly depending upon the size of the financial institutions involved in the merger. While the Bank's balance sheet is designed to expand and contract based upon advance demand, the Bank's business could be affected by this merger activity, including as a result of a single event, such as the loss of a member's business due to acquisition by a non-member.\nManagement continues to be focused and engaged on implementing an effective transition away from LIBOR. Many of the Bank's assets and liabilities are indexed to LIBOR, and many of the Bank's derivative transactions are also indexed to LIBOR. In 2019, the Bank began engaging in Overnight Index Swap (OIS) and SOFR-based derivative transactions. There are complexities, risks and uncertainties involved with transitioning to alternative rates, and the transition involves considerable time and resources, all of which can impact the Bank's business outlook.\nFinancial Condition\nThe following table presents the distribution of the Bank's total assets, liabilities, and capital by major class as of the dates indicated (dollars in millions).

decreased by 10.4 percent, compared to December 31, 2018. As a result of shareholder demand, the majority of new advances in 2019 were short-term advances. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, 64.6 percent and 59.6 percent, respectively, of the Bank's advances were fixed rate. However, the Bank often simultaneously entered into derivatives with the issuance of advances to convert the rates, in effect, into short-term variable interest rates, the majority of which were based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, 46.7 percent and 45.3 percent, respectively, of the Bank's fixed-rate advances were swapped, and 2.03 percent and 0.47 percent, respectively, of the Bank's variable-rate advances, which contained optionality, were swapped. The majority of the Bank's variable-rate advances were indexed to LIBOR. By March 31, 2020, the Bank will cease issuing LIBOR-based advances and entering into LIBOR-based derivatives with maturities/termination dates beyond December 31, 2021. The Bank also offers variable-rate advances that may be tied to indices such as the federal funds rate, prime rate, SOFR, or constant maturity swap rates.\nThe Bank's 10 largest borrowing member institutions had 74.4 percent of the Bank's total advances outstanding as of December 31, 2019. Further information regarding the Bank's 10 largest borrowing member institutions and breakdown of their individual advance balances as of December 31, 2019 is contained in Item 1, Business-Credit Products-Advances. Management believes that the Bank holds sufficient collateral, on a member-specific basis, to secure the advances to all borrowers, including these 10 institutions, and the Bank does not expect to incur any credit losses on these advances.\nSupplementary financial data on the Bank's advances is set forth under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information (Unaudited).\nInvestments\nThe following table presents more detailed information regarding investments held by the Bank (dollars in millions).\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment securities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government-sponsored enterprises debt obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.

The decrease in interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to a change in interpretation of regulatory guidance related to unsecured credit exposure.\nThe Finance Agency regulations prohibit an FHLBank from purchasing MBS and asset-backed securities if its investment in such securities would exceed 300 percent of the FHLBank's previous month-end regulatory capital on the day it would\npurchase the securities. As of December 31, 2019, these investments were 309 percent of the Bank's regulatory capital. These investments exceeded the 300 percent level due to a decrease in regulatory capital that resulted from a decrease in advances. The Bank was in compliance with this regulatory requirement at the time of its MBS purchases and will not be required to sell any previously purchased MBS. However, the Bank was precluded from purchasing additional MBS until its MBS to regulatory capital declines below 300 percent. As of December 31, 2018, the Banks MBS to regulatory capital was 290 percent of regulatory capital.\nRefer to Note 6-Available-for-sale Securities and Note 7-Held-to-maturity Securities to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements for information on securities with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe Bank evaluates its individual investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, as described in Note 8-Other-than-temporary Impairment to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements.\nMortgage Loans Held for Portfolio\nThe decrease in mortgage loans held for portfolio from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the maturity and prepayments of these assets during the year.\nMembers that sold mortgage loans to the Bank were located primarily in the southeastern United States; therefore the Bank's conventional mortgage loan portfolio was concentrated in that region as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The following table presents the percentage of unpaid principal balance of conventional residential mortgage loans held for portfolio for the five largest state concentrations.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Florida\n</td> <td>22.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South Carolina\n</td> <td>20.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Virginia\n</td> <td>11.61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Georgia\n</td> <td>9.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North Carolina\n</td> <td>8.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other\n</td> <td>27.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSupplementary financial data on the Bank's mortgage loans is set forth under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Supplementary Financial Information (Unaudited).\nConsolidated Obligations\nThe Bank funds its assets primarily through the issuance of consolidated obligation bonds and consolidated obligation discount notes. The decrease in consolidated obligations from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 was primarily a result of the decrease in advances outstanding during the year. Consolidated obligation issuances financed 93.9 percent of the $149.9 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2019, remaining relatively stable compared to the financing ratio of 94.0 percent as of December 31, 2018.\nConsolidated obligations outstanding were primarily variable rate as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Bank often simultaneously entered into derivatives with the issuance of consolidated obligation bonds to convert the interest rates, in effect, into short-term variable interest rates, which were usually based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, 83.3 percent and 80.7 percent, respectively, of the Bank's fixed-rate consolidated obligation bonds were swapped. None of the Bank's variable-rate consolidated obligation bonds were swapped as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2019, 33.9 percent of the Bank's fixed-rate consolidated obligation discount notes were swapped and none of the Bank's fixed-rate consolidated obligation discount notes were swapped as of December 31, 2018. By March 31, 2020, the Bank will cease entering into LIBOR-based derivatives with termination dates beyond December 31, 2021.\nSupplementary financial data on the Bank's short-term borrowings is set forth under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Supplementary Financial Information (Unaudited).\nDeposits\nThe Bank offers demand and overnight deposit programs to members and qualifying non-members primarily as a liquidity management service. In addition, a member that services mortgage loans may deposit funds in the Bank that are collected in connection with the mortgage loans, pending disbursement of those funds to the owners of the mortgage loans. For demand deposits, the Bank pays interest at the overnight rate. Most of these deposits represent member liquidity investments, which members may withdraw on demand. Therefore, the total account balance of the Bank's deposits may fluctuate significantly. As a matter of prudence, the Bank typically invests deposit funds in liquid short-term assets. Member loan demand, deposit flows, and liquidity management strategies influence the amount and volatility of deposit balances carried with the Bank.\nCapital\nThe FHLBank Act and Finance Agency regulations specify that each FHLBank must meet certain minimum regulatory capital standards. The Bank must maintain (1) total regulatory capital in an amount equal to at least four percent of its total assets; (2) leverage capital in an amount equal to at least five percent of its total assets; and (3) permanent capital in an amount equal to at least its regulatory risk-based capital requirement. Permanent capital is defined by the FHLBank Act and applicable regulations as the sum of paid-in capital for Class B stock and retained earnings. Mandatorily redeemable capital stock is considered capital for regulatory purposes. These regulatory capital requirements, and the Bank's compliance with these requirements, are presented in detail in Note 14-Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements.\nFinance Agency regulations establish criteria for four capital classifications, based on the amount and type of capital held by an FHLBank, as follows:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adequately Capitalized - FHLBank meets or exceeds both risk-based and minimum capital requirements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Undercapitalized - FHLBank does not meet one or both of its risk-based or minimum capital requirements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significantly Undercapitalized - FHLBank has less than 75 percent of one or both of its risk-based or minimum capital requirements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Critically Undercapitalized - FHLBank total capital is two percent or less of total assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Under the regulations, the Director of the Finance Agency (Director) will make a capital classification for each FHLBank at least quarterly and notify the FHLBank in writing of any proposed action and provide an opportunity for the FHLBank to submit information relevant to such action. The Director is permitted to make discretionary classifications. An FHLBank must provide written notice to the Finance Agency within 10 days of any event or development that has caused or is likely to cause its permanent or total capital to fall below the level required to maintain its most recent capital classification or reclassification. In the event that an FHLBank is not adequately capitalized, the regulations delineate the types of prompt corrective actions that the Director may order, including submission of a capital restoration plan by the FHLBank and restrictions on its dividends, stock redemptions, executive compensation, new business activities, or any other actions the Director determines will ensure safe and sound operations and capital compliance by the FHLBank. On December 13, 2019, the Bank received notification from the Director that, based on September 30, 2019 data, the Bank meets the definition of adequately capitalized.\u201d\nAll of the FHLBanks entered into a Capital Agreement, which is intended to enhance the capital position of each FHLBank. Under the Capital Agreement, each FHLBank allocates 20 percent of its net income each quarter to a separate restricted retained earnings account until the account balance equals at least one percent of the FHLBank's average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the previous quarter. Restricted retained earnings are not available to pay dividends and are presented separately on the Statements of Condition.\nFinance Agency regulations require the Bank to perform annual stress tests under various scenarios and publicly disclose a summary of the stress test results for the severely adverse scenario. The Bank filed the results of its stress test with the Finance Agency on August 27, 2019, and publicly disclosed a summary of the adverse scenario results on November 15, 2019.\nUnder the Bank's financial management policy, the Bank targets to maintain (1) a capital-to-assets ratio of 4.50 percent to 5.00 percent; (2) a retained earnings account balance equal to the restricted retained earnings account balance, plus extremely stressed scenario losses; and (3) unrestricted retained earnings greater than the retained earnings target. The Bank believes that daily excess stock repurchases and consistent dividends give members greater certainty of a return of their principal or the receipt of a dividend, which in turn may have a positive impact on members' appetite for advances. The Bank seeks to pay an amount of dividends each quarter that are consistent with an attractive rate of return on capital to its member shareholders\nrelative to an established benchmark, LIBOR, after providing for retained earnings as discussed above. Historically, the Bank's dividend rate has increased with increases in LIBOR, while the spread between the dividend rate and LIBOR may shrink. Conversely, the dividend rate may decrease during periods of lower LIBOR, while the spread may increase. The Bank's ability to maintain dividends consistent with its recent trend depends on LIBOR remaining relatively stable, the Bank's actual financial performance, its ability to maintain adequate retained earnings, other factors described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and the discretion of the Bank's board of directors. Information about dividends paid by the Bank during 2019, 2018, and 2017, is contained in Note 14-Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of the Bank's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nNet Income\nThe following table presents the Bank's significant income items for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, and provides information regarding the changes during those years (dollars in millions).

Net interest income equals interest earned on assets (including member advances, mortgage loans, MBS held in portfolio, and other investments), less the interest expense incurred on liabilities (including consolidated obligations, deposits, and other borrowings). Also included in net interest income are miscellaneous related items such as prepayment fees, the amortization of debt issuance discounts, concession fees, and certain derivative instruments and hedging activities related adjustments. The Bank also recognizes significant improvements in expected cash flows related to other-than-temporary impairment securities through net interest income as an adjustment to the yield on the investment securities.\nAs discussed above, net interest income includes components of hedging activity. When hedging relationships qualify for hedge accounting, the interest components of the hedging derivatives will be reflected in interest income or expense. Beginning on January 1, 2019, the fair value gains and losses of derivatives and hedged items designated in fair value hedge relationships are also recognized in interest income or interest expense. Prior to January 1, 2019, the portion of fair value gains and losses of derivatives and hedged items representing hedge ineffectiveness were recorded in noninterest income. When a hedging relationship is discontinued, the cumulative fair value adjustment on the hedged item will be amortized into interest income or expense over the remaining life of the asset or liability. The impact of hedging on net interest income was a decrease of $31 million and $91 million, during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe decrease in net interest income during 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in outstanding advances during 2019 compared to 2018. Additionally, changes in interest rates and their subsequent impact on the Bank's derivative positions, interest-earning assets, and interest-bearing liabilities contributed to the decrease in net interest income. These changes in interest rates impacted interest expense related to interest-bearing liabilities more that the offsetting interest income related to interest-earning assets.\nThe increase in net interest income during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to increased prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances during 2017. These prepayments resulted in $307 million of accelerated amortization during 2017. This accelerated amortization reduced net interest income and was offset by a corresponding increase in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities, reflected in noninterest income. The 2017 prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances primarily relate to a single member institution. The remaining change in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in interest rates, which impacted interest-earning assets more than the offsetting increase in consolidated obligation expense.\nThe following table presents key components of net interest income for the years presented (in millions): Table 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Advances\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>817\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Investments\n</td> <td>1,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>677\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Mortgage loans\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest income\n</td> <td>3,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Consolidated obligations\n</td> <td>3,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Interest-bearing deposits\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest expense\n</td> <td>3,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents spreads between the average yield on total interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (dollars in millions). The interest-rate spread is affected by the inclusion or exclusion of net interest income or expense associated with the Bank's derivatives. If the derivatives do not qualify for fair-value hedge accounting under GAAP, the interest income or expense associated with the derivatives is excluded from net interest income and from the calculation of interest-rate spread and is recorded in Noninterest income (loss) as Net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities.\u201d Amortization associated with some hedging-related basis adjustments is also reflected in net interest income, which affects interest-rate spread.\nThe Bank's interest-rate spread was 25 basis points, 28 basis points, and seven basis points for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The decrease in interest-rate spread during 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily due to changes in interest rates that impacted interest expense related to interest-bearing liabilities more than the offsetting interest income related to interest-earning assets. Decreased advances balances in 2019, compared to 2018, also contributed to the decrease. The increase in interest-rate spread during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to the increased prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances during 2017 as previously discussed, which decreased net interest income during 2017.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Prior period amounts do not conform to new hedge accounting guidance adopted January 1, 2019.\nBeginning on January 1, 2019, changes in fair value of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk for designated fair value hedges are recorded in net interest income in the same line as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Prior to January 1, 2019, for fair value hedges, any hedge ineffectiveness (which represented the amount by which the change in the fair value of the derivative differed from the change in the fair value of the hedge item) was recorded in noninterest income as net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities.\nThe decrease in total noninterest income during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to increased prepayments of restructured and redesignated advances during 2017, which resulted in $307 million of accelerated amortization during 2017. This accelerated amortization reduced net interest income during 2017 and was offset by a corresponding increase in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities. The remaining changes in derivatives and hedging activities were primarily related to changes in interest rates.\nThe following tables present the net effect of derivatives and hedging activity on the Bank's results of operations (in millions):\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Many members rely on the Bank as a source of standby liquidity, so the Bank attempts to be in a position to meet member funding needs on a timely basis. The Bank is required to maintain liquidity in accordance with the FHLBank Act, Finance Agency regulations, and policies established by the Bank's management and board of directors. In addition, the Finance Agency, at times, has issued guidance and expectations to the FHLBanks related to liquidity.\nLiquidity Reserves for Deposits. Finance Agency regulations require the Bank to hold a total amount of cash, obligations of the U.S., and advances with maturities of less than five years, in an amount not less than the amount of total member deposits. The Bank has complied with this requirement throughout 2019.\nOperational Liquidity. In order to ensure adequate operational liquidity (generally, the ready cash and borrowing capacity available to meet the Bank's intraday needs) each day, Bank policy establishes a daily liquidity target based upon member deposit levels and current day liability maturities and asset settlements. The Bank met this liquidity requirement throughout 2019.\nContingent Liquidity. Finance Agency regulations require the Bank to maintain contingent liquidity in an amount sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for five business days if it is unable to access the capital markets. The Bank met these regulatory liquidity requirements throughout 2019.\nAdditional Liquidity Guidance. On August 23, 2018, the Finance Agency issued a final Advisory Bulletin on FHLBank liquidity (Liquidity Guidance AB) that communicates the Finance Agency's expectations with respect to the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to enable the Bank to provide advances and standby letters of credit for members during a sustained capital market disruption, assuming no access to capital markets and assuming renewal of all maturing advances for a period of between ten to thirty calendar days. Contemporaneously with the issuance of the Liquidity Guidance AB, the Finance Agency issued a supervisory letter that identifies initial thresholds for measures of liquidity within the established ranges set forth in the Liquidity Guidance AB.\nThe Liquidity Guidance AB's measurements of liquidity include a cash flow scenario, on a daily basis, that projects forward the number of days for which the Bank should maintain positive cash balances assuming the renewal of all maturing advances and the maintenance of a liquidity reserve for outstanding standby letters of credit. The measurements of liquidity also include a funding gap measurement of the difference between assets and liabilities that are scheduled to mature during a specified period, expressed as a percentage of the Bank's total assets to reduce the liquidity risks associated with a mismatch in asset and liability maturities, including an undue reliance on short-term debt funding, which may increase debt rollover risk.\nPortions of the Liquidity Guidance AB were implemented on December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, with full implementation to take place on December 31, 2019. The Bank has increased the amount of liquid assets it holds to meet the December 31, 2019 implementation date of this guidance.\nSources of Liquidity. The Bank's principal source of liquidity is consolidated obligation debt instruments. To provide additional liquidity, the Bank also may use other short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and loans from other FHLBanks. The Bank's consolidated obligations are not obligations of the United States and are not guaranteed by either the United States or any government agency, but have historically received the same credit rating as the government bond credit rating of the United States. As a result, the Bank generally has comparatively stable access to funding through a diverse investor base at relatively favorable spreads to U.S. Treasury rates. The Bank's income and liquidity would be adversely affected if it were not able to access the capital markets at competitive rates for an extended period.\nThe Bank maintained continual access to funding and adapted its debt issuance to meet the needs of its members throughout 2019. The Bank's short-term funding was generally driven by member demand and was achieved through the issuance of consolidated discount notes and short-term consolidated bonds throughout 2019. Access to short-term debt markets has been reliable because investors, driven by increased liquidity preferences and risk aversion, including the effects of money market fund reform, have sought the Bank's short-term debt as an asset of choice, which has led to advantageous funding opportunities and increased utilization of debt maturing in one year or less.\nThe Bank is focused on maintaining an adequate liquidity balance and a funding balance between its financial assets and financial liabilities and the FHLBanks work collectively to manage the system-wide liquidity and funding needs. Management and the FHLBanks jointly monitor the combined refinancing risk primarily by tracking the maturities of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Bank monitors the funding balance between financial assets and financial liabilities and is committed to prudent risk management practices. In managing and monitoring the amounts of assets that require refunding, the Bank considers contractual maturities of its financial assets, as well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e. estimated prepayments and scheduled amortizations). External factors including Bank member borrowing needs, supply and demand in the debt markets, and other factors may also affect the liquidity balances and the funding balance between financial assets and financial liabilities. See the notes to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements for more information regarding contractual maturities of certain of the Bank's financial assets and liabilities.\nContingency plans are in place that prioritize the allocation of liquidity resources in the event of operational disruptions at the Bank or the Office of Finance. Under the FHLBank Act, the Secretary of Treasury has the authority, at his discretion, to purchase consolidated obligations up to an aggregate amount of $4.0 billion. No borrowings under this authority have been outstanding since 1977.\nOff-balance Sheet Commitments\nThe Bank's primary off-balance sheet commitments are as follows:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Bank's joint and several liability for all FHLBank consolidated obligations; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the Bank's outstanding commitments arising from standby letters of credit.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Should an FHLBank be unable to satisfy its payment obligation under a consolidated obligation for which it is the primary obligor, any of the other FHLBanks, including the Bank, could be called upon to repay all or any part of such payment obligation, as determined or approved by the Finance Agency. As of December 31, 2019, none of the other FHLBanks defaulted on their consolidated obligations; the Finance Agency was not required to allocate any obligation among the FHLBanks; and no amount of the joint and several obligation was fixed. Accordingly, the Bank has not recognized a liability for its joint and several obligations related to other FHLBanks' consolidated obligations as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the FHLBanks had $1.0 trillion in aggregate par value of consolidated obligations issued and outstanding, $140.8 billion of which was attributable to the Bank. No FHLBank has ever defaulted on its principal or interest payments under any consolidated obligation, and the Bank has never been required to make payments under any consolidated obligation as a result of the failure of another FHLBank to meet its obligations.\nThe Bank generally requires standby letters of credit to contain language permitting the Bank, upon annual renewal dates and prior notice to the beneficiary, to choose not to renew the standby letter of credit, which effectively terminates the standby letter of credit prior to its scheduled final expiration date. Based on the creditworthiness of the member applicant and appropriate additional fees, the Bank may issue standby letters of credit that have terms of longer than one year without annual renewals or that have no stated maturity and are subject to renewal on an annual basis.\nCommitments to extend credit, including standby letters of credit, are agreements to lend. The Bank issues a standby letter of credit on behalf of a member in exchange for a fee. A member may use these standby letters of credit to facilitate a financing arrangement. Management regularly reviews its standby letter of credit pricing in light of several factors, including the Bank's potential liquidity needs related to draws on its standby letters of credit. Based on management's credit analyses and collateral requirements, the Bank does not deem it necessary to have an allowance for credit losses for these unfunded standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2019.\nRefer to Note 19-Commitments and Contingencies to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements for more information about the Bank's outstanding standby letters of credit.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents the payment due dates or expiration terms of the Bank's long-term contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019 (in millions).\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>One year or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After one year\nthrough three years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After three years\nthrough five years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After five years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated obligations bonds(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and post-retirement contributions(2)\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mandatorily redeemable capital stock\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\n(1) Does not include discount notes and contractual interest payments related to bonds.

Several of the Bank's accounting policies are inherently subject to valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments and are more critical than others to the Bank's results. The Bank considers fair value measurements and derivatives and hedging activities to be critical accounting policies because they require management's subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its judgments and estimates on current market conditions and industry practices, historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and/or conditions.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Bank carries certain assets and liabilities, including investments classified as trading and available-for-sale and all derivatives, on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, representing an exit price.\nFair values play an important role in the valuation of certain assets, liabilities, and hedging transactions of the Bank. Fair values are based on quoted market prices or market-based prices, if such prices are available, even in situations in which trading volume may be low when compared with prior periods. If quoted market prices or market-based prices are not available, the Bank determines fair values based on valuation models that use discounted cash flows, using market estimates of interest rates and volatility.\nValuation models and their underlying assumptions are based on the best estimates of the Bank's management with respect to:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>market indices (primarily LIBOR and the OIS curve);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>discount rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>prepayments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>market volatility; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other factors, including default and loss rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese assumptions, particularly estimates of market indices and discount rates, may have a significant effect on the reported fair values of assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and the income and expense related thereto. The use of different assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could result in a materially different net income and retained earnings. The assumptions used in the models are corroborated by and independently verified against market observable data where possible.\nThe Bank categorizes its financial instruments carried at fair value into a three-level classification in accordance with GAAP. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency (observable or unobservable) of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Bank's market assumptions. The Bank utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nRefer to Note 18-Estimated Fair Values to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements for further discussion regarding how the Bank measures financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nGeneral\nThe Bank records all derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in current-period earnings. The Bank designates derivatives as either fair-value hedging instruments or non-qualifying hedging instruments for which hedge accounting is not applied. The Bank has not entered into any cash-flow hedges as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Bank uses derivatives in its risk management program for the following purposes:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>conversion of a fixed rate to a variable rate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>conversion of a variable rate with a fixed component to another variable rate; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>macro hedging of balance sheet risks.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the Bank documents the following concurrently with the execution of each hedging relationship:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the hedging strategy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged item;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>determination of the appropriate accounting designation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the method used for the determination of effectiveness for transactions qualifying for hedge accounting; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the method for recording ineffectiveness for hedging relationships.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank also evaluates each debt issuance, advance made, and financial instrument purchased to determine whether the cash item contains embedded derivatives that meet the criteria for bifurcation. If, after evaluation, it is determined that an embedded derivative must be bifurcated, the Bank will measure the fair value of the embedded derivative.\nAssessment of Hedge Effectiveness\nAn assessment must be made to determine the effectiveness of qualifying hedging relationships. To make such an assessment, the Bank either uses (1) the short-cut method; or (2) the long-haul method.\nIf the hedging instrument is a swap and meets specific criteria, the hedging relationship may qualify for the short-cut method of assessing effectiveness. The short-cut method allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness, which means that the change in the fair value of the hedged item is assumed to be equal and offsetting to the change in fair value of the hedging instrument. For periods beginning after May 31, 2005, the Bank determined that it would no longer apply the short-cut method to new hedging relationships.\nThe long-haul method of effectiveness is used to assess effectiveness for hedging relationships that qualify for hedge accounting but do not meet the criteria for the use of the short-cut method. The long-haul method requires separate valuations of both the hedged item and the hedging instrument. If the hedging relationship is determined to be highly effective, the change in fair value of the hedged item related to the designated risk is recognized in current period earnings in the same period as the change in fair value of the hedging instrument. If the hedging relationship is determined not to be highly effective, hedge accounting will either not be allowed or cease at that point. The Bank performs effectiveness testing on a monthly basis and uses statistical regression analysis techniques to determine whether a long-haul hedging relationship is highly effective.\nAccounting for Ineffectiveness and Hedge De-designation\nThe Bank accounts for any ineffectiveness for all long-haul fair-value hedges using the dollar offset method. In the case of non-qualifying hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Bank reports only the change in the fair value of the derivative. Both the net interest on the derivative and the fair value adjustments of a non-qualifying hedge are recorded in noninterest income (loss) as Net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d on the Statements of Income. Beginning January 1, 2019, the Bank adopted new hedge accounting guidance, which, among other things, impacts the presentation of gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities for qualifying hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that are effective as, and that are designated and qualify as, a fair-value hedge, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk (including changes that reflect losses or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in net interest income in the same line as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Prior to January 1, 2019, any hedge ineffectiveness (which represented the amount by which the change in the fair value of the derivative differed from the change in the fair value of the hedged item) was recorded in noninterest income (loss) as Net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d on the Statements of Income.\nThe Bank may discontinue hedge accounting for a hedging transaction (de-designation) if it fails effectiveness testing or for other asset-liability-management reasons. The Bank also treats modifications to hedged items as a discontinuance of a hedging relationship. When a hedging relationship is discontinued, the Bank will cease marking the hedged item to fair value and will amortize the cumulative basis adjustment resulting from hedge accounting. The Bank reports related amortization as interest income or expense over the remaining life of the associated hedged item. The associated derivative will continue to be marked to fair value through earnings until it matures or is terminated.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance\nSee Note 3-Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting guidance.\nLegislative and Regulatory Developments\nThe legislative and regulatory environment in which the Bank and its members operate continues to evolve as a result of regulations enacted pursuant to the Housing Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bank's business operations, funding costs, rights, obligations, and/or the environment in which the Bank carries out its housing finance and community lending mission are likely to continue to be significantly impacted by these changes. Significant regulatory actions and developments for the period covered by this report are summarized below.\nUncertainty Regarding Brexit. In June 2016, the United Kingdom (the UK) voted in favor of leaving the European Union (the EU), and in March 2017, Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty was invoked, commencing a period of negotiations between the UK and the European Council for the UK's withdrawal from the EU, which was subsequently extended by the European Council members in agreement with the UK. On January 31, 2020, the UK withdrew from the EU under the European Union Withdrawal Act 2020, with a transition period to last until December 31, 2020, which period may be extended for an additional two years. During this transition period, the UK and the EU will negotiate the details of their future relationship, including what conditions will apply to EU-based entities that want to do business with the UK, and vice versa, after the transition period.\nFrom time to time the Bank may have exposure to UK-based and EU-based counterparties. At this time it is not possible to predict the date on which the transition period will end or whether any agreement reached between the UK and the EU will have a material adverse effect on the financial instruments governing the contractual terms with these counterparties.\nFinance Agency Proposed Amendments to Stress Test Rule. On December 16, 2019, the Finance Agency published a proposed rule amending its stress testing rule, consistent with section 401 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (EGRRCPA), (i) to raise the minimum threshold to conduct periodic stress tests for entities regulated by the Finance Agency from those with consolidated assets of more than $10 billion to those with consolidated assets of more than $250 billion, (ii) to remove the requirements for FHLBanks to conduct stress tests; and (iii) remove the adverse scenario from the list of required scenarios. The proposed rule maintains the Finance Agency's discretion to require that an FHLBank with total consolidated assets below the $250 billion threshold conduct stress testing. The proposed amendments align the Finance Agency's stress testing rules with rules adopted by other financial institution regulators that implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act stress testing requirements, as amended by the EGRRCPA. The results of the Bank's most recent annual severely adverse economic conditions stress test were published to our public website, www.fhlbatl.com, on November 15, 2019. If the rule is adopted as proposed, it will eliminate these stress testing requirements for FHLBanks, unless the Finance Agency exercises its discretion to require stress testing in the future. The Bank does not expect this rule, if adopted as proposed, to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations.\nFDIC Brokered Deposits Restrictions. On December 12, 2019, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a proposed rule to amend its brokered deposits restrictions that apply to less than well capitalized insured depository institutions. The FDIC states that the proposed amendments are intended to modernize its brokered deposit regulations and would establish a new framework for analyzing whether deposits placed through deposit placement arrangements qualify as brokered deposits. These deposit placement arrangements include those between insured depository institutions and third parties, such as financial technology companies, for a variety of business purposes, including access to deposits. By creating a new framework for analyzing certain provisions of the deposit broker\u201d definition, including shortening the list of activities considered facilitating\u201d and expanding the scope of the primary purpose\u201d exception, the proposed rule would narrow the definition of deposit broker\u201d and exclude more deposits from treatment as brokered deposits.\u201d The proposed rule would also establish an application and reporting process with respect to the primary purpose exception.\nIf this rule is adopted as proposed, the Bank does not expect it to materially affect its financial condition or results of operations. However, if adopted as proposed, the rule could affect the demand for certain of the Bank's advance products, but the extent of the impact is uncertain.\nFinance Agency Supervisory Letter - Planning for LIBOR Phase-Out. On September 27, 2019, the Finance Agency issued a\nSupervisory Letter (Supervisory Letter) to the FHLBanks that the Finance Agency stated is designed to ensure the FHLBanks\nwill be able to identify and prudently manage the risks associated with the termination of LIBOR in a safe and sound manner.\nThe Supervisory Letter provides that the FHLBanks should, by March 31, 2020, cease entering into new LIBOR referenced\nfinancial assets, liabilities, and derivatives with maturities beyond December 31, 2021 for all product types except investments.\nWith respect to investments, the FHLBanks were required, by December 31, 2019, to stop purchasing investments that reference LIBOR and mature after December 31, 2021. These phase-out dates do not apply to collateral accepted by the FHLBanks. The Supervisory Letter also directs the FHLBanks to update their pledged collateral certification reporting requirements by March 31, 2020 in an effort to encourage members to distinguish LIBOR-linked collateral maturing after December 31, 2021.\nAs a result of the Supervisory Letter, beginning April 1, 2020, the Bank will no longer enter into certain structured advances and advances with terms directly linked to LIBOR that mature after December 31, 2021. In addition, beginning April 1, 2020, the Bank will no longer enter into consolidated obligation bonds and derivatives with swaps, caps, or floors indexed to LIBOR that terminate after December 31, 2021. The Bank has ceased purchasing investments that reference LIBOR and mature after December 31, 2021.\nThe Bank continues to evaluate the potential impact of the Supervisory Letter on its financial condition and results of operations, but the Bank has begun to change its investment strategy, may experience lower overall demand or increased costs for its advances, and it may be necessary to change the Bank's hedging strategy, all of which in turn may negatively impact the future composition of the Bank's balance sheet, capital stock levels, core mission asset ratio, net income and dividend.\nFinance Agency Advisory Bulletin 2019-03 - Capital Stock Management. On August 14, 2019, the Finance Agency issued an Advisory Bulletin (the Capital Management AB) providing for each FHLBank to maintain a ratio of at least two percent of capital stock to total assets in order to help preserve the cooperative structure incentives that encourage members to remain fully engaged in the oversight of their investment in the Bank. In February 2020, the Finance Agency began to consider the proportion of capital stock to assets, measured on a daily average basis at month end, when assessing each FHLBank's capital management practices.\nThe Bank does not expect the Capital Management AB to have a material impact on its capital management practices, financial condition, and/or results of operations.\nFinance Agency Advisory Bulletin 2019-01 Business Resiliency Management. On May 7, 2019, the Finance Agency issued an Advisory Bulletin on Business Resiliency Management for FHLBanks and other entities regulated by the Finance Agency (the Business Resiliency AB) that communicates the Finance Agency's expectations with respect to minimizing the impact of disruptions in service from uncontrolled events and the maintenance of business operations at predefined levels. The Business Resiliency AB rescinds the Finance Agency's 2002 disaster recovery guidance. The new guidance states that a business resiliency program should guide the regulated entity to respond appropriately to disruptions affecting business operations, personnel, equipment, facilities, IT systems, and information assets. The Business Resiliency AB provides guidance on the elements of a safe and sound business resiliency program, which include governance, risk assessment and business impact analysis, risk mitigation and plan development, testing and analysis, and risk monitoring and program sustainability.\nThe Bank does not expect the Business Resiliency AB to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations.\nSEC Final Rule on Auditor Independence with Respect to Certain Loans or Debtor-Creditor Relationships. On July 5, 2019, the SEC published a final rule, which became effective on October 3, 2019 (the SEC Final Rule), that adopts amendments to its auditor independence rules to modify the analysis that must be conducted to determine whether an auditor is independent when the auditor has a lending relationship with certain shareholders of an audit client at any time during an audit or professional engagement period. The SEC Final Rule, among other things, focuses the analysis on beneficial ownership rather than on both record and beneficial ownership; replaces the existing ten percent bright-line shareholder ownership test with a significant influence\u201d test; and adds a known through reasonable inquiry\u201d standard with respect to identifying beneficial owners of the audit client's equity securities.\nUnder the prior loan rule on debtor-creditor relationships, the independence of an accounting firm generally could be called into question if it or a covered person in the accounting firm received a loan from a lender that is a record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the audit client's equity securities.\u201d A covered person in the firm includes personnel on the audit engagement team, personnel in the chain of command, partners and managers who provide ten or more hours of non-audit services to the audit client, and partners in the office where the lead engagement partner practices in connection with the client. The SEC Final Rule replaced the existing ten percent bright-line test with a significant influence test similar to that referenced in other SEC rules and based on concepts applied in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 323.\nUnder the SEC Final Rule, which is now in effect, with certain exceptions, the receipt of loans from the beneficial owners of an audit client's equity securities where such beneficial owner has significant influence over the audit client would impair the independence of the auditor. The analysis under the Final Rule would be based on the facts and circumstances and would focus on whether the beneficial owners of an audit client's equity securities have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of an audit client.\nThe Bank expects the SEC Final Rule to resolve the matters we discussed in Item 9B - Other Information in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn 2019, regulators published certain rules or issued guidance applicable to swaps:\nMargin and Capital Requirements for Covered Swap Entities. On November 7, 2019, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Farm Credit Administration and the Finance Agency (collectively, the Agencies) jointly published a proposed rule that, in addition to other changes, would amend the Agencies' regulations that established minimum margin and capital requirements for uncleared swaps (the prudential margin rules) for covered swap entities under the jurisdiction of one of the Agencies. In addition to other changes, the proposed amendments would permit those uncleared swaps entered into by a covered swap entity before the compliance date of the prudential margin rules to retain their legacy status and not become subject to the prudential margin rules in the event that such legacy swaps are amended to replace LIBOR or another rate that is reasonably expected to be discontinued or is reasonably determined to have lost its relevance as a reliable benchmark due to a significant impairment. Among other things, the proposed rule would also amend the prudential margin rules to (i) extend the phase-in compliance date of the covered swap entities for initial margin requirements from September 1, 2020 to September 1, 2021 for counterparties with an average daily aggregate notional amount (AANA) of non-cleared swaps from $8 billion to $50 billion, (ii) clarify that an Agency covered swap entity does not have to execute initial margin trading documentation with a counterparty prior to the time that the counterparty is required to collect or post initial margin, and (iii) permit legacy swaps to retain their legacy status and not become\nsubject to the prudential margin rules in the event that they are amended due to certain life-cycle activities, such as reductions of notional amounts or portfolio compression exercises.\nOn October 24, 2019, the CFTC proposed an amendment to its CFTC margin rules, which among other changes, would similarly extend the phase-in compliance date for initial margin requirements from September 1, 2020 to September 1, 2021 for counterparties with an AANA of non-cleared swaps from $8 billion to $50 billion. The Bank does not expect this rule, if adopted as proposed, to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. The Bank also believes the provisions of the rule related to LIBOR replacement, if adopted as proposed, may assist in the market's and the Bank's transition away from LIBOR.\nCFTC No-action Relief for LIBOR Amendments. On December 17, 2019, three divisions of the CFTC issued no-action letters to provide relief with respect to the transition away from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates (IBORs). Among other forms of relief, the letters, subject to certain limitations, (i) permit registered swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap participants, and major security-based swap participants (covered swap entities) to amend an uncleared swap entered into before the compliance date of the CFTC's uncleared swap margin requirements (such swap, a legacy swap, and such requirements, the CFTC margin rules) to include LIBOR or other IBOR fallbacks without the legacy swap becoming subject to the CFTC margin rules; and (ii) provide time-limited relief, until December 31, 2021, for (a) swaps that are not subject to the central clearing requirement because they were executed prior to the relevant compliance date and (b) swaps that are subject to the trade execution requirement to be amended to include LIBOR or other IBOR fallbacks without becoming subject to such clearing or trade execution requirements.\nThe Bank believes this relief may assist in the market's and the Bank's transition away from LIBOR.\nCFTC Advisory on Initial Margin Documentation Requirements. On July 9, 2019, the CFTC issued an advisory (the CFTC Advisory) on its Margin Requirements for Uncleared Swaps for Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants (the CFTC Margin Rules), to clarify that documentation governing the posting, collection, and custody of initial margin is not required to be completed until such time as the aggregate unmargined exposure to a counterparty (and its margin affiliates) exceeds an initial margin threshold of $50 million imposed by the regulation. The CFTC Advisory, however, instructs covered swap entities to closely monitor initial margin amounts if they are approaching the $50 million initial margin threshold with a counterparty and to take appropriate steps to ensure that the required documentation is in place at such time as the threshold is reached. The Bank is closely monitoring its initial margin thresholds on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis and is evaluating the impact of the CFTC Advisory on its documentation requirements.\nRisk Management\nThe Bank's lending, investment and funding activities, and use of derivative hedge instruments expose the Bank to a number of risks. A robust risk management framework aligns risk-taking activities with the Bank's strategies and risk appetite. A risk management framework also balances risks and rewards. The Bank's risk management framework consists of risk governance, risk appetite, and risk management policies.\nThe Bank's board of directors and management recognize that risks are inherent to the Bank's business model and that the process of establishing a risk appetite does not imply that the Bank seeks to mitigate or eliminate all risk. By defining and managing to a specific risk appetite, the board of directors and management ensure that there is a common understanding of the Bank's desired risk profile, which enhances strategic and tactical decisions. Additionally, the Bank aspires to (1) sustain a corporate culture of transparency, integrity, and adherence to legal and ethical obligations; and (2) achieve and exceed best practices in governance, ethics, and compliance.\nThe Bank's board of directors and management have established a risk appetite statement and risk metrics for controlling and escalating actions based on the following eight continuing objectives that represent the foundation of the Bank's strategic and tactical planning:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Capital Adequacy - maintain adequate levels of capital components (retained earnings and capital stock) that protect against the risks inherent on the Bank's balance sheet and provide sufficient resiliency to withstand potential stressed losses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Market Risk/Earnings - maintain an adequate ROE spread to average three-month LIBOR, while providing attractive funding for advance products, consistent payment of dividends, reliable access to funding, and maintenance of retained earnings in excess of stressed retained earnings targets within a conservative risk management framework.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Liquidity Risk - maintain sufficient liquidity and funding sources to allow the Bank to meet expected and unexpected obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Credit and Concentration Risk - avoid credit losses by managing credit and collateral risk exposures within acceptable parameters.

Accordingly, the Bank believes that reporting, analyzing, and mitigating risks are paramount to successful corporate governance.\nThe RMP also governs the Bank's approach to managing the above risks. The Bank's board of directors reviews the RMP annually and approves amendments to the RMP from time to time as necessary. To promote compliance with the RMP, the Bank has established internal management committees to provide oversight of these risks. The Bank produces a comprehensive risk assessment report on an annual basis that is reviewed by the board of directors. In addition to the established risk appetite and the RMP, the Bank is also subject to Finance Agency regulations and policies regarding risk management.\nTransition of LIBOR to an Alternative Reference Rate\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that after 2021 it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR. In response, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee to identify a set of alternative reference interest rates for possible use as market benchmarks. This committee has proposed SOFR as its recommended alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in the second quarter of 2018. SOFR is based on a broad segment of the overnight Treasury repurchase market and is intended to be a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities.\nCertain of the Bank's assets and liabilities, and certain collateral pledged to the Bank, are indexed to LIBOR, with exposure extending past December 31, 2021. The Bank is currently evaluating and planning for the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including the possibility of SOFR as the dominant replacement. In general, the transition away from LIBOR may result in increased market risk, credit risk, operational risk and business risk for the Bank. The Bank has adopted a LIBOR transition plan, which outlines the Bank's transition activities, including LIBOR exposure evaluation, risk management, legal, operational, systems and operations, shareholder and external communication and education, and other aspects of planning. The Bank has a LIBOR Steering Committee, which oversees the Bank's transition away from LIBOR in accordance with the strategies and requirements put forth by senior management and regulatory guidance, providing periodic reports to the Bank's executive management committee and board of directors.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Bank ceased purchasing assets tied to LIBOR with a contractual maturity beyond December 31, 2021. In light of this change, the Bank is evaluating its investment and related hedging strategy, including the availability of alternate permissible investments. In addition, beginning March 31, 2020, the Bank will cease entering into new LIBOR-based transactions involving advances, debt, derivatives, or other products with maturities beyond December 31, 2021. In preparation for this change and to help manage balance sheet exposure to LIBOR-indexed assets and liabilities with maturities\nbeyond 2021, the Bank has begun updating its systems, participating in the issuance of SOFR-indexed consolidated bonds, issuing SOFR-linked advances, and swapping certain financial instruments to OIS and SOFR as an alternative interest rate hedging strategy for certain financial instruments. The pace of transition, however, is dependent on external factors, including market developments and demand. The Bank closely monitors and participates in industry activity related to LIBOR transition, including those of the Alternate Reference Rate Committee and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. The Bank will update its pledged collateral certification reporting requirements as of March 31, 2020 so that members may distinguish LIBOR-linked collateral maturing past December 31, 2021. The Bank intends to utilize this information in connection with its LIBOR exposure evaluation and risk management.\nAs part of the Bank's risk LIBOR exposure evaluation and risk management, the Bank is developing an inventory of financial instruments impacted by the LIBOR transition and working to identify contracts that may require adding or adjusting the fallback language. The Bank has added or adjusted fallback language in advance confirmations, consolidated obligations and its credit and collateral policy to include fallback language addressing the discontinuation of LIBOR as a benchmark rate. The Bank continues to monitor the market-wide efforts to address fallback language related to derivatives and cash products.\nThe Bank's exposure to advances, investment securities, and consolidated obligation bonds with interest rates indexed to LIBOR as of December 31, 2019 is set forth below (in millions).\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Par Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Advances (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investments Securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Consolidated Obligation Bonds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable-rate financial instruments outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> LIBOR\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> SOFR\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other\n</td> <td>7,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total variable-rate financial instruments outstanding\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LIBOR-indexed financial instruments by contractual maturity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Due before or on December 31, 2021\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Due after December 31, 2021\n</td> <td>2,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total LIBOR-indexed financial instruments by contractual maturity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes all fixed-rate advances that have cap/floor optionality and excludes convertible advances.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank's exposure to derivatives with interest rates indexed to LIBOR as of December 31, 2019 is set forth below (in millions).\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Notional Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pay Leg\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Receive Leg\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Cleared\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Uncleared\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cleared\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Uncleared\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terminates before or on December 31, 2021\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>265\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terminates after December 31, 2021\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total LIBOR-indexed Derivatives by termination date\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBelow is a more specific discussion of how the Bank manages its market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk, and business risk within this risk management and appetite framework.\nMarket Risk\nGeneral\nThe Bank is exposed to market risk because changes in interest rates and spreads can have a direct effect on the value of the Bank's assets and liabilities. As a result of the volume of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest-rate risk component of market risk has the greatest impact on the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest-rate risk represents the risk that the aggregate market value or estimated fair value of the Bank's asset, liability, and derivative portfolios will decline as a result of interest-rate volatility or that net earnings will be affected significantly by interest-rate changes. Interest-rate risk can occur in a variety of forms including repricing risk, yield-curve risk, basis risk, and option risk. The Bank faces repricing risk whenever an asset and a liability reprice at different times and with different rates, resulting in interest-margin sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Yield-curve risk reflects the possibility that changes in the shape of the yield curve may affect the market value of the Bank's assets and liabilities differently because a liability used to fund an asset may be short-term, while the asset is long-term, or vice versa. Basis risk occurs when yields on assets and costs on liabilities are based on different bases, such as LIBOR, versus the Bank's cost of funds. Different bases can move at different rates or in different directions, which can cause erratic changes in revenues and expenses. Option risk is presented by the optionality that is embedded in some assets and liabilities. Mortgage assets represent the primary source of option risk.\nThe primary goal of the Bank's interest-rate risk measurement and management efforts is to control the above risks through prudent asset-liability management strategies so that the Bank may provide members with dividends that are consistently competitive with existing market interest rates on alternative short-term and variable-rate investments. The Bank attempts to manage interest-rate risk exposure by using appropriate funding instruments and hedging strategies. Hedging may occur at the micro level, for one or more specifically identified transactions, or at the macro level. Management evaluates the Bank's macro hedge position and funding strategies on a daily basis and makes adjustments as necessary.\nThe Bank measures its potential market risk exposure in a number of ways. These include asset, liability, and equity duration analyses; and earnings forecast scenario analyses that reflect repricing gaps. The Bank establishes tolerance limits for these financial metrics and uses internal models to measure each of these risk exposures at least monthly.\nUse of Derivatives\nThe Bank enters into derivatives to reduce the interest-rate risk exposure inherent in otherwise unhedged assets and funding positions and attempts to do so in the most cost-efficient manner. The Bank does not engage in speculative trading of these instruments. The Bank's derivative positions may include interest-rate swaps, options, swaptions, interest-rate cap and floor agreements, and forward contracts. These derivatives are used to adjust the effective maturity, repricing frequency, or option characteristics of financial instruments to achieve risk-management objectives. Within its risk management strategy, the Bank uses derivative financial instruments in the following two ways:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>As a fair-value hedge of an underlying financial instrument or a firm commitment. For example, the Bank uses derivatives to reduce the interest-rate net sensitivity of consolidated obligations, advances, and investments by, in effect, converting them to a short-term interest rate. The Bank also uses derivatives to manage embedded options in assets and liabilities and to hedge the market value of existing assets and liabilities. The Bank's management reevaluates its hedging strategies from time to time and may change the hedging techniques used or adopt new strategies as deemed prudent.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>As an asset-liability management tool, for which hedge accounting is not applied (non-qualifying hedge). The Bank may enter into derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Consequently, these transactions can introduce earnings volatility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents the notional amounts of derivative financial instruments (in millions).

The primary methods used are (1) calculating the effective duration of assets, liabilities, and equity under various scenarios; and (2) calculating the theoretical market value of equity. Effective duration, normally expressed in years or months, measures the price sensitivity of the Bank's interest-bearing assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. As effective duration lengthens, market-value changes become more sensitive to interest-rate changes. The Bank employs sophisticated modeling systems to measure effective duration.\nEffective duration of equity aggregates the estimated sensitivity of market value for each of the Bank's financial assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. Effective duration of equity is computed by taking the market value-weighted effective duration of assets, less the market value-weighted effective duration of liabilities, and dividing the remainder by the market value of equity. Market value of equity is not indicative of the market value of the Bank as a going concern or the value of the Bank in a liquidation scenario. An effective duration gap is the measure of the difference between the estimated effective durations of portfolio assets and liabilities and summarizes the extent to which the estimated cash flows for assets and liabilities are matched, on average, over time and across interest-rate scenarios.\nA positive effective duration of equity or a positive effective duration gap results when the effective duration of assets is greater than the effective duration of liabilities. A negative effective duration of equity or a negative effective duration gap results when the effective duration of assets is less than the effective duration of liabilities. A positive effective duration of equity or a positive effective duration gap generally indicates that the Bank has some exposure to interest-rate risk in a rising rate environment, and a negative effective duration of equity or a negative effective duration gap generally indicates some exposure to interest-rate risk in a declining interest-rate environment. Higher effective duration numbers, whether positive or negative, indicate greater volatility of market value of equity in response to changing interest rates.\nBank policy requires the Bank to maintain its effective duration of equity within a range of plus five years to minus five years, assuming current interest rates, and within a range of plus seven years to minus seven years, assuming an instantaneous parallel increase or decrease in market interest rates of 200 basis points.\nThe following table presents the Bank's effective duration exposure measurements as calculated in accordance with Bank policy (in years).\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Down 200 Basis\nPoints (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Base Case\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Up 200 Basis Points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Down 200 Basis\nPoints (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Base Case\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Up 200 Basis Points\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets\n</td> <td>0.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities\n</td> <td>0.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>0.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.95\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.80\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective duration gap\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.05\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The down 200 basis points\u201d scenarios shown above are considered to be constrained shocks,\u201d intended to prevent the possibility of negative interest rates when a designated low rate environment exists.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank uses both sophisticated computer models and an experienced professional staff to measure the amount of interest-rate risk in the balance sheet, thus allowing management to monitor the risk against policy and regulatory limits. Management regularly reviews the major assumptions and methodologies used in the Bank's models and will make adjustments to the Bank's assumptions and methodologies in response to rapid changes in economic conditions.\nThe prepayment risk in both advances and investment assets can significantly affect the Bank's effective duration of equity and effective duration gap. Current regulations require the Bank to mitigate advance prepayment risk by establishing prepayment fees that make the Bank financially indifferent to a borrower's decision to prepay an advance that carries a rate above current market rates unless the advance contains explicit par value prepayment options. The Bank's prepayment fees for advances without embedded options are generally based on the present value of the difference between the rate on the prepaid advance and the current rate on an advance with an identical maturity date. Prepayment fees for advances that contain embedded options are generally based on the inverse of the market value of the derivative instrument that the Bank used to hedge the advance.\nThe prepayment options embedded in mortgage loan and mortgage security assets may shorten or lengthen both the actual and expected cash flows when interest rates change. Current Finance Agency policies limit this source of interest-rate risk by\nlimiting the types of MBS the Bank may own to those with defined estimated average life changes under specific interest-rate shock scenarios. These limits do not apply to mortgage loans purchased from members. The Bank typically hedges mortgage prepayment uncertainty by using callable debt as a funding source and by using interest-rate cap, floor, and swaption transactions. The Bank also uses derivatives to reduce effective duration and option risks for investment securities other than MBS. Effective duration and option risk exposures are measured on a regular basis for all investment assets under alternative rate scenarios.\nThe Bank also analyzes its interest-rate risk and market exposure by evaluating the theoretical market value of equity. The market value of equity represents the net result of the present value of future cash flows discounted to arrive at the theoretical market value of each balance sheet item. By using the discounted present value of future cash flows, the Bank is able to factor in the various maturities of assets and liabilities, similar to the effective duration analysis discussed above. The Bank determines the theoretical market value of assets and liabilities utilizing a Level 3 pricing approach as more fully described in Note 18-Estimated Fair Values to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements. The difference between the market value of total assets and the market value of total liabilities is the market value of equity. A more volatile market value of equity under different shock scenarios tends to result in a higher effective duration of equity, indicating increased sensitivity to interest rate changes.\nThe following table presents the Bank's market value of equity measurements as calculated in accordance with Bank policy (in millions).

The Bank's objective is to meet operational and member liquidity needs under all reasonable economic and operational situations. The Bank uses liquidity to absorb fluctuations in asset and liability balances and to provide an adequate reservoir of funding to support attractive and stable advance pricing. The Bank meets its liquidity needs from both asset and liability sources.\nThe Bank faces the following two basic types of liquidity risk: operational and contingent. The Bank maintains operational and contingent liquidity in compliance with regulatory requirements and performs a supplemental analysis to confirm that the Bank has sufficient liquidity reserves, as discussed in further detail in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources above.\nCredit Risk\nThe Bank faces credit risk primarily with respect to its advances, investments, derivatives, and mortgage loan assets.\nAdvances\nSecured advances to member financial institutions account for the largest category of Bank assets; thus, advances are a major source of the Bank's credit risk exposure. The Bank uses a risk-focused approach to credit and collateral underwriting. The Bank attempts to reduce credit risk on advances by monitoring the financial condition of borrowers and the quality and value of the assets that borrowers pledge as eligible collateral.\nThe Bank determines credit risk rating or risk level ratings for its members by evaluating each institution's overall financial health, taking into account the quality of assets, earnings, and capital position. Prior to September 27, 2019, the Bank assigned each borrower that is an insured depository institution or an insurance company a credit risk rating from one to 10 according to the relative amount of credit risk that such borrower poses to the Bank (one being the least amount of credit risk and 10 the greatest amount of credit risk). The Bank assigned each borrower that is not an insured depository institution or insurance company (including housing associates, community development financial institutions, and corporate credit unions), a risk level rating based on a risk matrix developed for each entity type. Each risk level rating generally corresponds to the one to 10 credit risk rating for insured depository institutions, 101 being the least amount of credit risk and 104 the greatest amount of credit risk.\nBeginning on September 27, 2019, the Bank no longer assigned each borrower that is an insurance company a credit risk rating from one to 10, and began assigning a risk level rating by utilizing an external model. The rating process for other borrowers remains unchanged.\nIn general, borrowers with the greatest amount of credit risk may have more restrictions on the types of collateral they may use to secure advances, may be required to maintain higher collateral maintenance levels and deliver loan collateral, may be restricted from obtaining further advances, and may face more stringent collateral reporting requirements. At times, based upon the Bank's assessment of a borrower and its collateral, the Bank may place more restrictive requirements on a borrower than those generally applicable to borrowers with the same rating. Management and the board also monitor the Bank's concentration in secured credit and standby letters of credit exposure to individual borrowers.\nThe following table presents the number of borrowers and the par value of advances outstanding to borrowers with the specified ratings as of the specified dates (dollars in millions).\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nBorrowers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding\nAdvances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nBorrowers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding\nAdvances\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>361\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>262\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal(rating from 1 to 10)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>541\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal(rating from 101 to 104)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>541\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total par value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank establishes a credit limit for each borrower. The credit limit is not a committed line of credit, but rather an indication of the borrower's general borrowing capacity with the Bank. The Bank determines the credit limit in its sole and absolute discretion by evaluating a wide variety of factors that indicate the borrower's overall creditworthiness. The credit limit is generally expressed as a percentage equal to the ratio of the borrower's total liabilities to the Bank (including the face amount of outstanding standby letters of credit, the par value of outstanding advances, and the total exposure of the Bank to the borrower under any derivative contract) to the borrower's total assets. Generally, borrowers are held to a credit limit of no more\nthan 30 percent. However, the Bank's board of directors, or a relevant committee thereof, may approve a higher limit at its discretion, and such borrowers may be subject to certain additional collateral reporting and maintenance requirements. Five borrowers have been approved for a credit limit higher than 30 percent, and their total outstanding advance and standby letters of credit balance was $23.6 billion and $573 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.\nThe Bank obtains collateral on advances to protect against losses, but Finance Agency regulations permit the Bank to accept only certain types of collateral. Each borrower must maintain an amount of qualifying collateral that, when discounted to the lendable collateral value (LCV), is equal to at least 100 percent of the borrower's outstanding par value of all advances and other liabilities from the Bank. The LCV is the value that the Bank assigns to each type of qualifying collateral for purposes of determining the amount of credit that such qualifying collateral will support. For each type of qualifying collateral, the Bank discounts the market value of the qualifying collateral to calculate the LCV. The Bank regularly reevaluates the appropriate level of discounting. The Bank had rights to collateral on a borrower-by-borrower basis with an estimated value equal to or greater than its outstanding extension of credit as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The following table presents information about the types of collateral held for the Bank's advances (dollars in millions).\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total Par Value of Outstanding Advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LCV of Collateral Pledged by Members\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First Mortgage Collateral (%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Securities Collateral (%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other Real Estate Related Collateral (%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>348,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.68\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>108,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>338,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.19\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor purposes of determining each member's LCV, the Bank estimates the current market value of all residential first mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity loans, and lines of credit pledged as collateral based on information provided by the member on its loan portfolio or on individual loans through the regular collateral reporting process. The estimated market value is discounted to account for the (1) price volatility of loans, (2) model data uncertainty, and (3) estimated liquidation and servicing costs in the event of the member's default. Market values, and thus LCVs, change monthly. The use of this market-based valuation methodology allows the Bank to establish its collateral discounts with greater precision and to provide greater transparency with respect to the valuation of collateral pledged for advances and other credit products offered by the Bank.\nThe FHLBank Act affords any security interest granted to the Bank by any member of the Bank, or any affiliate of any such member, priority over the claims and rights of any party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor) other than the claims and rights of a party that (1) would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law; and (2) is an actual bona fide purchaser for value or is an actual secured party whose security interest is perfected in accordance with applicable state law.\nIn its history, the Bank has never experienced a credit loss on an advance. In consideration of this and the Bank's policies and practices detailed above, the Bank has not established an allowance for credit losses on advances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nInvestments\nThe Bank is subject to credit risk on unsecured investments, such as interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold. These investments are generally transacted with government agencies and large financial institutions that are considered to be of investment quality.\nIn addition to Finance Agency regulations, the Bank has established guidelines approved by its board of directors regarding unsecured extensions of credit, with respect to term limits and eligible counterparties.\nFinance Agency regulations prohibit the Bank from investing in any of the following securities:\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>instruments, such as common stock, that represent an ownership interest in an entity, other than stock in small business investment companies, or certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>instruments issued by non-United States entities, other than those issued by United States branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>debt instruments that are not of investment quality, other than certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities and instruments that the Bank determined became less than investment quality because of developments or events that occurred after purchase by the Bank;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whole mortgages or other whole loans, other than the following: (1) those acquired under the Bank's mortgage purchase programs; (2) certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities; (3) certain marketable direct obligations of state, local, or tribal government units or agencies that are of investment quality; (4) MBS or asset-backed securities that are backed by manufactured housing loans or home equity loans; and (5) certain foreign housing loans that are authorized under section 12(b) of the FHLBank Act;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>interest-only or principal-only stripped MBS, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), collateralized debt obligations, and real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>residual-interest or interest-accrual classes of CMOs and REMICs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fixed-rate or variable-rate MBS, CMOs, and REMICs that are at rates equal to their contractual cap on the trade date and that have average lives that vary by more than six years under an assumed instantaneous interest-rate change of 300 basis points; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>non-U.S. dollar denominated securities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinance Agency regulations do not permit the Bank to rely exclusively on Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) ratings with respect to its investments. The Bank is required to make a determination of whether a security is of investment quality based on its own documented analysis, which includes the NRSRO rating as one of the factors that is assessed to determine investment quality. The Bank monitors the financial condition of investment counterparties to ensure that they are in compliance with the Bank's RMP and Finance Agency regulations. Unsecured credit exposure to any counterparty is limited by the credit quality and capital of the counterparty and by the capital of the Bank. On a regular basis, management produces financial monitoring reports detailing the financial condition of the Bank's counterparties. These reports are reviewed by the Bank's board of directors. In addition to the Bank's RMP and regulatory requirements, the Bank may limit or suspend overnight and term trading. Limiting or suspending counterparties limits the pool of available counterparties, shifts the geographical distribution of counterparty exposure, and may reduce the Bank's overall investment opportunities.\nThe Bank only enters into investments with U.S. counterparties or U.S. branch offices of foreign banks that have been approved by the Bank through its internal approval process, but the Bank may still have exposure to foreign entities if a counterparty's parent entity is located in another country. The following tables present the Bank's gross exposure, by instrument type, according to the location of the parent company of the counterparty (in millions).\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Federal Funds Sold (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest-bearing\nDeposits (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Derivative Exposure (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Australia\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Austria\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>2,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finland\n</td> <td>1,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Germany\n</td> <td>1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Japan\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Netherlands\n</td> <td>450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Norway\n</td> <td>1,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Switzerland\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States of America\n</td> <td>1,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Federal funds sold includes $100 million with BankUnited, National Association, one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> (2) Interest-bearing deposits include a $508 million business money market account with Truist Bank, one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2019.\n(3) Amounts do not reflect collateral;

As of December 31, 2019, DnB Bank ASA was the only counterparty that had greater than 10 percent of the total unsecured credit exposure to non-U.S. government or non-U.S. government agencies counterparties. DnB Bank ASA had 11.0 percent of the total unsecured credit exposure to non-U.S. government or non-U.S. government agencies counterparties. As of December 31, 2019, this unsecured credit portfolio consisted primarily of federal funds sold with overnight maturities.\nThe Bank's RMP permits the Bank to invest in U.S. agency (i.e., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) obligations including the following: (1) CMOs and REMICS that are backed by such securities; and (2) other MBS, CMOs, and REMICS that are of sufficient investment quality, which typically have the highest credit ratings issued by S&P or Moody's at the time of purchase. The private-label MBS purchased by the Bank originally attained their triple-A ratings through credit\nenhancements, which primarily consisted of the subordination of the claims of the other tranches of these securities. In addition to NRSRO ratings, the Bank considers a variety of credit quality factors when analyzing potential investments, such as collateral performance, marketability, asset class considerations, local and regional economic conditions, and the financial health of the underlying issuer.\nThe following tables present information on the credit ratings of the Bank's investments held as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in millions), based on their credit ratings as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The credit ratings reflect the lowest long-term credit ratings as reported by an NRSRO.\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Resell\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell are considered collateralized financing arrangements and effectively represent short-term loans transacted with counterparties that the Bank considers to be of investment quality. The terms of these loans are structured such that if the fair value of the underlying securities decreases below the fair value required as collateral, the counterparty must place an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an equivalent amount of cash. If an agreement to resell is deemed to be impaired, the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the agreement is recognized in earnings. Based upon the collateral held as security, the Bank determined that no allowance for credit losses was needed for the securities purchased under agreements to resell as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nNon-MBS Held-to-maturity Securities\nThe unrealized losses related to non-MBS held-to-maturity securities are caused by interest-rate changes. These losses are considered temporary as the Bank expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis on its non-MBS held-to-maturity securities in unrealized loss positions and neither intends to sell these securities nor considers it more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before its anticipated recovery of each security's remaining amortized cost basis. As a result, Bank does not consider these non-MBS held-to-maturity securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2019.\nNon-Private-label MBS\nThe unrealized losses related to government-sponsored enterprise MBS are caused by interest-rate changes. Because these securities are guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, it is expected that these securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost basis. The Bank does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2019 because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality; the Bank does not intend to sell the investments; and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.\nPrivate-label MBS\nFor disclosure purposes, the Bank classifies private-label MBS as either prime or Alt-A based upon the overall credit quality of the underlying loans as determined by the originator at the time of origination, unless otherwise noted. Although there is no universally accepted definition of Alt-A, generally, loans with credit characteristics that range between prime and subprime are classified as Alt-A. Participants in the mortgage market have used the Alt-A classification principally to describe loans for which the underwriting process has been streamlined in order to reduce the documentation requirements of the borrower or allow for alternative documentation.\nThe following table presents information, based on investment ratings, on the Bank's private-label MBS as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in millions).

In January 2020, the Bank sold its private-label MBS portfolio. See Note 22-Subsequent Events to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements for additional information.\nDerivatives\nThe Bank is subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to its derivative transactions. The amount of credit risk on derivatives depends on the extent to which netting procedures, collateral requirements, and other credit enhancements are used and are effective in mitigating the risk. The Bank manages credit risk through credit analysis, collateral management, and other credit enhancements. The Bank is also required to follow the requirements set forth by applicable regulations.\nThe Bank's over-the-counter derivative transactions may either be (1) uncleared derivatives, which are executed bilaterally with a counterparty; or (2) cleared derivatives, which are cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (clearing agent) with a Derivative Clearing Organization (Clearinghouse). Once a derivative transaction has been accepted for clearing by a Clearinghouse, the executing counterparty is replaced with the Clearinghouse as the counterparty.\nFor uncleared derivatives, the Bank is subject to nonperformance by counterparties. The Bank generally is required to post or collect collateral on uncleared derivative transactions. The amount of net unsecured credit exposure that is permissible with respect to each counterparty depends on the credit rating of that counterparty. A counterparty must deliver collateral to the Bank if the total market value of the Bank's exposure to that counterparty rises above a specific trigger point. As a result of these risk mitigation initiatives, the Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its uncleared derivatives as of December 31, 2019.\nCertain of the Bank's uncleared derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Bank to post additional collateral with its counterparties if there is a deterioration in the Bank's credit rating. If the Bank's credit rating had been lowered from its current rating to the next lower rating, the Bank would have been required to deliver $2 million of collateral at fair value to its uncleared derivative counterparties as of December 31, 2019.\nIf the counterparty has an NRSRO rating, the net exposure after collateral is treated as unsecured credit, consistent with the Bank's RMP and Finance Agency regulations. If the counterparty does not have an NRSRO rating, the Bank requires collateral for the full amount of the exposure.\nFor cleared derivatives, the Bank is subject to credit risk due to nonperformance by the Clearinghouse and clearing agent. The requirement that the Bank post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent, to the Clearinghouse, exposes the Bank to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the Clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. The use of cleared derivatives mitigates credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties, and collateral is posted daily for changes in the value of cleared derivatives through a clearing agent. The Bank utilizes two Clearinghouses for all cleared derivative transactions, LCH Ltd. and CME Clearing. Variation margin is characterized as daily settlement payments and is netted directly against the derivative's gross recognized amount. Initial margin is considered cash collateral. Because of the limited number of Clearinghouses and clearing agents, a risk of concentration is introduced. The Bank actively monitors Clearinghouses and clearing agents. An annual review of the Bank's Clearinghouses is performed, and the Bank also monitors its exposure to Clearinghouses on a monthly basis. The Bank also monitors the clearing agents through its unsecured credit system, and the Bank subjects these clearing agents to the same limits as other bilate\nral derivative counterparties. The parent companies of the clearing agents are monitored through annual reviews, as well as through the Bank's daily monitoring tools, which include reviewing equity triggers, debt triggers, and credit default swap spread triggers. In addition, exposures to the clearing agents are monitored daily on a swap counterparty report. The Bank currently has the following three approved clearing agents: Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, and Goldman Sachs & Co. The Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its cleared derivatives as of December 31, 2019.\nThe contractual or notional amount of derivative transactions reflects the involvement of the Bank in the various classes of financial instruments; however, the Bank's maximum credit risk with respect to derivative transactions is the estimated cost of replacing the derivative transactions if there is default, less the value of any related collateral, including initial and variation margin. In determining the maximum credit risk, the Bank considers accrued interest receivables and payables, as well as the netting requirements to net assets and liabilities.\nThe following tables present information on the credit ratings of, and the Bank's credit exposure to, its derivative counterparties (in millions). The credit ratings reflect the lowest long-term credit rating by an NRSRO.\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

physically held by or on behalf of the Bank or collateral assigned to the Bank, as evidenced by a written security agreement, and held by the member institution for the benefit of the Bank.\nMortgage Loan Programs\nThe Bank seeks to manage the credit risk associated with the MPP and the MPF Program by maintaining underwriting and eligibility standards and structuring possible losses into several layers to be shared with the PFIs.\nMortgage loans purchased under the MPP and MPF Program must comply with the underwriting and eligibility standards set forth in applicable MPP guidelines or MPF guidelines. In both MPP and MPF, the Bank and PFIs share the risk of losses on mortgage loans by structuring potential losses on conventional mortgage loans into layers with respect to each master commitment and in compliance with the applicable regulations governing the purchase of mortgage loans by the Bank.\nThe unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans was $297 million and $361 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans was $1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems, or from external events. Operational risk for the Bank also includes reputation and legal risks associated with business practices or market conduct that the Bank may undertake. Operational risk inherently is greatest where transaction processes include numerous processing steps, require greater subjectivity, or are non-routine. The Bank operates in a complex business environment and is subject to numerous regulatory requirements.\nThe Bank identifies risk through daily operational monitoring, independent reviews, and the strategic planning and risk assessment programs that both consider the operational risk ramifications of the Bank's business strategies and environment. The Bank has established comprehensive financial and operating policies and procedures to mitigate the likelihood of loss resulting from the identified operational risks. In addition, the Bank's operational risk committee is responsible for overseeing the Bank's risk management policies, procedures, strategies, and activities related to operational risks, including overseeing the monitoring process and review of risk assessments. This oversight also includes compliance risk and reputational risk. The Bank effects related changes in processes, information systems, lines of communication, and other internal controls as deemed appropriate in response to identified or anticipated increases in operational risk.\nThe board of directors has an Enterprise Risk and Operations Committee (EROC) to advise and assist the board with respect to enterprise risk management, operations, information technology, and other related matters. In addition, the Bank's internal Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) is responsible for the management and oversight of the Bank's risk management programs and practices. Additionally, the Bank's Internal Audit department, which reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Bank's board of directors, regularly tests compliance with the policies and procedures related to managing operational risks.\nCyber-Related Risks. The efficiencies offered by information technology (IT) are necessary components of Bank operations. The IT architecture supports multiple operating systems, database structures, and virtualized servers to support business applications that are a mixture of vendor-licensed and in-house developed. Cyber-attacks are increasing globally across all business sectors and cyber attackers are finding more ways to penetrate organizations' systems. Cybersecurity threats can result in damage to the Bank's physical facilities, technology systems, and/or the Bank's intangible assets. Successful attacks can have a financial, legal, and reputational impact on the Bank as well as disrupt the Bank's ability to serve its shareholders.\nThe Bank's board of directors, through EROC, oversees the major dimensions of the Bank's information technology program including management information systems to ensure alignment with the Bank's strategic plan, risk management activities, and operational performance standards. In that role, EROC oversees the development, implementation and maintenance of the Bank's information security program including recommending action to the board with respect to the Bank's information security policy on an annual basis and reviewing reports on the effectiveness of the Bank's information security program. The Bank's internal ERC reviews and reports to the board on the risk exposures and risk appetites of the Bank, including those related to information technology. In addition, the Bank's internal Information Technology Governance Committee oversees IT governance, including: IT risk management and IT operational performance, and the Bank's internal Security Governance Committee provides independent and integrated oversight of the information security program. Each of these committees provide information and make recommendations to the board, through the Bank's executive management committee, regarding their respective oversight authority.\nBusiness Risk\nBusiness risk is the risk of an adverse effect on the Bank's profitability resulting from external factors that may occur in both the short- and the long-term. Business risk includes political, strategic, reputation, and regulatory events that are beyond the Bank's control. In particular, during 2019 and continuing into 2020, the Bank faces business risk, which may include changes in:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the overall economy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the financial services industry or the Bank's competitive environment; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>legislation, regulation, or congressional scrutiny affecting the Bank or its members.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor discussion of the Bank's competition for advances, see Item 1, Business-Competition above. For discussion of recent regulatory activity that may have a material impact on the Bank's operations, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Legislative and Regulatory Developments. The Bank attempts to mitigate these risks through long-term strategic planning and through continually monitoring economic indicators and the external environment.\nCyclicality and Seasonality\nThe Bank's business and the demand for advances from the Bank are generally not subject to the effects of cyclical or seasonal variations, although the Bank's advance demand may vary based upon fluctuations of its members' consumer credit liquidity needs.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe majority of the Bank's assets and liabilities are, and will continue to be, monetary in nature. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or to the same extent, as the prices of goods and services, higher rates of inflation generally result in corresponding increases in interest rates. Inflation, coupled with increasing interest rates, generally has the following effects on the Bank:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the cost of the Bank's funds and operating overhead increases;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the yield on variable-rate assets held by the Bank

during 2019, compared to 2018. Additionally, changes in interest rates and their subsequent impact on the Bank's derivative positions, interest-earning assets, and interest bearing liabilities contributed to the decrease in net income and net interest income during 2019. These changes in interest rates impacted interest expense related to interest-bearing liabilities more than the offsetting interest income related to interest-earning assets. The impact of derivatives and hedging activities was a reduction to net interest income of $31 million in 2019. Beginning on January 1, 2019, changes in fair value of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk for designated fair value hedges are recorded in net interest income in the same line as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Prior to January 1, 2019, for fair value hedges, any hedge ineffectiveness (which represented the amount by which the change in the fair value of the derivative differed from the change in the fair value of the hedge item) was recorded in noninterest income as net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities.\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Notional Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pay Leg\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Receive Leg\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Cleared\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Uncleared\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cleared\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Uncleared\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terminates before or on December 31, 2021\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>265\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terminates after December 31, 2021\n</td> <td>263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total LIBOR-indexed Derivatives by termination date\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank carries certain assets and liabilities, including investments classified as trading and available-for-sale and all derivatives, on the balance sheet at fair value.

On May 7, 2019, the Finance Agency issued an Advisory Bulletin on Business Resiliency Management for FHLBanks and other entities regulated by the Finance Agency (the Business Resiliency AB) that communicates the Finance Agency's expectations with respect to minimizing the impact of disruptions in service from uncontrolled events and the maintenance of business operations at predefined levels. The Business Resiliency AB rescinds the Finance Agency's 2002 disaster recovery guidance. The new guidance states that a business resiliency program should guide the regulated entity to respond appropriately to disruptions affecting business operations, personnel, equipment, facilities, IT systems, and information assets. The Business Resiliency AB provides guidance on the elements of a safe and sound business resiliency program, which include governance, risk assessment and business impact analysis, risk mitigation and plan development, testing and analysis, and risk monitoring and program sustainability.\n (1) Interest-bearing deposits include a $508 million business money market account with Truist Bank and a $409 million business money market account with Branch Banking and Trust Company, one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \nSEC Final Rule on Auditor Independence with Respect to Certain Loans or Debtor-Creditor Relationships.

avoid credit losses by managing credit and collateral risk exposures within acceptable parameters. Achieve this objective through data-driven analysis (and when appropriate, perform shareholder-specific analysis), monitoring, and verification, including new collateral policy expansions to ensure appropriate controls and that monitoring is consistent with managing existing credit and collateral risk exposures. Monitor through enhanced reporting any elevated risk concentrations, and when appropriate, manage and mitigate the increased risk. \n \u2022 prepayments; \nwill be able to identify and prudently manage the risks associated with the termination of LIBOR in a safe and sound manner.\nFor cleared derivatives, the Bank is subject to credit risk due to nonperformance by the Clearinghouse and clearing agent. The requirement that the Bank post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent, to the Clearinghouse, exposes the Bank to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the Clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. The use of cleared derivatives mitigates credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties, and collateral is posted daily for changes in the value of cleared derivatives through a clearing agent. The Bank utilizes two Clearinghouses for all cleared derivative transactions, LCH Ltd. and CME Clearing. Variation margin is characterized as daily settlement payments and is netted directly against the derivative's gross recognized amount. Initial margin is considered cash collateral. Because of the limited number of Clearinghouses and clearing agents, a risk of concentration is introduced. The Bank actively monitors Clearinghouses and clearing agents. An annual review of the Bank's Clearinghouses is performed, and the Bank also monitors its exposure to Clearinghouses on a monthly basis. The Bank also monitors the clearing agents through its unsecured credit system, and the Bank subjects these clearing agents to the same limits as other bilate\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net impairment losses recognized in earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(291.12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61.92\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains (losses) on trading securities\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>402.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(114.53\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(312\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(91.55\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit fees\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.35\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>498.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77.47\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63.17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(86.04\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank offers demand and overnight deposit programs to members and qualifying non-members primarily as a liquidity management service. In addition, a member that services mortgage loans may deposit funds in the Bank that are collected in connection with the mortgage loans, pending disbursement of those funds to the owners of the mortgage loans. For demand deposits, the Bank pays interest at the overnight rate. Most of these deposits represent member liquidity investments, which members may withdraw on demand. Therefore, the total account balance of the Bank's deposits may fluctuate significantly. As a matter of prudence, the Bank typically invests deposit funds in liquid short-term assets. Member loan demand, deposit flows, and liquidity management strategies influence the amount and volatility of deposit balances carried with the Bank.\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Down 200 Basis\nPoints (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Base Case\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Up 200 Basis Points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Down 200 Basis\nPoints (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Base Case\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Up 200 Basis Points\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liabilities\n</td> <td>142,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>141,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>147,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>7,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinance Agency Advisory Bulletin 2019-03 - Capital Stock Management.

On December 12, 2019, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a proposed rule to amend its brokered deposits restrictions that apply to less than well capitalized insured depository institutions. The FDIC states that the proposed amendments are intended to modernize its brokered deposit regulations and would establish a new framework for analyzing whether deposits placed through deposit placement arrangements qualify as brokered deposits. These deposit placement arrangements include those between insured depository institutions and third parties, such as financial technology companies, for a variety of business purposes, including access to deposits. By creating a new framework for analyzing certain provisions of the deposit broker\u201d definition, including shortening the list of activities considered facilitating\u201d and expanding the scope of the primary purpose\u201d exception, the proposed rule would narrow the definition of deposit broker\u201d and exclude more deposits from treatment as brokered deposits.\u201d The proposed rule would also establish an application and reporting process with respect to the primary purpose exception.\nAs of December 31, 2019, total capital was $7.2 billion, a decrease of $484 million, or 6.33 percent, from December 31, 2018.

The Bank also recognizes significant improvements in expected cash flows related to other-than-temporary impairment securities through net interest income as an adjustment to the yield on the investment securities.\nThe Bank's exposure to advances, investment securities, and consolidated obligation bonds with interest rates indexed to LIBOR as of December 31, 2019 is set forth below (in millions).\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Prime\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Alt-A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Ratings:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BB\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>B\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCC\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CC\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>D\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrated\n</td> <td>422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>423\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total unpaid principal balance\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>958\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortized cost\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>835\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross unrealized losses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other-than-temporary impairment (Year-to-date):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other-than-temporary impairment losses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net amount of impairment losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net impairment losses recognized in earnings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average percentage of fair value to unpaid principal balance\n</td> <td>93.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Original weighted average credit support\n</td> <td>10.38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average credit support\n</td> <td>5.16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average collateral delinquency\n</td> <td>10.79\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.07\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSupplementary financial data on the Bank's mortgage loans is set forth under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Supplementary Financial Information (Unaudited).\n(1) Does not include discount notes and contractual interest payments related to bonds.

financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments and assumptions that affect the Bank's reported results and disclosures. Several of the Bank's accounting policies are inherently subject to valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments and are more critical than others to the Bank's results. The Bank considers fair value measurements and derivatives and hedging activities to be critical accounting policies because they require management's subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its judgments and estimates on current market conditions and industry practices, historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.

a timely and cost-efficient manner. The Bank's objective is to meet operational and member liquidity needs under all reasonable economic and operational situations. The Bank uses liquidity to absorb fluctuations in asset and liability balances and to provide an adequate reservoir of funding to support attractive and stable advance pricing.

As of December 31, 2019, DnB Bank ASA was the only counterparty that had greater than 10 percent of the total unsecured credit exposure to non-U.S. government or non-U.S. government agencies counterparties. DnB Bank ASA had 11.0 percent of the total unsecured credit exposure to non-U.S. government or non-U.S. government agencies counterparties. As of December 31, 2019, this unsecured credit portfolio consisted primarily of federal funds sold with overnight maturities.\nThe following table presents information, based on investment ratings, on the Bank's private-label MBS as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in millions). \nThe Bank is focused on maintaining an adequate liquidity balance and a funding balance between its financial assets and financial liabilities and the FHLBanks work collectively to manage the system-wide liquidity and funding needs. Management and the FHLBanks jointly monitor the combined refinancing risk primarily by tracking the maturities of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Bank monitors the funding balance between financial assets and financial liabilities and is committed to prudent risk management practices. In managing and monitoring the amounts of assets that require refunding, the Bank considers contractual maturities of its financial assets, as well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e. estimated prepayments and scheduled amortizations). External factors including Bank member borrowing needs, supply and demand in the debt markets, and other factors may also affect the liquidity balances and the funding balance between financial assets and financial liabilities. See the notes to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements for more information regarding contractual maturities of certain of the Bank's financial assets and liabilities.\nTable 174: <table><tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Significant Inputs - Weighted Average (%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Classification of Securities (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Prepayment Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Default Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loss Severities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current Credit Enhancement (%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.56\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alt-A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.80\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.70\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinance Agency regulations establish criteria for four capital classifications, based on the amount and type of capital held by an FHLBank, as follows:\nCFTC No-action Relief for LIBOR Amendments. On December 17, 2019, three divisions of the CFTC issued no-action letters to provide relief with respect to the transition away from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates (IBORs). Among other forms of relief, the letters, subject to certain limitations, (i) permit registered swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap participants, and major security-based swap participants (covered swap entities) to amend an uncleared swap entered into before the compliance date of the CFTC's uncleared swap margin requirements (such swap, a legacy swap, and such requirements, the CFTC margin rules) to include LIBOR or other IBOR fallbacks without the legacy swap becoming subject to the CFTC margin rules; and (ii) provide time-limited relief, until December 31, 2021, for (a) swaps that are not subject to the central clearing requirement because they were executed prior to the relevant compliance date and (b) swaps that are subject to the trade execution requirement to be amended to include LIBOR or other IBOR fallbacks without becoming subject to such clearing or trade execution requirements.\nDeposits\n \u2022 the Bank's outstanding commitments arising from standby letters of credit.  Should an FHLBank be unable to satisfy its payment obligation under a consolidated obligation for which it is the primary obligor, any of the other FHLBanks, including the Bank, could be called upon to repay all or any part of such payment obligation, as determined or approved by the Finance Agency. As of December 31, 2019, none of the other FHLBanks defaulted on their consolidated obligations; the Finance Agency was not required to allocate any obligation among the FHLBanks; and no amount of the joint and several obligation was fixed. Accordingly, the Bank has not recognized a liability for its joint and several obligations related to other FHLBanks' consolidated obligations as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the FHLBanks had $1.0 trillion in aggregate par value of consolidated obligations issued and outstanding, $140.8 billion of which was attributable to the Bank. No FHLBank has ever defaulted on its principal or interest payments under any consolidated obligation, and the Bank has never been required to make payments under any consolidated obligation as a result of the failure of another FHLBank to meet its obligations.\nResults of Operations\nThe Bank seeks to manage the credit risk associated with the MPP and the MPF Program by maintaining underwriting and eligibility standards and structuring possible losses into several layers to be shared with the PFIs.\nThe legislative and regulatory environment in which the Bank and its members operate continues to evolve as a result of regulations enacted pursuant to the Housing Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bank's business operations, funding costs, rights, obligations, and/or the environment in which the Bank carries out its housing finance and community lending mission are likely to continue to be significantly impacted by these changes.

The Bank generally is required to post or collect collateral on uncleared derivative transactions. The amount of net unsecured credit exposure that is permissible with respect to each counterparty depends on the credit rating of that counterparty. A counterparty must deliver collateral to the Bank if the total market value of the Bank's exposure to that counterparty rises above a specific trigger point. As a result of these risk mitigation initiatives, the Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its uncleared derivatives as of December 31, 2019.\n (1) Investment amounts noted in the above table represent the carrying value and excludes related accrued interest receivable of $42 million as of December 31, 2018. \nThe increase in total investments was primarily due to the Bank positioning itself to meet new Finance Agency liquidity requirements. Additionally, the amount held in other investments will vary each day based on the Bank's liquidity needs as a result of advances demand, the earnings rates, and the availability of high quality counterparties in the federal funds market. The decrease in interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to a change in interpretation of regulatory guidance related to unsecured credit exposure.\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>One year or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After one year\nthrough three years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After three years\nthrough five years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After five years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated obligations bonds(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and post-retirement contributions(2)\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mandatorily redeemable capital stock\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Bank enters into derivatives to reduce the interest-rate risk exposure inherent in otherwise unhedged assets and funding positions and attempts to do so in the most cost-efficient manner.

Rule. On December 16, 2019, the Finance Agency published a proposed rule amending its stress testing rule, consistent with section 401 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (EGRRCPA), (i) to raise the minimum threshold to conduct periodic stress tests for entities regulated by the Finance Agency from those with consolidated assets of more than $10 billion to those with consolidated assets of more than $250 billion, (ii) to remove the requirements for FHLBanks to conduct stress tests; and (iii) remove the adverse scenario from the list of required scenarios. The proposed rule maintains the Finance Agency's discretion to require that an FHLBank with total consolidated assets below the $250 billion threshold conduct stress testing. The proposed amendments align the Finance Agency's stress testing rules with rules adopted by other financial institution regulators that implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act stress testing requirements, as amended by the EGRRCPA. The results of the Bank's most recent annual severely adverse economic conditions stress test were published to our public website, www.fhlbatl.com, on November 15, 2019. If the rule is adopted as proposed, it will eliminate these stress testing requirements for FHLBanks, unless the Finance Agency exercises its discretion to require stress testing in the future. The Bank does not expect this rule, if adopted as proposed, to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations.\nFor purposes of determining each member's LCV, the Bank estimates the current market value of all residential first mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity loans, and lines of credit pledged as collateral based on information provided by the member on its loan portfolio or on individual loans through the regular collateral reporting process. The estimated market value is discounted to account for the (1) price volatility of loans, (2) model data uncertainty, and (3) estimated liquidation and servicing costs in the event of the member's default. Market values, and thus LCVs, change monthly.

Prior period amounts do not conform to new hedge accounting guidance adopted January 1, 2019. \nNet interest income for the years presented was affected by changes in average balances (volume change) and changes in average rates (rate change) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The following table presents the extent to which volume changes and rate changes affected the Bank's interest income and interest expense (in millions). As presented in the table below, the overall change in net interest income during 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily volume related.\n____________\nFor those securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment was determined to have occurred during 2019, a summary of the significant inputs used to measure the amount of the credit loss recognized in earnings is contained in Note 8-Other-than-temporary Impairment to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements.

Under the Capital Agreement, each FHLBank allocates 20 percent of its net income each quarter to a separate restricted retained earnings account until the account balance equals at least one percent of the FHLBank's average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the previous quarter. Restricted retained earnings are not available to pay dividends and are presented separately on the Statements of Condition.\nThe Bank uses both sophisticated computer models and an experienced professional staff to measure the amount of interest-rate risk in the balance sheet, thus allowing management to monitor the risk against policy and regulatory limits. Management regularly reviews the major assumptions and methodologies used in the Bank's models and will make adjustments to the Bank's assumptions and methodologies in response to rapid changes in economic conditions.\n____________\nFinance Agency Supervisory Letter - Planning for LIBOR Phase-Out.

The Bank has established comprehensive financial and operating policies and procedures to mitigate the likelihood of loss resulting from the identified operational risks. In addition, the Bank's operational risk committee is responsible for overseeing the Bank's risk management policies, procedures, strategies, and activities related to operational risks, including overseeing the monitoring process and review of risk assessments.

Prior to September 27, 2019, the Bank assigned each borrower that is an insured depository institution or an insurance company a credit risk rating from one to 10 according to the relative amount of credit risk that such borrower poses to the Bank (one being the least amount of credit risk and 10 the greatest amount of credit risk). The Bank assigned each borrower that is not an insured depository institution or insurance company (including housing associates, community development financial institutions, and corporate credit unions), a risk level rating based on a risk matrix developed for each entity type. Each risk level rating generally corresponds to the one to 10 credit risk rating for insured depository institutions, 101 being the least amount of credit risk and 104 the greatest amount of credit risk.\nCapital\n\nIf effective duration of equity or market value of equity is approaching the boundaries of the Bank's RMP ranges, management will initiate remedial action or review alternative strategies at the next meeting of the board of directors or appropriate committee thereof.\n\nInterest-rate risk represents the risk that the aggregate market value or estimated fair value of the Bank's asset, liability, and derivative portfolios will decline as a result of interest-rate volatility or that net earnings will be affected significantly by interest-rate changes. Interest-rate risk can occur in a variety of forms including repricing risk, yield-curve risk, basis risk, and option risk. The Bank faces repricing risk whenever an asset and a liability reprice at different times and with different rates, resulting in interest-margin sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Yield-curve risk reflects the possibility that changes in the shape of the yield curve may affect the market value of the Bank's assets and liabilities differently because a liability used to fund an asset may be short-term, while the asset is long-term, or vice versa. Basis risk occurs when yields on assets and costs on liabilities are based on different bases, such as LIBOR, versus the Bank's cost of funds. Different bases can move at different rates or in different directions, which can cause erratic changes in revenues and expenses. Option risk is presented by the optionality that is embedded in some assets and liabilities. Mortgage assets represent the primary source of option risk.\n(1) For 2019, amounts reported exclude realized and unrealized gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships. Prior period amounts do not conform to new hedge accounting guidance adopted January 1, 2019.\n(1) Collateral held with respect to derivatives with member institutions when the Bank is acting as an intermediary represents the amount of eligible collateral physically held by or on behalf of the Bank or collateral assigned to the Bank, as evidenced by a written security agreement, and held by the member institution for the benefit of the Bank.\nA positive effective duration of equity or a positive effective duration gap results when the effective duration of assets is greater than the effective duration of liabilities. A negative effective duration of equity or a negative effective duration gap results when the effective duration of assets is less than the effective duration of liabilities. A positive effective duration of equity or a positive effective duration gap generally indicates that the Bank has some exposure to interest-rate risk in a rising rate environment, and a negative effective duration of equity or a negative effective duration gap generally indicates some exposure to interest-rate risk in a declining interest-rate environment. Higher effective duration numbers, whether positive or negative, indicate greater volatility of market value of equity in response to changing interest rates.\n \u2022 identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged item; \nAn assessment must be made to determine the effectiveness of qualifying hedging relationships. To make such an assessment, the Bank either uses (1) the short-cut method; or (2) the long-haul method.\nExecutive Summary\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell are considered collateralized financing arrangements and effectively represent short-term loans transacted with counterparties that the Bank considers to be of investment quality. The terms of these loans are structured such that if the fair value of the underlying securities decreases below the fair value required as collateral, the counterparty must place an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an equivalent amount of cash. If an agreement to resell is deemed to be impaired, the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the agreement is recognized in earnings. Based upon the collateral held as security, the Bank determined that no allowance for credit losses was needed for the securities purchased under agreements to resell as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe Bank's interest-rate spread was 25 basis points, 28 basis points, and seven basis points for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The decrease in interest-rate spread during 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily due to changes in interest rates that impacted interest expense related to interest-bearing liabilities more than the offsetting interest income related to interest-earning assets. Decreased advances balances in 2019, compared to 2018, also contributed to the decrease. The increase in interest-rate spread during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to the increased prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances during 2017 as previously discussed, which decreased net interest income during 2017.\nRisk Management\nDerivatives\n (2) Represents interest income or expense on derivatives included in net interest income. \n (1) For 2019, interest amounts reported for advances and consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes include realized and unrealized gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships.

In consideration of this and the Bank's policies and practices detailed above, the Bank has not established an allowance for credit losses on advances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe Bank records all derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in current-period earnings. The Bank designates derivatives as either fair-value hedging instruments or non-qualifying hedging instruments for which hedge accounting is not applied. The Bank has not entered into any cash-flow hedges as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Bank uses derivatives in its risk management program for the following purposes:\n \u2022 macro hedging of balance sheet risks. \n (1) Federal funds sold includes $175 million with BankUnited, National Association, and $425 million with Sun Trust Bank, both of which were one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2018. \n________________\nIn 2019, regulators published certain rules or issued guidance applicable to swaps:\n\n \u2022 Adequately Capitalized - FHLBank meets or exceeds both risk-based and minimum capital requirements; \nThe RMP also governs the Bank's approach to managing the above risks.

To promote compliance with the RMP, the Bank has established internal management committees to provide oversight of these risks. The Bank produces a comprehensive risk assessment report on an annual basis that is reviewed by the board of directors. In addition to the established risk appetite and the RMP, the Bank is also subject to Finance Agency regulations and policies regarding risk management.\n \u2022 market volatility; and \nThe Bank measures its potential market risk exposure in a number of ways. These include asset, liability, and equity duration analyses; and earnings forecast scenario analyses that reflect repricing gaps. The Bank establishes tolerance limits for these financial metrics and uses internal models to measure each of these risk exposures at least monthly.\nThe contractual or notional amount of derivative transactions reflects the involvement of the Bank in the various classes of financial instruments; however, the Bank's maximum credit risk with respect to derivative transactions is the estimated cost of replacing the derivative transactions if there is default, less the value of any related collateral, including initial and variation margin. In determining the maximum credit risk, the Bank considers accrued interest receivables and payables, as well as the netting requirements to net assets and liabilities.\nAdvances\nWith respect to investments, the FHLBanks were required, by December 31, 2019, to stop purchasing investments that reference LIBOR and mature after December 31, 2021. These phase-out dates do not apply to collateral accepted by the FHLBanks. The Supervisory Letter also directs the FHLBanks to update their pledged collateral certification reporting requirements by March 31, 2020 in an effort to encourage members to distinguish LIBOR-linked collateral maturing after December 31, 2021.\nUncertainty Regarding Brexit. In June 2016, the United Kingdom (the UK) voted in favor of leaving the European Union (the EU), and in March 2017, Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty was invoked, commencing a period of negotiations between the UK and the European Council for the UK's withdrawal from the EU, which was subsequently extended by the European Council members in agreement with the UK. On January 31, 2020, the UK withdrew from the EU under the European Union Withdrawal Act 2020, with a transition period to last until December 31, 2020, which period may be extended for an additional two years. During this transition period, the UK and the EU will negotiate the details of their future relationship, including what conditions will apply to EU-based entities that want to do business with the UK, and vice versa, after the transition period.\nAssessment of Hedge Effectiveness\n \u2022 Liquidity Risk - maintain sufficient liquidity and funding sources to allow the Bank to meet expected and unexpected obligations. \nMarket Risk\n(1) Economic Development and Growth Enhancement Program\nThe Bank measures interest-rate risk exposure by various methods. The primary methods used are (1) calculating the effective duration of assets, liabilities, and equity under various scenarios; and (2) calculating the theoretical market value of equity. Effective duration, normally expressed in years or months, measures the price sensitivity of the Bank's interest-bearing assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. As effective duration lengthens, market-value changes become more sensitive to interest-rate changes. The Bank employs sophisticated modeling systems to measure effective duration.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that after 2021 it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR. In response, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee to identify a set of alternative reference interest rates for possible use as market benchmarks. This committee has proposed SOFR as its recommended alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in the second quarter of 2018. SOFR is based on a broad segment of the overnight Treasury repurchase market and is intended to be a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities.\n____________\nIf the counterparty has an NRSRO rating, the net exposure after collateral is treated as unsecured credit, consistent with the Bank's RMP and Finance Agency regulations. If the counterparty does not have an NRSRO rating, the Bank requires collateral for the full amount of the exposure.\n (1) For 2019, amounts reported include realized and unrealized gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships as part of net interest income. \n(3) Amounts do not reflect collateral; see the table under Risk Management-Credit Risk-Derivatives below for a breakdown of the credit ratings of and the Bank's credit exposure to derivative counterparties, including net exposure after collateral.\nThe Bank's primary off-balance sheet commitments are as follows:\nMortgage loans purchased under the MPP and MPF Program must comply with the underwriting and eligibility standards set forth in applicable MPP guidelines or MPF guidelines. In both MPP and MPF, the Bank and PFIs share the risk of losses on mortgage loans by structuring potential losses on conventional mortgage loans into layers with respect to each master commitment and in compliance with the applicable regulations governing the purchase of mortgage loans by the Bank.\n \u2022 Reputation - recognize the importance of and advance positive awareness and perception of the Bank and its mission among key external stakeholders impacting the Bank's ability to achieve its mission. \nThe Bank records AHP assessment expense at a rate of 10 percent of income before assessment, excluding interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock.\nUnder the prior loan rule on debtor-creditor relationships, the independence of an accounting firm generally could be called into question if it or a covered person in the accounting firm received a loan from a lender that is a record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the audit client's equity securities.\u201d A covered person in the firm includes personnel on the audit engagement team, personnel in the chain of command, partners and managers who provide ten or more hours of non-audit services to the audit client, and partners in the office where the lead engagement partner practices in connection with the client. The SEC Final Rule replaced the existing ten percent bright-line test with a significant influence test similar to that referenced in other SEC rules and based on concepts applied in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 323.\n\nConsolidated obligations outstanding were primarily variable rate as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Bank often simultaneously entered into derivatives with the issuance of consolidated obligation bonds to convert the interest rates, in effect, into short-term variable interest rates, which were usually based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, 83.3 percent and 80.7 percent, respectively, of the Bank's fixed-rate consolidated obligation bonds were swapped. None of the Bank's variable-rate consolidated obligation bonds were swapped as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2019, 33.9 percent of the Bank's fixed-rate consolidated obligation discount notes were swapped and none of the Bank's fixed-rate consolidated obligation discount notes were swapped as of December 31, 2018. By March 31, 2020, the Bank will cease entering into LIBOR-based derivatives with termination dates beyond December 31, 2021.\n (3) Includes trading securities at fair value and available-for-sale securities at amortized cost. \nCertain of the Bank's uncleared derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Bank to post additional collateral with its counterparties if there is a deterioration in the Bank's credit rating. If the Bank's credit rating had been lowered from its current rating to the next lower rating, the Bank would have been required to deliver $2 million of collateral at fair value to its uncleared derivative counterparties as of December 31, 2019.\n____________\nFor discussion of the Bank's competition for advances, see Item 1, Business-Competition above. For discussion of recent regulatory activity that may have a material impact on the Bank's operations, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Legislative and Regulatory Developments. The Bank attempts to mitigate these risks through long-term strategic planning and through continually monitoring economic indicators and the external environment.\n (1) For 2019, amounts reported include realized and unrealized gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships as part of net interest income. Prior period amounts do not conform to new hedge accounting guidance adopted January 1, 2019. \n____________\n \u2022 Governance/Compliance/Legal - compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and manage other legal exposures. \nRefer to the respective footnotes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on each of the contractual obligations and commitments listed in the above table.\nNoninterest Income (Loss)\n (2) Represents the amortization or accretion of hedging fair value adjustments for both open and closed hedge positions. \n \u2022 conversion of a variable rate with a fixed component to another variable rate; and \n\nThe following table presents the Bank's advances outstanding by year of maturity and the related weighted-average interest rate (dollars in millions):\n \u2022 fixed-rate or variable-rate MBS, CMOs, and REMICs that are at rates equal to their contractual cap on the trade date and that have average lives that vary by more than six years under an assumed instantaneous interest-rate change of 300 basis points; and \nThe unrealized losses related to government-sponsored enterprise MBS are caused by interest-rate changes. Because these securities are guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, it is expected that these securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost basis. The Bank does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2019 because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality; the Bank does not intend to sell the investments; and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.\nMerger activity involving the Bank's members can impact the Bank's business outlook. As the financial industry continues to experience consolidation, our membership base may decrease, and our advance balance and other business could increase or decrease significantly depending upon the size of the financial institutions involved in the merger. While the Bank's balance sheet is designed to expand and contract based upon advance demand, the Bank's business could be affected by this merger activity, including as a result of a single event, such as the loss of a member's business due to acquisition by a non-member.\nThe Bank expects the SEC Final Rule to resolve the matters we discussed in Item 9B - Other Information in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Bank obtains collateral on advances to protect against losses, but Finance Agency regulations permit the Bank to accept only certain types of collateral. Each borrower must maintain an amount of qualifying collateral that, when discounted to the lendable collateral value (LCV), is equal to at least 100 percent of the borrower's outstanding par value of all advances and other liabilities from the Bank. The LCV is the value that the Bank assigns to each type of qualifying collateral for purposes of determining the amount of credit that such qualifying collateral will support. For each type of qualifying collateral, the Bank discounts the market value of the qualifying collateral to calculate the LCV. The Bank regularly reevaluates the appropriate level of discounting. The Bank had rights to collateral on a borrower-by-borrower basis with an estimated value equal to or greater than its outstanding extension of credit as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The following table presents information about the types of collateral held for the Bank's advances (dollars in millions).\nUnder the Bank's financial management policy, the Bank targets to maintain (1) a capital-to-assets ratio of 4.50 percent to 5.00 percent; (2) a retained earnings account balance equal to the restricted retained earnings account balance, plus extremely stressed scenario losses; and (3) unrestricted retained earnings greater than the retained earnings target. The Bank believes that daily excess stock repurchases and consistent dividends give members greater certainty of a return of their principal or the receipt of a dividend, which in turn may have a positive impact on members' appetite for advances. The Bank seeks to pay an amount of dividends each quarter that are consistent with an attractive rate of return on capital to its member shareholders\nCredit Risk\nThe Bank also evaluates each debt issuance, advance made, and financial instrument purchased to determine whether the cash item contains embedded derivatives that meet the criteria for bifurcation. If, after evaluation, it is determined that an embedded derivative must be bifurcated, the Bank will measure the fair value of the embedded derivative.\nValuation models and their underlying assumptions are based on the best estimates of the Bank's management with respect to:\nsubject to the prudential margin rules in the event that they are amended due to certain life-cycle activities, such as reductions of notional amounts or portfolio compression exercises.\nOn October 24, 2019, the CFTC proposed an amendment to its CFTC margin rules, which among other changes, would similarly extend the phase-in compliance date for initial margin requirements from September 1, 2020 to September 1, 2021 for counterparties with an AANA of non-cleared swaps from $8 billion to $50 billion. The Bank does not expect this rule, if adopted as proposed, to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. The Bank also believes the provisions of the rule related to LIBOR replacement, if adopted as proposed, may assist in the market's and the Bank's transition away from LIBOR.\nThe primary goal of the Bank's interest-rate risk measurement and management efforts is to control the above risks through prudent asset-liability management strategies so that the Bank may provide members with dividends that are consistently competitive with existing market interest rates on alternative short-term and variable-rate investments. The Bank attempts to manage interest-rate risk exposure by using appropriate funding instruments and hedging strategies. Hedging may occur at the micro level, for one or more specifically identified transactions, or at the macro level. Management evaluates the Bank's macro hedge position and funding strategies on a daily basis and makes adjustments as necessary.\n \u2022 the yield on variable-rate assets held by the Bank increases; \nThe Bank accounts for any ineffectiveness for all long-haul fair-value hedges using the dollar offset method. In the case of non-qualifying hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Bank reports only the change in the fair value of the derivative. Both the net interest on the derivative and the fair value adjustments of a non-qualifying hedge are recorded in noninterest income (loss) as Net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d on the Statements of Income. Beginning January 1, 2019, the Bank adopted new hedge accounting guidance, which, among other things, impacts the presentation of gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities for qualifying hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that are effective as, and that are designated and qualify as, a fair-value hedge, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk (including changes that reflect losses or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in net interest income in the same line as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Prior to January 1, 2019, any hedge ineffectiveness (which represented the amount by which the change in the fair value of the derivative differed from the change in the fair value of the hedged item) was recorded in noninterest income (loss) as Net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d on the Statements of Income.\nFinance Agency regulations prohibit the Bank from investing in any of the following securities:\nAccounting for Ineffectiveness and Hedge De-designation\nThe Bank only enters into investments with U.S. counterparties or U.S. branch offices of foreign banks that have been approved by the Bank through its internal approval process, but the Bank may still have exposure to foreign entities if a counterparty's parent entity is located in another country. The following tables present the Bank's gross exposure, by instrument type, according to the location of the parent company of the counterparty (in millions).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 debt instruments that are not of investment quality, other than certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities and instruments that the Bank determined became less than investment quality because of developments or events that occurred after purchase by the Bank; \nIn general, borrowers with the greatest amount of credit risk may have more restrictions on the types of collateral they may use to secure advances, may be required to maintain higher collateral maintenance levels and deliver loan collateral, may be restricted from obtaining further advances, and may face more stringent collateral reporting requirements. At times, based upon the Bank's assessment of a borrower and its collateral, the Bank may place more restrictive requirements on a borrower than those generally applicable to borrowers with the same rating. Management and the board also monitor the Bank's concentration in secured credit and standby letters of credit exposure to individual borrowers.\nThe Bank does not expect the Business Resiliency AB to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations.\nSecurities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell\n\nRefer to Note 19-Commitments and Contingencies to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements for more information about the Bank's outstanding standby letters of credit.\nManagement continues to be focused and engaged on implementing an effective transition away from LIBOR. Many of the Bank's assets and liabilities are indexed to LIBOR, and many of the Bank's derivative transactions are also indexed to LIBOR. In 2019, the Bank began engaging in Overnight Index Swap (OIS) and SOFR-based derivative transactions. There are complexities, risks and uncertainties involved with transitioning to alternative rates, and the transition involves considerable time and resources, all of which can impact the Bank's business outlook.\nThe long-haul method of effectiveness is used to assess effectiveness for hedging relationships that qualify for hedge accounting but do not meet the criteria for the use of the short-cut method. The long-haul method requires separate valuations of both the hedged item and the hedging instrument. If the hedging relationship is determined to be highly effective, the change in fair value of the hedged item related to the designated risk is recognized in current period earnings in the same period as the change in fair value of the hedging instrument. If the hedging relationship is determined not to be highly effective, hedge accounting will either not be allowed or cease at that point. The Bank performs effectiveness testing on a monthly basis and uses statistical regression analysis techniques to determine whether a long-haul hedging relationship is highly effective.\n \u2022 Significantly Undercapitalized - FHLBank has less than 75 percent of one or both of its risk-based or minimum capital requirements; and \nCommitments to extend credit, including standby letters of credit, are agreements to lend. The Bank issues a standby letter of credit on behalf of a member in exchange for a fee. A member may use these standby letters of credit to facilitate a financing arrangement. Management regularly reviews its standby letter of credit pricing in light of several factors, including the Bank's potential liquidity needs related to draws on its standby letters of credit. Based on management's credit analyses and collateral requirements, the Bank does not deem it necessary to have an allowance for credit losses for these unfunded standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2019.\n \u2022 the Bank's joint and several liability for all FHLBank consolidated obligations; and \nThe following table presents the Bank's market value of equity measurements as calculated in accordance with Bank policy (in millions). \nThese assumptions, particularly estimates of market indices and discount rates, may have a significant effect on the reported fair values of assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and the income and expense related thereto. The use of different assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could result in a materially different net income and retained earnings. The assumptions used in the models are corroborated by and independently verified against market observable data where possible.\nThe Bank recorded net income of $367 million for 2019, a decrease of $49 million, or 11.9 percent, from net income of $416 million for 2018. Net interest income attributed $26 million of this decrease. Net interest income was $535 million for 2019, compared to $561 million for 2018.\n\nThe Finance Agency regulations prohibit an FHLBank from purchasing MBS and asset-backed securities if its investment in such securities would exceed 300 percent of the FHLBank's previous month-end regulatory capital on the day it would\n (1) The down 200 basis points\u201d scenarios shown above are considered to be constrained shocks,\u201d intended to prevent the possibility of negative interest rates when a designated low rate environment exists. \nMortgage Loans Held for Portfolio\nFair Value Measurements\nIf the hedging instrument is a swap and meets specific criteria, the hedging relationship may qualify for the short-cut method of assessing effectiveness. The short-cut method allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness, which means that the change in the fair value of the hedged item is assumed to be equal and offsetting to the change in fair value of the hedging instrument. For periods beginning after May 31, 2005, the Bank determined that it would no longer apply the short-cut method to new hedging relationships.\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the Bank's audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2019 included in Item 8 of this Report. Readers also should carefully review Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a description of the forward-looking statements in this Report and a discussion of the factors that might cause the Bank's actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from these forward-looking statements.\nContractual Obligations\n \u2022 Operational Risk - (1) manage the key risks associated with operational availability of critical systems and services, the integrity and security of the Bank's information, and the alignment of technology investment with key business objectives through enterprise-wide risk management practices and governance based on industry standards; (2) deliver an employee value proposition that allows the Bank to build, retain, engage, and develop staff to meet the evolving needs of the Bank's key stakeholders and effectively manage enterprise-wide risks; and (3) manage the key risks associated with cyber security threats. \n \u2022 Mission/Business Model - (1) deliver financial services and consistent access to affordable funds that are the size and structure shareholders desire, helping them to manage risk and extend credit in their communities, while achieving the Bank's affordable housing mission goals; and (2) provide value through the consistent payment of dividends and the repurchasing of excess stock. \nFrom time to time the Bank may have exposure to UK-based and EU-based counterparties. At this time it is not possible to predict the date on which the transition period will end or whether any agreement reached between the UK and the EU will have a material adverse effect on the financial instruments governing the contractual terms with these counterparties.\nSupervisory Letter (Supervisory Letter) to the FHLBanks that the Finance Agency stated is designed to ensure the FHLBanks\n____________\nThe prepayment risk in both advances and investment assets can significantly affect the Bank's effective duration of equity and effective duration gap. Current regulations require the Bank to mitigate advance prepayment risk by establishing prepayment fees that make the Bank financially indifferent to a borrower's decision to prepay an advance that carries a rate above current market rates unless the advance contains explicit par value prepayment options. The Bank's prepayment fees for advances without embedded options are generally based on the present value of the difference between the rate on the prepaid advance and the current rate on an advance with an identical maturity date. Prepayment fees for advances that contain embedded options are generally based on the inverse of the market value of the derivative instrument that the Bank used to hedge the advance.\n \u2022 As an asset-liability management tool, for which hedge accounting is not applied (non-qualifying hedge). The Bank may enter into derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the Bank recognizes the change in fair value and interest income or expense of these derivatives in the Noninterest income (loss)\u201d section of the Statements of Income as Net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d with no offsetting fair-value adjustments of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitment. Consequently, these transactions can introduce earnings volatility. \nral derivative counterparties. The parent companies of the clearing agents are monitored through annual reviews, as well as through the Bank's daily monitoring tools, which include reviewing equity triggers, debt triggers, and credit default swap spread triggers. In addition, exposures to the clearing agents are monitored daily on a swap counterparty report. The Bank currently has the following three approved clearing agents: Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, and Goldman Sachs & Co. The Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its cleared derivatives as of December 31, 2019.\n\nThe unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans was $297 million and $361 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans was $1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe following discussion and analysis relates to the Bank's financial condition as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. This section explains the changes in certain key items in the Bank's financial statements from year to year, the primary factors driving those changes, the Bank's risk management processes and results, known trends or uncertainties that the Bank believes may have a material effect on the Bank's future performance, as well as how certain accounting principles affect the Bank's financial statements. For a discussion on the comparison between the results of operations for the years ended 2018 and 2017, see the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which are contained in the Bank's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 7, 2019.\n \u2022 the financial services industry or the Bank's competitive environment; and \nThe increase in net interest income during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to increased prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances during 2017. These prepayments resulted in $307 million of accelerated amortization during 2017. This accelerated amortization reduced net interest income and was offset by a corresponding increase in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities, reflected in noninterest income. The 2017 prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances primarily relate to a single member institution. The remaining change in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in interest rates, which impacted interest-earning assets more than the offsetting increase in consolidated obligation expense.\nThe Bank's RMP permits the Bank to invest in U.S. agency (i.e., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) obligations including the following: (1) CMOs and REMICS that are backed by such securities; and (2) other MBS, CMOs, and REMICS that are of sufficient investment quality, which typically have the highest credit ratings issued by S&P or Moody's at the time of purchase. The private-label MBS purchased by the Bank originally attained their triple-A ratings through credit\nOne way in which the Bank analyzes its performance is by comparing its annualized return on equity (ROE) to three-month average LIBOR. The Bank has chosen to measure ROE as a spread to average three-month LIBOR because the Bank has significant assets and liabilities priced to average three-month LIBOR. The Bank's ROE was 5.09 percent for 2019, compared to 5.54 percent for 2018. This decrease in ROE was primarily due to the decrease in net income during the year. ROE spread to average three-month LIBOR was 276 basis points for 2019, compared to 323 basis points for 2018. This decrease in the ROE spread to three-month average LIBOR was primarily due to the decrease in ROE.\nThe Bank's lending, investment and funding activities, and use of derivative hedge instruments expose the Bank to a number of risks. A robust risk management framework aligns risk-taking activities with the Bank's strategies and risk appetite. A risk management framework also balances risks and rewards. The Bank's risk management framework consists of risk governance, risk appetite, and risk management policies.\nResults of Operations\n \u2022 market indices (primarily LIBOR and the OIS curve); \n\nThe following table presents more detailed information regarding investments held by the Bank (dollars in millions).\nThe Bank generally requires standby letters of credit to contain language permitting the Bank, upon annual renewal dates and prior notice to the beneficiary, to choose not to renew the standby letter of credit, which effectively terminates the standby letter of credit prior to its scheduled final expiration date. Based on the creditworthiness of the member applicant and appropriate additional fees, the Bank may issue standby letters of credit that have terms of longer than one year without annual renewals or that have no stated maturity and are subject to renewal on an annual basis.\n \u2022 whole mortgages or other whole loans, other than the following: (1) those acquired under the Bank's mortgage purchase programs; (2) certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities; (3) certain marketable direct obligations of state, local, or tribal government units or agencies that are of investment quality; (4) MBS or asset-backed securities that are backed by manufactured housing loans or home equity loans; and (5) certain foreign housing loans that are authorized under section 12(b) of the FHLBank Act; \nIf this rule is adopted as proposed, the Bank does not expect it to materially affect its financial condition or results of operations.

As a result of the volume of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest-rate risk component of market risk has the greatest impact on the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislative and Regulatory Developments\n____________\nAs of December 31, 2019, total assets were $149.9 billion, a decrease of $4.6 billion, or 2.99 percent, from December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to an $11.3 billion, or 10.4 percent, decrease in advances which was due to maturities that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2019 and a decrease in members' liquidity needs. The decrease was partially offset by a $6.3 billion, or 14.2 percent, increase in total investments.\n \u2022 non-U.S. dollar denominated securities. \nThe majority of the Bank's assets and liabilities are, and will continue to be, monetary in nature. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or to the same extent, as the prices of goods and services, higher rates of inflation generally result in corresponding increases in interest rates. Inflation, coupled with increasing interest rates, generally has the following effects on the Bank:\nFair values play an important role in the valuation of certain assets, liabilities, and hedging transactions of the Bank. Fair values are based on quoted market prices or market-based prices, if such prices are available, even in situations in which trading volume may be low when compared with prior periods. If quoted market prices or market-based prices are not available, the Bank determines fair values based on valuation models that use discounted cash flows, using market estimates of interest rates and volatility.\nInterest-rate Risk Exposure Measurement\n____________\n____________\n \u2022 the cost of the Bank's funds and operating overhead increases; \nRefer to Note 18-Estimated Fair Values to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements for further discussion regarding how the Bank measures financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value.\n \u2022 other factors, including default and loss rates. \nFinancial Condition\nPortions of the Liquidity Guidance AB were implemented on December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, with full implementation to take place on December 31, 2019. The Bank has increased the amount of liquid assets it holds to meet the December 31, 2019 implementation date of this guidance.\nThe Bank continues to evaluate the potential impact of the Supervisory Letter on its financial condition and results of operations, but the Bank has begun to change its investment strategy, may experience lower overall demand or increased costs for its advances, and it may be necessary to change the Bank's hedging strategy, all of which in turn may negatively impact the future composition of the Bank's balance sheet, capital stock levels, core mission asset ratio, net income and dividend.\n____________\n____________\nThe Supervisory Letter provides that the FHLBanks should, by March 31, 2020, cease entering into new LIBOR referenced\nThe Bank's business and the demand for advances from the Bank are generally not subject to the effects of cyclical or seasonal variations, although the Bank's advance demand may vary based upon fluctuations of its members' consumer credit liquidity needs.\nFinancial Condition\n____________\nrelative to an established benchmark, LIBOR, after providing for retained earnings as discussed above. Historically, the Bank's dividend rate has increased with increases in LIBOR, while the spread between the dividend rate and LIBOR may shrink. Conversely, the dividend rate may decrease during periods of lower LIBOR, while the spread may increase. The Bank's ability to maintain dividends consistent with its recent trend depends on LIBOR remaining relatively stable, the Bank's actual financial performance, its ability to maintain adequate retained earnings, other factors described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and the discretion of the Bank's board of directors. Information about dividends paid by the Bank during 2019, 2018, and 2017, is contained in Note 14-Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements.\nUnder the Bank's RMP, the Bank's market value of equity must not decline by more than 15 percent, assuming an immediate, parallel, and sustained interest-rate shock of 200 basis points in either direction.\nlimiting the types of MBS the Bank may own to those with defined estimated average life changes under specific interest-rate shock scenarios. These limits do not apply to mortgage loans purchased from members. The Bank typically hedges mortgage prepayment uncertainty by using callable debt as a funding source and by using interest-rate cap, floor, and swaption transactions. The Bank also uses derivatives to reduce effective duration and option risks for investment securities other than MBS. Effective duration and option risk exposures are measured on a regular basis for all investment assets under alternative rate scenarios.\n___________\nThe Bank maintained continual access to funding and adapted its debt issuance to meet the needs of its members throughout 2019. The Bank's short-term funding was generally driven by member demand and was achieved through the issuance of consolidated discount notes and short-term consolidated bonds throughout 2019. Access to short-term debt markets has been reliable because investors, driven by increased liquidity preferences and risk aversion, including the effects of money market fund reform, have sought the Bank's short-term debt as an asset of choice, which has led to advantageous funding opportunities and increased utilization of debt maturing in one year or less.\nThe following tables present information on the credit ratings of, and the Bank's credit exposure to, its derivative counterparties (in millions). The credit ratings reflect the lowest long-term credit rating by an NRSRO.\nThe Bank establishes a credit limit for each borrower. The credit limit is not a committed line of credit, but rather an indication of the borrower's general borrowing capacity with the Bank. The Bank determines the credit limit in its sole and absolute discretion by evaluating a wide variety of factors that indicate the borrower's overall creditworthiness. The credit limit is generally expressed as a percentage equal to the ratio of the borrower's total liabilities to the Bank (including the face amount of outstanding standby letters of credit, the par value of outstanding advances, and the total exposure of the Bank to the borrower under any derivative contract) to the borrower's total assets. Generally, borrowers are held to a credit limit of no more\nNoninterest Expense and AHP Assessment\n \u2022 instruments issued by non-United States entities, other than those issued by United States branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks; \nFinance Agency regulations do not permit the Bank to rely exclusively on Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) ratings with respect to its investments. The Bank is required to make a determination of whether a security is of investment quality based on its own documented analysis, which includes the NRSRO rating as one of the factors that is assessed to determine investment quality. The Bank monitors the financial condition of investment counterparties to ensure that they are in compliance with the Bank's RMP and Finance Agency regulations. Unsecured credit exposure to any counterparty is limited by the credit quality and capital of the counterparty and by the capital of the Bank. On a regular basis, management produces financial monitoring reports detailing the financial condition of the Bank's counterparties. These reports are reviewed by the Bank's board of directors. In addition to the Bank's RMP and regulatory requirements, the Bank may limit or suspend overnight and term trading. Limiting or suspending counterparties limits the pool of available counterparties, shifts the geographical distribution of counterparty exposure, and may reduce the Bank's overall investment opportunities.\n\nThe Bank funds its assets primarily through the issuance of consolidated obligation bonds and consolidated obligation discount notes. The decrease in consolidated obligations from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 was primarily a result of the decrease in advances outstanding during the year. Consolidated obligation issuances financed 93.9 percent of the $149.9 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2019, remaining relatively stable compared to the financing ratio of 94.0 percent as of December 31, 2018.\n\nSecured advances to member financial institutions account for the largest category of Bank assets; thus, advances are a major source of the Bank's credit risk exposure. The Bank uses a risk-focused approach to credit and collateral underwriting. The Bank attempts to reduce credit risk on advances by monitoring the financial condition of borrowers and the quality and value of the assets that borrowers pledge as eligible collateral.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u2022 residual-interest or interest-accrual classes of CMOs and REMICs; \n (4) Includes only those gains or losses on trading securities or financial instruments held at fair value that have an economic derivative assigned;\u201d therefore, this line item may not agree to the income statement. \nLiquidity Reserves for Deposits. Finance Agency regulations require the Bank to hold a total amount of cash, obligations of the U.S., and advances with maturities of less than five years, in an amount not less than the amount of total member deposits. The Bank has complied with this requirement throughout 2019.\n____________\nRefer to Note 6-Available-for-sale Securities and Note 7-Held-to-maturity Securities to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements for information on securities with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n \u2022 Undercapitalized - FHLBank does not meet one or both of its risk-based or minimum capital requirements; \nThe Bank's business model continues to be focused on enhancing the total value of the cooperative for its members by serving as their trusted advisor. The Bank focuses these efforts on offering readily available, competitively priced advances, a potential return on investment, support for community investment activities, and other credit and noncredit products and services. As part of the Bank's cooperative structure, the Bank has chosen to operate with narrow margins, passing on its low funding costs to members, which causes the Bank's profitability to be sensitive to changes in market conditions.\n (5) Amount in Other\u201d includes the price alignment amount on derivatives for which variation margin is characterized as daily settled contract. \n____________\n (3) Includes only those gains or losses on trading securities or financial instruments held at fair value that have an economic derivative assigned;\u201d therefore, this line item may not agree to the income statement. \nAdditional Liquidity Guidance. On August 23, 2018, the Finance Agency issued a final Advisory Bulletin on FHLBank liquidity (Liquidity Guidance AB) that communicates the Finance Agency's expectations with respect to the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to enable the Bank to provide advances and standby letters of credit for members during a sustained capital market disruption, assuming no access to capital markets and assuming renewal of all maturing advances for a period of between ten to thirty calendar days. Contemporaneously with the issuance of the Liquidity Guidance AB, the Finance Agency issued a supervisory letter that identifies initial thresholds for measures of liquidity within the established ranges set forth in the Liquidity Guidance AB.\nAs discussed above, net interest income includes components of hedging activity. When hedging relationships qualify for hedge accounting, the interest components of the hedging derivatives will be reflected in interest income or expense. Beginning on January 1, 2019, the fair value gains and losses of derivatives and hedged items designated in fair value hedge relationships are also recognized in interest income or interest expense. Prior to January 1, 2019, the portion of fair value gains and losses of derivatives and hedged items representing hedge ineffectiveness were recorded in noninterest income. When a hedging relationship is discontinued, the cumulative fair value adjustment on the hedged item will be amortized into interest income or expense over the remaining life of the asset or liability. The impact of hedging on net interest income was a decrease of $31 million and $91 million, during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n (2) Federal funds sold includes $100 million with BankUnited, National Association, one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2019, and includes $175 million with BankUnited, National Association, and $425 million with SunTrust Bank, both of which were one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2018. \nThe following table presents the payment due dates or expiration terms of the Bank's long-term contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019 (in millions).\nThe Bank faces the following two basic types of liquidity risk: operational and contingent. The Bank maintains operational and contingent liquidity in compliance with regulatory requirements and performs a supplemental analysis to confirm that the Bank has sufficient liquidity reserves, as discussed in further detail in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources above.\nBelow is a more specific discussion of how the Bank manages its market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk, and business risk within this risk management and appetite framework.\nAdvances outstanding as of December 31, 2019 decreased by 10.4 percent, compared to December 31, 2018. As a result of shareholder demand, the majority of new advances in 2019 were short-term advances. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, 64.6 percent and 59.6 percent, respectively, of the Bank's advances were fixed rate. However, the Bank often simultaneously entered into derivatives with the issuance of advances to convert the rates, in effect, into short-term variable interest rates, the majority of which were based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, 46.7 percent and 45.3 percent, respectively, of the Bank's fixed-rate advances were swapped, and 2.03 percent and 0.47 percent, respectively, of the Bank's variable-rate advances, which contained optionality, were swapped. The majority of the Bank's variable-rate advances were indexed to LIBOR. By March 31, 2020, the Bank will cease issuing LIBOR-based advances and entering into LIBOR-based derivatives with maturities/termination dates beyond December 31, 2021. The Bank also offers variable-rate advances that may be tied to indices such as the federal funds rate, prime rate, SOFR, or constant maturity swap rates.\nFinance Agency regulations require the Bank to perform annual stress tests under various scenarios and publicly disclose a summary of the stress test results for the severely adverse scenario. The Bank filed the results of its stress test with the Finance Agency on August 27, 2019, and publicly disclosed a summary of the adverse scenario results on November 15, 2019.\nCFTC Advisory on Initial Margin Documentation Requirements. On July 9, 2019, the CFTC issued an advisory (the CFTC Advisory) on its Margin Requirements for Uncleared Swaps for Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants (the CFTC Margin Rules), to clarify that documentation governing the posting, collection, and custody of initial margin is not required to be completed until such time as the aggregate unmargined exposure to a counterparty (and its margin affiliates) exceeds an initial margin threshold of $50 million imposed by the regulation. The CFTC Advisory, however, instructs covered swap entities to closely monitor initial margin amounts if they are approaching the $50 million initial margin threshold with a counterparty and to take appropriate steps to ensure that the required documentation is in place at such time as the threshold is reached. The Bank is closely monitoring its initial margin thresholds on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis and is evaluating the impact of the CFTC Advisory on its documentation requirements.\nGeneral\nTransition of LIBOR to an Alternative Reference Rate\nNet Interest Income\nOperational Liquidity. In order to ensure adequate operational liquidity (generally, the ready cash and borrowing capacity available to meet the Bank's intraday needs) each day, Bank policy establishes a daily liquidity target based upon member deposit levels and current day liability maturities and asset settlements. The Bank met this liquidity requirement throughout 2019.\n (5) Amount in Other\u201d includes the price alignment amount on derivatives for which variation margin is characterized as daily settled contract. \nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance\nThe following tables present the net effect of derivatives and hedging activity on the Bank's results of operations (in millions):\nAs part of the Bank's risk LIBOR exposure evaluation and risk management, the Bank is developing an inventory of financial instruments impacted by the LIBOR transition and working to identify contracts that may require adding or adjusting the fallback language. The Bank has added or adjusted fallback language in advance confirmations, consolidated obligations and its credit and collateral policy to include fallback language addressing the discontinuation of LIBOR as a benchmark rate. The Bank continues to monitor the market-wide efforts to address fallback language related to derivatives and cash products.\npurchase the securities. As of December 31, 2019, these investments were 309 percent of the Bank's regulatory capital. These investments exceeded the 300 percent level due to a decrease in regulatory capital that resulted from a decrease in advances. The Bank was in compliance with this regulatory requirement at the time of its MBS purchases and will not be required to sell any previously purchased MBS. However, the Bank was precluded from purchasing additional MBS until its MBS to regulatory capital declines below 300 percent. As of December 31, 2018, the Banks MBS to regulatory capital was 290 percent of regulatory capital.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nThe Bank's board of directors and management have established a risk appetite statement and risk metrics for controlling and escalating actions based on the following eight continuing objectives that represent the foundation of the Bank's strategic and tactical planning:\n\n (2) Represents the amortization or accretion of hedging fair value adjustments for both open and closed hedge positions. \nSources of Liquidity. The Bank's principal source of liquidity is consolidated obligation debt instruments. To provide additional liquidity, the Bank also may use other short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and loans from other FHLBanks. The Bank's consolidated obligations are not obligations of the United States and are not guaranteed by either the United States or any government agency, but have historically received the same credit rating as the government bond credit rating of the United States. As a result, the Bank generally has comparatively stable access to funding through a diverse investor base at relatively favorable spreads to U.S. Treasury rates. The Bank's income and liquidity would be adversely affected if it were not able to access the capital markets at competitive rates for an extended period.\n (3) Represents interest income or expense on derivatives included in net interest income. \nThe Bank is subject to credit risk on unsecured investments, such as interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold. These investments are generally transacted with government agencies and large financial institutions that are considered to be of investment quality.\nThe following table presents the components of noninterest income (loss) (dollars in millions):\nThe Bank's 10 largest borrowing member institutions had 74.4 percent of the Bank's total advances outstanding as of December 31, 2019. Further information regarding the Bank's 10 largest borrowing member institutions and breakdown of their individual advance balances as of December 31, 2019 is contained in Item 1, Business-Credit Products-Advances. Management believes that the Bank holds sufficient collateral, on a member-specific basis, to secure the advances to all borrowers, including these 10 institutions, and the Bank does not expect to incur any credit losses on these advances.\nThe Bank's interest-rate spread was 25 basis points for 2019, compared to 28 basis points for 2018. This decrease in the Bank's interest-rate spread was primarily due to changes in interest rates as discussed above, which impacted interest expense related to interest-bearing liabilities more than the offsetting interest income related to interest-earning assets. Decreased advances balances in 2019, compared to 2018, also contributed to the decrease.\n\nInvestments\nThe following table presents the number of borrowers and the par value of advances outstanding to borrowers with the specified ratings as of the specified dates (dollars in millions).\nGeneral\nOff-balance Sheet Commitments\nSee Note 3-Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting guidance.\n(2) Includes future funding contribution for the qualified pension plan and scheduled benefit payments for the nonqualified defined benefit plans.\nThe following table presents the distribution of the Bank's total assets, liabilities, and capital by major class as of the dates indicated (dollars in millions). These items are discussed in more detail below.\n \u2022 the method used for the determination of effectiveness for transactions qualifying for hedge accounting; and \nEffective duration of equity aggregates the estimated sensitivity of market value for each of the Bank's financial assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. Effective duration of equity is computed by taking the market value-weighted effective duration of assets, less the market value-weighted effective duration of liabilities, and dividing the remainder by the market value of equity. Market value of equity is not indicative of the market value of the Bank as a going concern or the value of the Bank in a liquidation scenario. An effective duration gap is the measure of the difference between the estimated effective durations of portfolio assets and liabilities and summarizes the extent to which the estimated cash flows for assets and liabilities are matched, on average, over time and across interest-rate scenarios.\nThe Bank's board of directors and management recognize that risks are inherent to the Bank's business model and that the process of establishing a risk appetite does not imply that the Bank seeks to mitigate or eliminate all risk. By defining and managing to a specific risk appetite, the board of directors and management ensure that there is a common understanding of the Bank's desired risk profile, which enhances strategic and tactical decisions. Additionally, the Bank aspires to (1) sustain a corporate culture of transparency, integrity, and adherence to legal and ethical obligations; and (2) achieve and exceed best practices in governance, ethics, and compliance.\nCertain of the Bank's assets and liabilities, and certain collateral pledged to the Bank, are indexed to LIBOR, with exposure extending past December 31, 2021. The Bank is currently evaluating and planning for the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including the possibility of SOFR as the dominant replacement. In general, the transition away from LIBOR may result in increased market risk, credit risk, operational risk and business risk for the Bank. The Bank has adopted a LIBOR transition plan, which outlines the Bank's transition activities, including LIBOR exposure evaluation, risk management, legal, operational, systems and operations, shareholder and external communication and education, and other aspects of planning. The Bank has a LIBOR Steering Committee, which oversees the Bank's transition away from LIBOR in accordance with the strategies and requirements put forth by senior management and regulatory guidance, providing periodic reports to the Bank's executive management committee and board of directors.\nThe following table presents spreads between the average yield on total interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (dollars in millions). The interest-rate spread is affected by the inclusion or exclusion of net interest income or expense associated with the Bank's derivatives. If the derivatives do not qualify for fair-value hedge accounting under GAAP, the interest income or expense associated with the derivatives is excluded from net interest income and from the calculation of interest-rate spread and is recorded in Noninterest income (loss) as Net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities.\u201d Amortization associated with some hedging-related basis adjustments is also reflected in net interest income, which affects interest-rate spread.\nMortgage Loan Programs\nThe Bank's over-the-counter derivative transactions may either be (1) uncleared derivatives, which are executed bilaterally with a counterparty; or (2) cleared derivatives, which are cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (clearing agent) with a Derivative Clearing Organization (Clearinghouse). Once a derivative transaction has been accepted for clearing by a Clearinghouse, the executing counterparty is replaced with the Clearinghouse as the counterparty.\n \u2022 Critically Undercapitalized - FHLBank total capital is two percent or less of total assets.  Under the regulations, the Director of the Finance Agency (Director) will make a capital classification for each FHLBank at least quarterly and notify the FHLBank in writing of any proposed action and provide an opportunity for the FHLBank to submit information relevant to such action. The Director is permitted to make discretionary classifications. An FHLBank must provide written notice to the Finance Agency within 10 days of any event or development that has caused or is likely to cause its permanent or total capital to fall below the level required to maintain its most recent capital classification or reclassification. In the event that an FHLBank is not adequately capitalized, the regulations delineate the types of prompt corrective actions that the Director may order, including submission of a capital restoration plan by the FHLBank and restrictions on its dividends, stock redemptions, executive compensation, new business activities, or any other actions the Director determines will ensure safe and sound operations and capital compliance by the FHLBank. On December 13, 2019, the Bank received notification from the Director that, based on September 30, 2019 data, the Bank meets the definition of adequately capitalized.\u201d\nThe Bank also analyzes its interest-rate risk and market exposure by evaluating the theoretical market value of equity. The market value of equity represents the net result of the present value of future cash flows discounted to arrive at the theoretical market value of each balance sheet item. By using the discounted present value of future cash flows, the Bank is able to factor in the various maturities of assets and liabilities, similar to the effective duration analysis discussed above. The Bank determines the theoretical market value of assets and liabilities utilizing a Level 3 pricing approach as more fully described in Note 18-Estimated Fair Values to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements. The difference between the market value of total assets and the market value of total liabilities is the market value of equity. A more volatile market value of equity under different shock scenarios tends to result in a higher effective duration of equity, indicating increased sensitivity to interest rate changes.\n (4) Includes only those gains or losses on trading securities or financial instruments held at fair value that have an economic derivative assigned;\u201d therefore, this line item may not agree to the income statement. \n (1) Volume change is calculated as the change in volume multiplied by the previous rate, while rate change is calculated as the change in rate multiplied by the previous volume. The rate/volume change, calculated as the change in rate multiplied by the change in volume, is allocated between volume change and rate change at the ratio each component bears to the absolute value of its total. \nFor disclosure purposes, the Bank classifies private-label MBS as either prime or Alt-A based upon the overall credit quality of the underlying loans as determined by the originator at the time of origination, unless otherwise noted. Although there is no universally accepted definition of Alt-A, generally, loans with credit characteristics that range between prime and subprime are classified as Alt-A. Participants in the mortgage market have used the Alt-A classification principally to describe loans for which the underwriting process has been streamlined in order to reduce the documentation requirements of the borrower or allow for alternative documentation.\nNet Income\n (2) Includes amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral paid under master netting agreements with derivative counterparties. \nBank policy requires the Bank to maintain its effective duration of equity within a range of plus five years to minus five years, assuming current interest rates, and within a range of plus seven years to minus seven years, assuming an instantaneous parallel increase or decrease in market interest rates of 200 basis points.\nLiquidity Risk\nNon-MBS Held-to-maturity Securities\n\n\nThe unrealized losses related to non-MBS held-to-maturity securities are caused by interest-rate changes. These losses are considered temporary as the Bank expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis on its non-MBS held-to-maturity securities in unrealized loss positions and neither intends to sell these securities nor considers it more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before its anticipated recovery of each security's remaining amortized cost basis. As a result, Bank does not consider these non-MBS held-to-maturity securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2019.\nThe state of the economy is a significant component in determining the Bank's overall business outlook as it impacts advance demand, asset and collateral values, member financial stability, funding costs, and many other facets of the Bank's portfolio. While the U.S. economy continued to experience growth in 2019, factors such as interest rates, liquidity levels at member institutions, fiscal and monetary policies, performance of global economies, and regulatory changes could have a significant effect either positive or negative on the Bank's financial performance.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the Bank documents the following concurrently with the execution of each hedging relationship:\nContingency plans are in place that prioritize the allocation of liquidity resources in the event of operational disruptions at the Bank or the Office of Finance. Under the FHLBank Act, the Secretary of Treasury has the authority, at his discretion, to purchase consolidated obligations up to an aggregate amount of $4.0 billion. No borrowings under this authority have been outstanding since 1977.\nSupplementary financial data on the Bank's short-term borrowings is set forth under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Supplementary Financial Information (Unaudited).\nThe Bank categorizes its financial instruments carried at fair value into a three-level classification in accordance with GAAP. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency (observable or unobservable) of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Bank's market assumptions. The Bank utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nBeginning on January 1, 2019, changes in fair value of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk for designated fair value hedges are recorded in net interest income in the same line as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Prior to January 1, 2019, for fair value hedges, any hedge ineffectiveness (which represented the amount by which the change in the fair value of the derivative differed from the change in the fair value of the hedge item) was recorded in noninterest income as net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities.\n \u2022 determination of the appropriate accounting designation; \n (1) Federal funds sold includes $100 million with BankUnited, National Association, one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2019.  (2) Interest-bearing deposits include a $508 million business money market account with Truist Bank, one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2019.\nThe FHLBank Act affords any security interest granted to the Bank by any member of the Bank, or any affiliate of any such member, priority over the claims and rights of any party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor) other than the claims and rights of a party that (1) would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law; and (2) is an actual bona fide purchaser for value or is an actual secured party whose security interest is perfected in accordance with applicable state law.\n (1) Investment amounts noted in the above table represent the carrying value and excludes related accrued interest receivable of $44 million as of December 31, 2019. \n(1) The classification of securities is based on current characteristics and performance, which may be different from the securities' classification as determined\nby the originator at the time of origination.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\n\nThe board of directors has an Enterprise Risk and Operations Committee (EROC) to advise and assist the board with respect to enterprise risk management, operations, information technology, and other related matters. In addition, the Bank's internal Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) is responsible for the management and oversight of the Bank's risk management programs and practices. Additionally, the Bank's Internal Audit department, which reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Bank's board of directors, regularly tests compliance with the policies and procedures related to managing operational risks.\nThe prepayment options embedded in mortgage loan and mortgage security assets may shorten or lengthen both the actual and expected cash flows when interest rates change. Current Finance Agency policies limit this source of interest-rate risk by\nBusiness Outlook\nInterest rates are also a significant factor on the Bank's business outlook. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates during 2017 and 2018, and then lowered interest rates during 2019. There is uncertainty as to whether rates in 2020 will move up, down, or remain stable. This uncertainty can impact the Bank's interest rate risk management, profitability, and ROE. It can also impact member advance demand, as rate uncertainty can impact deposit levels at members.\nUse of Derivatives\n \u2022 the hedging strategy; \nThe Bank is subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to its derivative transactions. The amount of credit risk on derivatives depends on the extent to which netting procedures, collateral requirements, and other credit enhancements are used and are effective in mitigating the risk. The Bank manages credit risk through credit analysis, collateral management, and other credit enhancements. The Bank is also required to follow the requirements set forth by applicable regulations.\nBusiness Risk\n (4) Nonperforming mortgage loans are included in average balances used to determine average rate. \n (2) Interest-bearing deposits include a $409 million business money market account with Branch Bank and Trust, one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2018.  (3) Amounts do not reflect collateral; see the table under Risk Management-Credit Risk-Derivatives below for a breakdown of the credit ratings of and the Bank's credit exposure to derivative counterparties, including net exposure after collateral.\n \u2022 As a fair-value hedge of an underlying financial instrument or a firm commitment. For example, the Bank uses derivatives to reduce the interest-rate net sensitivity of consolidated obligations, advances, and investments by, in effect, converting them to a short-term interest rate. The Bank also uses derivatives to manage embedded options in assets and liabilities and to hedge the market value of existing assets and liabilities. The Bank's management reevaluates its hedging strategies from time to time and may change the hedging techniques used or adopt new strategies as deemed prudent. \nbeyond 2021, the Bank has begun updating its systems, participating in the issuance of SOFR-indexed consolidated bonds, issuing SOFR-linked advances, and swapping certain financial instruments to OIS and SOFR as an alternative interest rate hedging strategy for certain financial instruments. The pace of transition, however, is dependent on external factors, including market developments and demand. The Bank closely monitors and participates in industry activity related to LIBOR transition, including those of the Alternate Reference Rate Committee and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. The Bank will update its pledged collateral certification reporting requirements as of March 31, 2020 so that members may distinguish LIBOR-linked collateral maturing past December 31, 2021. The Bank intends to utilize this information in connection with its LIBOR exposure evaluation and risk management.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Bank ceased purchasing assets tied to LIBOR with a contractual maturity beyond December 31, 2021. In light of this change, the Bank is evaluating its investment and related hedging strategy, including the availability of alternate permissible investments. In addition, beginning March 31, 2020, the Bank will cease entering into new LIBOR-based transactions involving advances, debt, derivatives, or other products with maturities beyond December 31, 2021. In preparation for this change and to help manage balance sheet exposure to LIBOR-indexed assets and liabilities with maturities\nThe Bank may discontinue hedge accounting for a hedging transaction (de-designation) if it fails effectiveness testing or for other asset-liability-management reasons. The Bank also treats modifications to hedged items as a discontinuance of a hedging relationship. When a hedging relationship is discontinued, the Bank will cease marking the hedged item to fair value and will amortize the cumulative basis adjustment resulting from hedge accounting. The Bank reports related amortization as interest income or expense over the remaining life of the associated hedged item. The associated derivative will continue to be marked to fair value through earnings until it matures or is terminated.\nThe decrease in mortgage loans held for portfolio from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the maturity and prepayments of these assets during the year.\nThe decrease in net interest income during 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in outstanding advances during 2019 compared to 2018. Additionally, changes in interest rates and their subsequent impact on the Bank's derivative positions, interest-earning assets, and interest-bearing liabilities contributed to the decrease in net interest income. These changes in interest rates impacted interest expense related to interest-bearing liabilities more that the offsetting interest income related to interest-earning assets.\n (5) Includes amounts recognized for the right to return cash collateral received under master netting agreements with derivative counterparties. \nThe Liquidity Guidance AB's measurements of liquidity include a cash flow scenario, on a daily basis, that projects forward the number of days for which the Bank should maintain positive cash balances assuming the renewal of all maturing advances and the maintenance of a liquidity reserve for outstanding standby letters of credit. The measurements of liquidity also include a funding gap measurement of the difference between assets and liabilities that are scheduled to mature during a specified period, expressed as a percentage of the Bank's total assets to reduce the liquidity risks associated with a mismatch in asset and liability maturities, including an undue reliance on short-term debt funding, which may increase debt rollover risk.\nCyber-Related Risks. The efficiencies offered by information technology (IT) are necessary components of Bank operations. The IT architecture supports multiple operating systems, database structures, and virtualized servers to support business applications that are a mixture of vendor-licensed and in-house developed. Cyber-attacks are increasing globally across all business sectors and cyber attackers are finding more ways to penetrate organizations' systems. Cybersecurity threats can result in damage to the Bank's physical facilities, technology systems, and/or the Bank's intangible assets. Successful attacks can have a financial, legal, and reputational impact on the Bank as well as disrupt the Bank's ability to serve its shareholders.\nThe decrease in total noninterest income during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to increased prepayments of restructured and redesignated advances during 2017, which resulted in $307 million of accelerated amortization during 2017. This accelerated amortization reduced net interest income during 2017 and was offset by a corresponding increase in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities. The remaining changes in derivatives and hedging activities were primarily related to changes in interest rates.\nThe Bank's board of directors, through EROC, oversees the major dimensions of the Bank's information technology program including management information systems to ensure alignment with the Bank's strategic plan, risk management activities, and operational performance standards. In that role, EROC oversees the development, implementation and maintenance of the Bank's information security program including recommending action to the board with respect to the Bank's information security policy on an annual basis and reviewing reports on the effectiveness of the Bank's information security program. The Bank's internal ERC reviews and reports to the board on the risk exposures and risk appetites of the Bank, including those related to information technology. In addition, the Bank's internal Information Technology Governance Committee oversees IT governance, including: IT risk management and IT operational performance, and the Bank's internal Security Governance Committee provides independent and integrated oversight of the information security program. Each of these committees provide information and make recommendations to the board, through the Bank's executive management committee, regarding their respective oversight authority.\n____________\nThe board and management recognize that risk and risk producing events are dynamic and constantly being presented. Accordingly, the Bank believes that reporting, analyzing, and mitigating risks are paramount to successful corporate governance.\nLiquidity is necessary to satisfy members' borrowing needs on a timely basis, repay maturing and called consolidated obligations, and meet other obligations and operating requirements. Many members rely on the Bank as a source of standby liquidity, so the Bank attempts to be in a position to meet member funding needs on a timely basis. The Bank is required to maintain liquidity in accordance with the FHLBank Act, Finance Agency regulations, and policies established by the Bank's management and board of directors. In addition, the Finance Agency, at times, has issued guidance and expectations to the FHLBanks related to liquidity.\n (3) Represents interest income or expense on derivatives included in net interest income. \nMargin and Capital Requirements for Covered Swap Entities. On November 7, 2019, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Farm Credit Administration and the Finance Agency (collectively, the Agencies) jointly published a proposed rule that, in addition to other changes, would amend the Agencies' regulations that established minimum margin and capital requirements for uncleared swaps (the prudential margin rules) for covered swap entities under the jurisdiction of one of the Agencies. In addition to other changes, the proposed amendments would permit those uncleared swaps entered into by a covered swap entity before the compliance date of the prudential margin rules to retain their legacy status and not become subject to the prudential margin rules in the event that such legacy swaps are amended to replace LIBOR or another rate that is reasonably expected to be discontinued or is reasonably determined to have lost its relevance as a reliable benchmark due to a significant impairment. Among other things, the proposed rule would also amend the prudential margin rules to (i) extend the phase-in compliance date of the covered swap entities for initial margin requirements from September 1, 2020 to September 1, 2021 for counterparties with an average daily aggregate notional amount (AANA) of non-cleared swaps from $8 billion to $50 billion, (ii) clarify that an Agency covered swap entity does not have to execute initial margin trading documentation with a counterparty prior to the time that the counterparty is required to collect or post initial margin, and (iii) permit legacy swaps to retain their legacy status and not become\n \u2022 the fair value of fixed-rate investments and mortgage loans held in portfolio decreases; and \nSupplementary financial data on the Bank's advances is set forth under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information (Unaudited).", "item_7_text": "The following is a discussion and analysis of the Bank's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nBeginning on September 27, 2019, the Bank no longer assigned each borrower that is an insurance company a credit risk rating from one to 10, and began assigning a risk level rating by utilizing an external model. The rating process for other borrowers remains unchanged.\n\n \u2022 instruments, such as common stock, that represent an ownership interest in an entity, other than stock in small business investment companies, or certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities; \nAs a result of the Supervisory Letter, beginning April 1, 2020, the Bank will no longer enter into certain structured advances and advances with terms directly linked to LIBOR that mature after December 31, 2021. In addition, beginning April 1, 2020, the Bank will no longer enter into consolidated obligation bonds and derivatives with swaps, caps, or floors indexed to LIBOR that terminate after December 31, 2021. The Bank has ceased purchasing investments that reference LIBOR and mature after December 31, 2021.\nAdvances\n \u2022 mortgage loan prepayment rates decrease and result in lower levels of mortgage loan refinance activity, which may result in the reduction of Bank advances to members as increased rates tend to slow home sales. \nThe decreases in net income and net interest income were primarily related to a decrease in outstanding advances during 2019, compared to 2018. Additionally, changes in interest rates and their subsequent impact on the Bank's derivative positions, interest-earning assets, and interest bearing liabilities contributed to the decrease in net income and net interest income during 2019. These changes in interest rates impacted interest expense related to interest-bearing liabilities more than the offsetting interest income related to interest-earning assets. The impact of derivatives and hedging activities was a reduction to net interest income of $31 million in 2019. Beginning on January 1, 2019, changes in fair value of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk for designated fair value hedges are recorded in net interest income in the same line as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Prior to January 1, 2019, for fair value hedges, any hedge ineffectiveness (which represented the amount by which the change in the fair value of the derivative differed from the change in the fair value of the hedge item) was recorded in noninterest income as net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities.\nThe Bank carries certain assets and liabilities, including investments classified as trading and available-for-sale and all derivatives, on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, representing an exit price.\n \u2022 conversion of a fixed rate to a variable rate; \nBusiness risk is the risk of an adverse effect on the Bank's profitability resulting from external factors that may occur in both the short- and the long-term. Business risk includes political, strategic, reputation, and regulatory events that are beyond the Bank's control. In particular, during 2019 and continuing into 2020, the Bank faces business risk, which may include changes in:\nFinance Agency Advisory Bulletin 2019-01 Business Resiliency Management. On May 7, 2019, the Finance Agency issued an Advisory Bulletin on Business Resiliency Management for FHLBanks and other entities regulated by the Finance Agency (the Business Resiliency AB) that communicates the Finance Agency's expectations with respect to minimizing the impact of disruptions in service from uncontrolled events and the maintenance of business operations at predefined levels. The Business Resiliency AB rescinds the Finance Agency's 2002 disaster recovery guidance. The new guidance states that a business resiliency program should guide the regulated entity to respond appropriately to disruptions affecting business operations, personnel, equipment, facilities, IT systems, and information assets. The Business Resiliency AB provides guidance on the elements of a safe and sound business resiliency program, which include governance, risk assessment and business impact analysis, risk mitigation and plan development, testing and analysis, and risk monitoring and program sustainability.\n (1) Interest-bearing deposits include a $508 million business money market account with Truist Bank and a $409 million business money market account with Branch Banking and Trust Company, one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \nSEC Final Rule on Auditor Independence with Respect to Certain Loans or Debtor-Creditor Relationships. On July 5, 2019, the SEC published a final rule, which became effective on October 3, 2019 (the SEC Final Rule), that adopts amendments to its auditor independence rules to modify the analysis that must be conducted to determine whether an auditor is independent when the auditor has a lending relationship with certain shareholders of an audit client at any time during an audit or professional engagement period. The SEC Final Rule, among other things, focuses the analysis on beneficial ownership rather than on both record and beneficial ownership; replaces the existing ten percent bright-line shareholder ownership test with a significant influence\u201d test; and adds a known through reasonable inquiry\u201d standard with respect to identifying beneficial owners of the audit client's equity securities.\n\nPrivate-label MBS\n \u2022 Credit and Concentration Risk - avoid credit losses by managing credit and collateral risk exposures within acceptable parameters. Achieve this objective through data-driven analysis (and when appropriate, perform shareholder-specific analysis), monitoring, and verification, including new collateral policy expansions to ensure appropriate controls and that monitoring is consistent with managing existing credit and collateral risk exposures. Monitor through enhanced reporting any elevated risk concentrations, and when appropriate, manage and mitigate the increased risk. \n \u2022 prepayments; \nwill be able to identify and prudently manage the risks associated with the termination of LIBOR in a safe and sound manner.\nFor cleared derivatives, the Bank is subject to credit risk due to nonperformance by the Clearinghouse and clearing agent. The requirement that the Bank post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent, to the Clearinghouse, exposes the Bank to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the Clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. The use of cleared derivatives mitigates credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties, and collateral is posted daily for changes in the value of cleared derivatives through a clearing agent. The Bank utilizes two Clearinghouses for all cleared derivative transactions, LCH Ltd. and CME Clearing. Variation margin is characterized as daily settlement payments and is netted directly against the derivative's gross recognized amount. Initial margin is considered cash collateral. Because of the limited number of Clearinghouses and clearing agents, a risk of concentration is introduced. The Bank actively monitors Clearinghouses and clearing agents. An annual review of the Bank's Clearinghouses is performed, and the Bank also monitors its exposure to Clearinghouses on a monthly basis. The Bank also monitors the clearing agents through its unsecured credit system, and the Bank subjects these clearing agents to the same limits as other bilate\nThe Bank offers demand and overnight deposit programs to members and qualifying non-members primarily as a liquidity management service. In addition, a member that services mortgage loans may deposit funds in the Bank that are collected in connection with the mortgage loans, pending disbursement of those funds to the owners of the mortgage loans. For demand deposits, the Bank pays interest at the overnight rate. Most of these deposits represent member liquidity investments, which members may withdraw on demand. Therefore, the total account balance of the Bank's deposits may fluctuate significantly. As a matter of prudence, the Bank typically invests deposit funds in liquid short-term assets. Member loan demand, deposit flows, and liquidity management strategies influence the amount and volatility of deposit balances carried with the Bank.\nFinance Agency Advisory Bulletin 2019-03 - Capital Stock Management. On August 14, 2019, the Finance Agency issued an Advisory Bulletin (the Capital Management AB) providing for each FHLBank to maintain a ratio of at least two percent of capital stock to total assets in order to help preserve the cooperative structure incentives that encourage members to remain fully engaged in the oversight of their investment in the Bank. In February 2020, the Finance Agency began to consider the proportion of capital stock to assets, measured on a daily average basis at month end, when assessing each FHLBank's capital management practices.\nCyclicality and Seasonality\nFDIC Brokered Deposits Restrictions. On December 12, 2019, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a proposed rule to amend its brokered deposits restrictions that apply to less than well capitalized insured depository institutions. The FDIC states that the proposed amendments are intended to modernize its brokered deposit regulations and would establish a new framework for analyzing whether deposits placed through deposit placement arrangements qualify as brokered deposits. These deposit placement arrangements include those between insured depository institutions and third parties, such as financial technology companies, for a variety of business purposes, including access to deposits. By creating a new framework for analyzing certain provisions of the deposit broker\u201d definition, including shortening the list of activities considered facilitating\u201d and expanding the scope of the primary purpose\u201d exception, the proposed rule would narrow the definition of deposit broker\u201d and exclude more deposits from treatment as brokered deposits.\u201d The proposed rule would also establish an application and reporting process with respect to the primary purpose exception.\nAs of December 31, 2019, total capital was $7.2 billion, a decrease of $484 million, or 6.33 percent, from December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the Bank's subclass B2 activity-based capital stock resulting from a decrease in the total outstanding advances during the year.\nEffects of Inflation\nOperational Risk\n(1) Collateral held with respect to derivatives with member institutions when the Bank is acting as an intermediary represents the amount of eligible collateral physically held by or on behalf of the Bank or collateral assigned to the Bank, as evidenced by a written security agreement, and held by the member institution for the benefit of the Bank.\nThe primary source of the Bank's earnings is net interest income. Net interest income equals interest earned on assets (including member advances, mortgage loans, MBS held in portfolio, and other investments), less the interest expense incurred on liabilities (including consolidated obligations, deposits, and other borrowings). Also included in net interest income are miscellaneous related items such as prepayment fees, the amortization of debt issuance discounts, concession fees, and certain derivative instruments and hedging activities related adjustments. The Bank also recognizes significant improvements in expected cash flows related to other-than-temporary impairment securities through net interest income as an adjustment to the yield on the investment securities.\nThe Bank's exposure to advances, investment securities, and consolidated obligation bonds with interest rates indexed to LIBOR as of December 31, 2019 is set forth below (in millions).\nSupplementary financial data on the Bank's mortgage loans is set forth under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Supplementary Financial Information (Unaudited).\n(1) Does not include discount notes and contractual interest payments related to bonds. Total is based on contractual maturities; the actual timing of payments could be impacted by factors affecting redemption.\nThe Bank believes this relief may assist in the market's and the Bank's transition away from LIBOR.\nThe preparation of the Bank's financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments and assumptions that affect the Bank's reported results and disclosures. Several of the Bank's accounting policies are inherently subject to valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments and are more critical than others to the Bank's results. The Bank considers fair value measurements and derivatives and hedging activities to be critical accounting policies because they require management's subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its judgments and estimates on current market conditions and industry practices, historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and/or conditions.\nthan 30 percent. However, the Bank's board of directors, or a relevant committee thereof, may approve a higher limit at its discretion, and such borrowers may be subject to certain additional collateral reporting and maintenance requirements. Five borrowers have been approved for a credit limit higher than 30 percent, and their total outstanding advance and standby letters of credit balance was $23.6 billion and $573 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.\n\nThe Bank's exposure to derivatives with interest rates indexed to LIBOR as of December 31, 2019 is set forth below (in millions).\nAs of December 31, 2019, total liabilities were $142.7 billion, a decrease of $4.1 billion, or 2.82 percent, from December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a $4.5 billion, or 3.10 percent, decrease in consolidated obligations as a result of lower advances balances as of December 31, 2019.\nThe Bank does not expect the Capital Management AB to have a material impact on its capital management practices, financial condition, and/or results of operations.\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Bank will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due or meet the credit needs of its members and borrowers in a timely and cost-efficient manner. The Bank's objective is to meet operational and member liquidity needs under all reasonable economic and operational situations. The Bank uses liquidity to absorb fluctuations in asset and liability balances and to provide an adequate reservoir of funding to support attractive and stable advance pricing. The Bank meets its liquidity needs from both asset and liability sources.\nThe Bank evaluates its individual investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, as described in Note 8-Other-than-temporary Impairment to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements.\nThe Bank's unsecured credit exposure in its investment portfolio related to non-U.S. government and non-U.S. government agency counterparties decreased to $13.6 billion as of December 31, 2019 from $15.7 billion as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, DnB Bank ASA was the only counterparty that had greater than 10 percent of the total unsecured credit exposure to non-U.S. government or non-U.S. government agencies counterparties. DnB Bank ASA had 11.0 percent of the total unsecured credit exposure to non-U.S. government or non-U.S. government agencies counterparties. As of December 31, 2019, this unsecured credit portfolio consisted primarily of federal funds sold with overnight maturities.\nThe following table presents information, based on investment ratings, on the Bank's private-label MBS as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in millions). \nThe Bank is focused on maintaining an adequate liquidity balance and a funding balance between its financial assets and financial liabilities and the FHLBanks work collectively to manage the system-wide liquidity and funding needs. Management and the FHLBanks jointly monitor the combined refinancing risk primarily by tracking the maturities of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Bank monitors the funding balance between financial assets and financial liabilities and is committed to prudent risk management practices. In managing and monitoring the amounts of assets that require refunding, the Bank considers contractual maturities of its financial assets, as well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e. estimated prepayments and scheduled amortizations). External factors including Bank member borrowing needs, supply and demand in the debt markets, and other factors may also affect the liquidity balances and the funding balance between financial assets and financial liabilities. See the notes to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements for more information regarding contractual maturities of certain of the Bank's financial assets and liabilities.\nFinance Agency regulations establish criteria for four capital classifications, based on the amount and type of capital held by an FHLBank, as follows:\nCFTC No-action Relief for LIBOR Amendments. On December 17, 2019, three divisions of the CFTC issued no-action letters to provide relief with respect to the transition away from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates (IBORs). Among other forms of relief, the letters, subject to certain limitations, (i) permit registered swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap participants, and major security-based swap participants (covered swap entities) to amend an uncleared swap entered into before the compliance date of the CFTC's uncleared swap margin requirements (such swap, a legacy swap, and such requirements, the CFTC margin rules) to include LIBOR or other IBOR fallbacks without the legacy swap becoming subject to the CFTC margin rules; and (ii) provide time-limited relief, until December 31, 2021, for (a) swaps that are not subject to the central clearing requirement because they were executed prior to the relevant compliance date and (b) swaps that are subject to the trade execution requirement to be amended to include LIBOR or other IBOR fallbacks without becoming subject to such clearing or trade execution requirements.\nDeposits\n \u2022 the Bank's outstanding commitments arising from standby letters of credit.  Should an FHLBank be unable to satisfy its payment obligation under a consolidated obligation for which it is the primary obligor, any of the other FHLBanks, including the Bank, could be called upon to repay all or any part of such payment obligation, as determined or approved by the Finance Agency. As of December 31, 2019, none of the other FHLBanks defaulted on their consolidated obligations; the Finance Agency was not required to allocate any obligation among the FHLBanks; and no amount of the joint and several obligation was fixed. Accordingly, the Bank has not recognized a liability for its joint and several obligations related to other FHLBanks' consolidated obligations as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the FHLBanks had $1.0 trillion in aggregate par value of consolidated obligations issued and outstanding, $140.8 billion of which was attributable to the Bank. No FHLBank has ever defaulted on its principal or interest payments under any consolidated obligation, and the Bank has never been required to make payments under any consolidated obligation as a result of the failure of another FHLBank to meet its obligations.\nResults of Operations\nThe Bank seeks to manage the credit risk associated with the MPP and the MPF Program by maintaining underwriting and eligibility standards and structuring possible losses into several layers to be shared with the PFIs.\nThe legislative and regulatory environment in which the Bank and its members operate continues to evolve as a result of regulations enacted pursuant to the Housing Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bank's business operations, funding costs, rights, obligations, and/or the environment in which the Bank carries out its housing finance and community lending mission are likely to continue to be significantly impacted by these changes. Significant regulatory actions and developments for the period covered by this report are summarized below.\nThe FHLBank Act and Finance Agency regulations specify that each FHLBank must meet certain minimum regulatory capital standards. The Bank must maintain (1) total regulatory capital in an amount equal to at least four percent of its total assets; (2) leverage capital in an amount equal to at least five percent of its total assets; and (3) permanent capital in an amount equal to at least its regulatory risk-based capital requirement. Permanent capital is defined by the FHLBank Act and applicable regulations as the sum of paid-in capital for Class B stock and retained earnings. Mandatorily redeemable capital stock is considered capital for regulatory purposes. These regulatory capital requirements, and the Bank's compliance with these requirements, are presented in detail in Note 14-Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements.\nConsolidated Obligations\n (1) The down 200 basis points\u201d scenarios shown above are considered to be constrained shocks,\u201d intended to prevent the possibility of negative interest rates when a designated low rate environment exists. \nFor uncleared derivatives, the Bank is subject to nonperformance by counterparties. The Bank generally is required to post or collect collateral on uncleared derivative transactions. The amount of net unsecured credit exposure that is permissible with respect to each counterparty depends on the credit rating of that counterparty. A counterparty must deliver collateral to the Bank if the total market value of the Bank's exposure to that counterparty rises above a specific trigger point. As a result of these risk mitigation initiatives, the Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its uncleared derivatives as of December 31, 2019.\n (1) Investment amounts noted in the above table represent the carrying value and excludes related accrued interest receivable of $42 million as of December 31, 2018. \nThe increase in total investments was primarily due to the Bank positioning itself to meet new Finance Agency liquidity requirements. Additionally, the amount held in other investments will vary each day based on the Bank's liquidity needs as a result of advances demand, the earnings rates, and the availability of high quality counterparties in the federal funds market. The decrease in interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to a change in interpretation of regulatory guidance related to unsecured credit exposure.\nThe Bank enters into derivatives to reduce the interest-rate risk exposure inherent in otherwise unhedged assets and funding positions and attempts to do so in the most cost-efficient manner. The Bank does not engage in speculative trading of these instruments. The Bank's derivative positions may include interest-rate swaps, options, swaptions, interest-rate cap and floor agreements, and forward contracts. These derivatives are used to adjust the effective maturity, repricing frequency, or option characteristics of financial instruments to achieve risk-management objectives. Within its risk management strategy, the Bank uses derivative financial instruments in the following two ways:\nThe following table presents key components of net interest income for the years presented (in millions): \nContingent Liquidity. Finance Agency regulations require the Bank to maintain contingent liquidity in an amount sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for five business days if it is unable to access the capital markets. The Bank met these regulatory liquidity requirements throughout 2019.\nUnder the SEC Final Rule, which is now in effect, with certain exceptions, the receipt of loans from the beneficial owners of an audit client's equity securities where such beneficial owner has significant influence over the audit client would impair the independence of the auditor. The analysis under the Final Rule would be based on the facts and circumstances and would focus on whether the beneficial owners of an audit client's equity securities have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of an audit client.\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems, or from external events. Operational risk for the Bank also includes reputation and legal risks associated with business practices or market conduct that the Bank may undertake. Operational risk inherently is greatest where transaction processes include numerous processing steps, require greater subjectivity, or are non-routine. The Bank operates in a complex business environment and is subject to numerous regulatory requirements.\nNon-Private-label MBS\nDuring 2018, the Bank recorded in compensation and benefits an additional $13 million retirement plan accrual, which is the primary reason for the increase in total noninterest expense during 2018, compared to 2019.\nIn addition to Finance Agency regulations, the Bank has established guidelines approved by its board of directors regarding unsecured extensions of credit, with respect to term limits and eligible counterparties.\n\nfinancial assets, liabilities, and derivatives with maturities beyond December 31, 2021 for all product types except investments.\nConversely, lower rates of inflation or deflation have the opposite effects of the above on the Bank and its holdings.\nFinance Agency Proposed Amendments to Stress Test Rule. On December 16, 2019, the Finance Agency published a proposed rule amending its stress testing rule, consistent with section 401 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (EGRRCPA), (i) to raise the minimum threshold to conduct periodic stress tests for entities regulated by the Finance Agency from those with consolidated assets of more than $10 billion to those with consolidated assets of more than $250 billion, (ii) to remove the requirements for FHLBanks to conduct stress tests; and (iii) remove the adverse scenario from the list of required scenarios. The proposed rule maintains the Finance Agency's discretion to require that an FHLBank with total consolidated assets below the $250 billion threshold conduct stress testing. The proposed amendments align the Finance Agency's stress testing rules with rules adopted by other financial institution regulators that implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act stress testing requirements, as amended by the EGRRCPA. The results of the Bank's most recent annual severely adverse economic conditions stress test were published to our public website, www.fhlbatl.com, on November 15, 2019. If the rule is adopted as proposed, it will eliminate these stress testing requirements for FHLBanks, unless the Finance Agency exercises its discretion to require stress testing in the future. The Bank does not expect this rule, if adopted as proposed, to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations.\nFor purposes of determining each member's LCV, the Bank estimates the current market value of all residential first mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity loans, and lines of credit pledged as collateral based on information provided by the member on its loan portfolio or on individual loans through the regular collateral reporting process. The estimated market value is discounted to account for the (1) price volatility of loans, (2) model data uncertainty, and (3) estimated liquidation and servicing costs in the event of the member's default. Market values, and thus LCVs, change monthly. The use of this market-based valuation methodology allows the Bank to establish its collateral discounts with greater precision and to provide greater transparency with respect to the valuation of collateral pledged for advances and other credit products offered by the Bank.\n \u2022 discount rates; \nenhancements, which primarily consisted of the subordination of the claims of the other tranches of these securities. In addition to NRSRO ratings, the Bank considers a variety of credit quality factors when analyzing potential investments, such as collateral performance, marketability, asset class considerations, local and regional economic conditions, and the financial health of the underlying issuer.\n (1) For 2019, amounts reported include realized and unrealized gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships as part of net interest income. Prior period amounts do not conform to new hedge accounting guidance adopted January 1, 2019. \nNet interest income for the years presented was affected by changes in average balances (volume change) and changes in average rates (rate change) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The following table presents the extent to which volume changes and rate changes affected the Bank's interest income and interest expense (in millions). As presented in the table below, the overall change in net interest income during 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily volume related.\n____________\nFor those securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment was determined to have occurred during 2019, a summary of the significant inputs used to measure the amount of the credit loss recognized in earnings is contained in Note 8-Other-than-temporary Impairment to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements. In January 2020, the Bank sold its private-label MBS portfolio. See Note 22-Subsequent Events to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements for additional information.\nMembers that sold mortgage loans to the Bank were located primarily in the southeastern United States; therefore the Bank's conventional mortgage loan portfolio was concentrated in that region as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The following table presents the percentage of unpaid principal balance of conventional residential mortgage loans held for portfolio for the five largest state concentrations.\nThe following table presents the notional amounts of derivative financial instruments (in millions). The category Fair value hedges\u201d represents hedge strategies for which hedge accounting is achieved. The category Non-qualifying hedges\u201d represents hedge strategies for which the derivatives are not in designated hedging relationships that formally meet the hedge accounting requirements under GAAP. \nAll of the FHLBanks entered into a Capital Agreement, which is intended to enhance the capital position of each FHLBank. Under the Capital Agreement, each FHLBank allocates 20 percent of its net income each quarter to a separate restricted retained earnings account until the account balance equals at least one percent of the FHLBank's average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the previous quarter. Restricted retained earnings are not available to pay dividends and are presented separately on the Statements of Condition.\nThe Bank uses both sophisticated computer models and an experienced professional staff to measure the amount of interest-rate risk in the balance sheet, thus allowing management to monitor the risk against policy and regulatory limits. Management regularly reviews the major assumptions and methodologies used in the Bank's models and will make adjustments to the Bank's assumptions and methodologies in response to rapid changes in economic conditions.\n____________\nFinance Agency Supervisory Letter - Planning for LIBOR Phase-Out. On September 27, 2019, the Finance Agency issued a\nThe Bank identifies risk through daily operational monitoring, independent reviews, and the strategic planning and risk assessment programs that both consider the operational risk ramifications of the Bank's business strategies and environment. The Bank has established comprehensive financial and operating policies and procedures to mitigate the likelihood of loss resulting from the identified operational risks. In addition, the Bank's operational risk committee is responsible for overseeing the Bank's risk management policies, procedures, strategies, and activities related to operational risks, including overseeing the monitoring process and review of risk assessments. This oversight also includes compliance risk and reputational risk. The Bank effects related changes in processes, information systems, lines of communication, and other internal controls as deemed appropriate in response to identified or anticipated increases in operational risk.\n\n \u2022 Capital Adequacy - maintain adequate levels of capital components (retained earnings and capital stock) that protect against the risks inherent on the Bank's balance sheet and provide sufficient resiliency to withstand potential stressed losses. \n \u2022 the method for recording ineffectiveness for hedging relationships. \n \u2022 the overall economy; \n____________\nThe Bank determines credit risk rating or risk level ratings for its members by evaluating each institution's overall financial health, taking into account the quality of assets, earnings, and capital position. Prior to September 27, 2019, the Bank assigned each borrower that is an insured depository institution or an insurance company a credit risk rating from one to 10 according to the relative amount of credit risk that such borrower poses to the Bank (one being the least amount of credit risk and 10 the greatest amount of credit risk). The Bank assigned each borrower that is not an insured depository institution or insurance company (including housing associates, community development financial institutions, and corporate credit unions), a risk level rating based on a risk matrix developed for each entity type. Each risk level rating generally corresponds to the one to 10 credit risk rating for insured depository institutions, 101 being the least amount of credit risk and 104 the greatest amount of credit risk.\nCapital\n\nIf effective duration of equity or market value of equity is approaching the boundaries of the Bank's RMP ranges, management will initiate remedial action or review alternative strategies at the next meeting of the board of directors or appropriate committee thereof.\n\nInterest-rate risk represents the risk that the aggregate market value or estimated fair value of the Bank's asset, liability, and derivative portfolios will decline as a result of interest-rate volatility or that net earnings will be affected significantly by interest-rate changes. Interest-rate risk can occur in a variety of forms including repricing risk, yield-curve risk, basis risk, and option risk. The Bank faces repricing risk whenever an asset and a liability reprice at different times and with different rates, resulting in interest-margin sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Yield-curve risk reflects the possibility that changes in the shape of the yield curve may affect the market value of the Bank's assets and liabilities differently because a liability used to fund an asset may be short-term, while the asset is long-term, or vice versa. Basis risk occurs when yields on assets and costs on liabilities are based on different bases, such as LIBOR, versus the Bank's cost of funds. Different bases can move at different rates or in different directions, which can cause erratic changes in revenues and expenses. Option risk is presented by the optionality that is embedded in some assets and liabilities. Mortgage assets represent the primary source of option risk.\n(1) For 2019, amounts reported exclude realized and unrealized gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships. Prior period amounts do not conform to new hedge accounting guidance adopted January 1, 2019.\n(1) Collateral held with respect to derivatives with member institutions when the Bank is acting as an intermediary represents the amount of eligible collateral physically held by or on behalf of the Bank or collateral assigned to the Bank, as evidenced by a written security agreement, and held by the member institution for the benefit of the Bank.\nA positive effective duration of equity or a positive effective duration gap results when the effective duration of assets is greater than the effective duration of liabilities. A negative effective duration of equity or a negative effective duration gap results when the effective duration of assets is less than the effective duration of liabilities. A positive effective duration of equity or a positive effective duration gap generally indicates that the Bank has some exposure to interest-rate risk in a rising rate environment, and a negative effective duration of equity or a negative effective duration gap generally indicates some exposure to interest-rate risk in a declining interest-rate environment. Higher effective duration numbers, whether positive or negative, indicate greater volatility of market value of equity in response to changing interest rates.\n \u2022 identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged item; \nAn assessment must be made to determine the effectiveness of qualifying hedging relationships. To make such an assessment, the Bank either uses (1) the short-cut method; or (2) the long-haul method.\nExecutive Summary\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell are considered collateralized financing arrangements and effectively represent short-term loans transacted with counterparties that the Bank considers to be of investment quality. The terms of these loans are structured such that if the fair value of the underlying securities decreases below the fair value required as collateral, the counterparty must place an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an equivalent amount of cash. If an agreement to resell is deemed to be impaired, the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the agreement is recognized in earnings. Based upon the collateral held as security, the Bank determined that no allowance for credit losses was needed for the securities purchased under agreements to resell as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe Bank's interest-rate spread was 25 basis points, 28 basis points, and seven basis points for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The decrease in interest-rate spread during 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily due to changes in interest rates that impacted interest expense related to interest-bearing liabilities more than the offsetting interest income related to interest-earning assets. Decreased advances balances in 2019, compared to 2018, also contributed to the decrease. The increase in interest-rate spread during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to the increased prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances during 2017 as previously discussed, which decreased net interest income during 2017.\nRisk Management\nDerivatives\n (2) Represents interest income or expense on derivatives included in net interest income. \n (1) For 2019, interest amounts reported for advances and consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes include realized and unrealized gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships. Prior period interest amounts do not conform to new hedge accounting guidance adopted January 1, 2019. \nThe following tables present information on the credit ratings of the Bank's investments held as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in millions), based on their credit ratings as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The credit ratings reflect the lowest long-term credit ratings as reported by an NRSRO.\n\n\nThe Bank faces credit risk primarily with respect to its advances, investments, derivatives, and mortgage loan assets.\nThe following table presents the Bank's effective duration exposure measurements as calculated in accordance with Bank policy (in years).\n \u2022 Market Risk/Earnings - maintain an adequate ROE spread to average three-month LIBOR, while providing attractive funding for advance products, consistent payment of dividends, reliable access to funding, and maintenance of retained earnings in excess of stressed retained earnings targets within a conservative risk management framework. \nThe following table presents a summary of the significant inputs used to evaluate each of the Bank's private-label MBS for other-than-temporary impairment as of December 31, 2019.\nIn its history, the Bank has never experienced a credit loss on an advance. In consideration of this and the Bank's policies and practices detailed above, the Bank has not established an allowance for credit losses on advances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe Bank records all derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in current-period earnings. The Bank designates derivatives as either fair-value hedging instruments or non-qualifying hedging instruments for which hedge accounting is not applied. The Bank has not entered into any cash-flow hedges as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Bank uses derivatives in its risk management program for the following purposes:\n \u2022 macro hedging of balance sheet risks. \n (1) Federal funds sold includes $175 million with BankUnited, National Association, and $425 million with Sun Trust Bank, both of which were one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2018. \n________________\nIn 2019, regulators published certain rules or issued guidance applicable to swaps:\n\n \u2022 Adequately Capitalized - FHLBank meets or exceeds both risk-based and minimum capital requirements; \nThe RMP also governs the Bank's approach to managing the above risks. The Bank's board of directors reviews the RMP annually and approves amendments to the RMP from time to time as necessary. To promote compliance with the RMP, the Bank has established internal management committees to provide oversight of these risks. The Bank produces a comprehensive risk assessment report on an annual basis that is reviewed by the board of directors. In addition to the established risk appetite and the RMP, the Bank is also subject to Finance Agency regulations and policies regarding risk management.\n \u2022 market volatility; and \nThe Bank measures its potential market risk exposure in a number of ways. These include asset, liability, and equity duration analyses; and earnings forecast scenario analyses that reflect repricing gaps. The Bank establishes tolerance limits for these financial metrics and uses internal models to measure each of these risk exposures at least monthly.\nThe contractual or notional amount of derivative transactions reflects the involvement of the Bank in the various classes of financial instruments; however, the Bank's maximum credit risk with respect to derivative transactions is the estimated cost of replacing the derivative transactions if there is default, less the value of any related collateral, including initial and variation margin. In determining the maximum credit risk, the Bank considers accrued interest receivables and payables, as well as the netting requirements to net assets and liabilities.\nAdvances\nWith respect to investments, the FHLBanks were required, by December 31, 2019, to stop purchasing investments that reference LIBOR and mature after December 31, 2021. These phase-out dates do not apply to collateral accepted by the FHLBanks. The Supervisory Letter also directs the FHLBanks to update their pledged collateral certification reporting requirements by March 31, 2020 in an effort to encourage members to distinguish LIBOR-linked collateral maturing after December 31, 2021.\nUncertainty Regarding Brexit. In June 2016, the United Kingdom (the UK) voted in favor of leaving the European Union (the EU), and in March 2017, Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty was invoked, commencing a period of negotiations between the UK and the European Council for the UK's withdrawal from the EU, which was subsequently extended by the European Council members in agreement with the UK. On January 31, 2020, the UK withdrew from the EU under the European Union Withdrawal Act 2020, with a transition period to last until December 31, 2020, which period may be extended for an additional two years. During this transition period, the UK and the EU will negotiate the details of their future relationship, including what conditions will apply to EU-based entities that want to do business with the UK, and vice versa, after the transition period.\nAssessment of Hedge Effectiveness\n \u2022 Liquidity Risk - maintain sufficient liquidity and funding sources to allow the Bank to meet expected and unexpected obligations. \nMarket Risk\n(1) Economic Development and Growth Enhancement Program\nThe Bank measures interest-rate risk exposure by various methods. The primary methods used are (1) calculating the effective duration of assets, liabilities, and equity under various scenarios; and (2) calculating the theoretical market value of equity. Effective duration, normally expressed in years or months, measures the price sensitivity of the Bank's interest-bearing assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. As effective duration lengthens, market-value changes become more sensitive to interest-rate changes. The Bank employs sophisticated modeling systems to measure effective duration.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that after 2021 it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR. In response, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee to identify a set of alternative reference interest rates for possible use as market benchmarks. This committee has proposed SOFR as its recommended alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in the second quarter of 2018. SOFR is based on a broad segment of the overnight Treasury repurchase market and is intended to be a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities.\n____________\nIf the counterparty has an NRSRO rating, the net exposure after collateral is treated as unsecured credit, consistent with the Bank's RMP and Finance Agency regulations. If the counterparty does not have an NRSRO rating, the Bank requires collateral for the full amount of the exposure.\n (1) For 2019, amounts reported include realized and unrealized gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships as part of net interest income. \n(3) Amounts do not reflect collateral; see the table under Risk Management-Credit Risk-Derivatives below for a breakdown of the credit ratings of and the Bank's credit exposure to derivative counterparties, including net exposure after collateral.\nThe Bank's primary off-balance sheet commitments are as follows:\nMortgage loans purchased under the MPP and MPF Program must comply with the underwriting and eligibility standards set forth in applicable MPP guidelines or MPF guidelines. In both MPP and MPF, the Bank and PFIs share the risk of losses on mortgage loans by structuring potential losses on conventional mortgage loans into layers with respect to each master commitment and in compliance with the applicable regulations governing the purchase of mortgage loans by the Bank.\n \u2022 Reputation - recognize the importance of and advance positive awareness and perception of the Bank and its mission among key external stakeholders impacting the Bank's ability to achieve its mission. \nThe Bank records AHP assessment expense at a rate of 10 percent of income before assessment, excluding interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock.\nUnder the prior loan rule on debtor-creditor relationships, the independence of an accounting firm generally could be called into question if it or a covered person in the accounting firm received a loan from a lender that is a record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the audit client's equity securities.\u201d A covered person in the firm includes personnel on the audit engagement team, personnel in the chain of command, partners and managers who provide ten or more hours of non-audit services to the audit client, and partners in the office where the lead engagement partner practices in connection with the client. The SEC Final Rule replaced the existing ten percent bright-line test with a significant influence test similar to that referenced in other SEC rules and based on concepts applied in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 323.\n\nConsolidated obligations outstanding were primarily variable rate as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Bank often simultaneously entered into derivatives with the issuance of consolidated obligation bonds to convert the interest rates, in effect, into short-term variable interest rates, which were usually based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, 83.3 percent and 80.7 percent, respectively, of the Bank's fixed-rate consolidated obligation bonds were swapped. None of the Bank's variable-rate consolidated obligation bonds were swapped as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2019, 33.9 percent of the Bank's fixed-rate consolidated obligation discount notes were swapped and none of the Bank's fixed-rate consolidated obligation discount notes were swapped as of December 31, 2018. By March 31, 2020, the Bank will cease entering into LIBOR-based derivatives with termination dates beyond December 31, 2021.\n (3) Includes trading securities at fair value and available-for-sale securities at amortized cost. \nCertain of the Bank's uncleared derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Bank to post additional collateral with its counterparties if there is a deterioration in the Bank's credit rating. If the Bank's credit rating had been lowered from its current rating to the next lower rating, the Bank would have been required to deliver $2 million of collateral at fair value to its uncleared derivative counterparties as of December 31, 2019.\n____________\nFor discussion of the Bank's competition for advances, see Item 1, Business-Competition above. For discussion of recent regulatory activity that may have a material impact on the Bank's operations, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Legislative and Regulatory Developments. The Bank attempts to mitigate these risks through long-term strategic planning and through continually monitoring economic indicators and the external environment.\n (1) For 2019, amounts reported include realized and unrealized gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships as part of net interest income. Prior period amounts do not conform to new hedge accounting guidance adopted January 1, 2019. \n____________\n \u2022 Governance/Compliance/Legal - compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and manage other legal exposures. \nRefer to the respective footnotes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on each of the contractual obligations and commitments listed in the above table.\nNoninterest Income (Loss)\n (2) Represents the amortization or accretion of hedging fair value adjustments for both open and closed hedge positions. \n \u2022 conversion of a variable rate with a fixed component to another variable rate; and \n\nThe following table presents the Bank's advances outstanding by year of maturity and the related weighted-average interest rate (dollars in millions):\n \u2022 fixed-rate or variable-rate MBS, CMOs, and REMICs that are at rates equal to their contractual cap on the trade date and that have average lives that vary by more than six years under an assumed instantaneous interest-rate change of 300 basis points; and \nThe unrealized losses related to government-sponsored enterprise MBS are caused by interest-rate changes. Because these securities are guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, it is expected that these securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost basis. The Bank does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2019 because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality; the Bank does not intend to sell the investments; and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.\nMerger activity involving the Bank's members can impact the Bank's business outlook. As the financial industry continues to experience consolidation, our membership base may decrease, and our advance balance and other business could increase or decrease significantly depending upon the size of the financial institutions involved in the merger. While the Bank's balance sheet is designed to expand and contract based upon advance demand, the Bank's business could be affected by this merger activity, including as a result of a single event, such as the loss of a member's business due to acquisition by a non-member.\nThe Bank expects the SEC Final Rule to resolve the matters we discussed in Item 9B - Other Information in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Bank obtains collateral on advances to protect against losses, but Finance Agency regulations permit the Bank to accept only certain types of collateral. Each borrower must maintain an amount of qualifying collateral that, when discounted to the lendable collateral value (LCV), is equal to at least 100 percent of the borrower's outstanding par value of all advances and other liabilities from the Bank. The LCV is the value that the Bank assigns to each type of qualifying collateral for purposes of determining the amount of credit that such qualifying collateral will support. For each type of qualifying collateral, the Bank discounts the market value of the qualifying collateral to calculate the LCV. The Bank regularly reevaluates the appropriate level of discounting. The Bank had rights to collateral on a borrower-by-borrower basis with an estimated value equal to or greater than its outstanding extension of credit as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The following table presents information about the types of collateral held for the Bank's advances (dollars in millions).\nUnder the Bank's financial management policy, the Bank targets to maintain (1) a capital-to-assets ratio of 4.50 percent to 5.00 percent; (2) a retained earnings account balance equal to the restricted retained earnings account balance, plus extremely stressed scenario losses; and (3) unrestricted retained earnings greater than the retained earnings target. The Bank believes that daily excess stock repurchases and consistent dividends give members greater certainty of a return of their principal or the receipt of a dividend, which in turn may have a positive impact on members' appetite for advances. The Bank seeks to pay an amount of dividends each quarter that are consistent with an attractive rate of return on capital to its member shareholders\nCredit Risk\nThe Bank also evaluates each debt issuance, advance made, and financial instrument purchased to determine whether the cash item contains embedded derivatives that meet the criteria for bifurcation. If, after evaluation, it is determined that an embedded derivative must be bifurcated, the Bank will measure the fair value of the embedded derivative.\nValuation models and their underlying assumptions are based on the best estimates of the Bank's management with respect to:\nsubject to the prudential margin rules in the event that they are amended due to certain life-cycle activities, such as reductions of notional amounts or portfolio compression exercises.\nOn October 24, 2019, the CFTC proposed an amendment to its CFTC margin rules, which among other changes, would similarly extend the phase-in compliance date for initial margin requirements from September 1, 2020 to September 1, 2021 for counterparties with an AANA of non-cleared swaps from $8 billion to $50 billion. The Bank does not expect this rule, if adopted as proposed, to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. The Bank also believes the provisions of the rule related to LIBOR replacement, if adopted as proposed, may assist in the market's and the Bank's transition away from LIBOR.\nThe primary goal of the Bank's interest-rate risk measurement and management efforts is to control the above risks through prudent asset-liability management strategies so that the Bank may provide members with dividends that are consistently competitive with existing market interest rates on alternative short-term and variable-rate investments. The Bank attempts to manage interest-rate risk exposure by using appropriate funding instruments and hedging strategies. Hedging may occur at the micro level, for one or more specifically identified transactions, or at the macro level. Management evaluates the Bank's macro hedge position and funding strategies on a daily basis and makes adjustments as necessary.\n \u2022 the yield on variable-rate assets held by the Bank increases; \nThe Bank accounts for any ineffectiveness for all long-haul fair-value hedges using the dollar offset method. In the case of non-qualifying hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Bank reports only the change in the fair value of the derivative. Both the net interest on the derivative and the fair value adjustments of a non-qualifying hedge are recorded in noninterest income (loss) as Net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d on the Statements of Income. Beginning January 1, 2019, the Bank adopted new hedge accounting guidance, which, among other things, impacts the presentation of gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities for qualifying hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that are effective as, and that are designated and qualify as, a fair-value hedge, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk (including changes that reflect losses or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in net interest income in the same line as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Prior to January 1, 2019, any hedge ineffectiveness (which represented the amount by which the change in the fair value of the derivative differed from the change in the fair value of the hedged item) was recorded in noninterest income (loss) as Net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d on the Statements of Income.\nFinance Agency regulations prohibit the Bank from investing in any of the following securities:\nAccounting for Ineffectiveness and Hedge De-designation\nThe Bank only enters into investments with U.S. counterparties or U.S. branch offices of foreign banks that have been approved by the Bank through its internal approval process, but the Bank may still have exposure to foreign entities if a counterparty's parent entity is located in another country. The following tables present the Bank's gross exposure, by instrument type, according to the location of the parent company of the counterparty (in millions).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 debt instruments that are not of investment quality, other than certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities and instruments that the Bank determined became less than investment quality because of developments or events that occurred after purchase by the Bank; \nIn general, borrowers with the greatest amount of credit risk may have more restrictions on the types of collateral they may use to secure advances, may be required to maintain higher collateral maintenance levels and deliver loan collateral, may be restricted from obtaining further advances, and may face more stringent collateral reporting requirements. At times, based upon the Bank's assessment of a borrower and its collateral, the Bank may place more restrictive requirements on a borrower than those generally applicable to borrowers with the same rating. Management and the board also monitor the Bank's concentration in secured credit and standby letters of credit exposure to individual borrowers.\nThe Bank does not expect the Business Resiliency AB to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations.\nSecurities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell\n\nRefer to Note 19-Commitments and Contingencies to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements for more information about the Bank's outstanding standby letters of credit.\nManagement continues to be focused and engaged on implementing an effective transition away from LIBOR. Many of the Bank's assets and liabilities are indexed to LIBOR, and many of the Bank's derivative transactions are also indexed to LIBOR. In 2019, the Bank began engaging in Overnight Index Swap (OIS) and SOFR-based derivative transactions. There are complexities, risks and uncertainties involved with transitioning to alternative rates, and the transition involves considerable time and resources, all of which can impact the Bank's business outlook.\nThe long-haul method of effectiveness is used to assess effectiveness for hedging relationships that qualify for hedge accounting but do not meet the criteria for the use of the short-cut method. The long-haul method requires separate valuations of both the hedged item and the hedging instrument. If the hedging relationship is determined to be highly effective, the change in fair value of the hedged item related to the designated risk is recognized in current period earnings in the same period as the change in fair value of the hedging instrument. If the hedging relationship is determined not to be highly effective, hedge accounting will either not be allowed or cease at that point. The Bank performs effectiveness testing on a monthly basis and uses statistical regression analysis techniques to determine whether a long-haul hedging relationship is highly effective.\n \u2022 Significantly Undercapitalized - FHLBank has less than 75 percent of one or both of its risk-based or minimum capital requirements; and \nCommitments to extend credit, including standby letters of credit, are agreements to lend. The Bank issues a standby letter of credit on behalf of a member in exchange for a fee. A member may use these standby letters of credit to facilitate a financing arrangement. Management regularly reviews its standby letter of credit pricing in light of several factors, including the Bank's potential liquidity needs related to draws on its standby letters of credit. Based on management's credit analyses and collateral requirements, the Bank does not deem it necessary to have an allowance for credit losses for these unfunded standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2019.\n \u2022 the Bank's joint and several liability for all FHLBank consolidated obligations; and \nThe following table presents the Bank's market value of equity measurements as calculated in accordance with Bank policy (in millions). \nThese assumptions, particularly estimates of market indices and discount rates, may have a significant effect on the reported fair values of assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and the income and expense related thereto. The use of different assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could result in a materially different net income and retained earnings. The assumptions used in the models are corroborated by and independently verified against market observable data where possible.\nThe Bank recorded net income of $367 million for 2019, a decrease of $49 million, or 11.9 percent, from net income of $416 million for 2018. Net interest income attributed $26 million of this decrease. Net interest income was $535 million for 2019, compared to $561 million for 2018.\n\nThe Finance Agency regulations prohibit an FHLBank from purchasing MBS and asset-backed securities if its investment in such securities would exceed 300 percent of the FHLBank's previous month-end regulatory capital on the day it would\n (1) The down 200 basis points\u201d scenarios shown above are considered to be constrained shocks,\u201d intended to prevent the possibility of negative interest rates when a designated low rate environment exists. \nMortgage Loans Held for Portfolio\nFair Value Measurements\nIf the hedging instrument is a swap and meets specific criteria, the hedging relationship may qualify for the short-cut method of assessing effectiveness. The short-cut method allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness, which means that the change in the fair value of the hedged item is assumed to be equal and offsetting to the change in fair value of the hedging instrument. For periods beginning after May 31, 2005, the Bank determined that it would no longer apply the short-cut method to new hedging relationships.\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the Bank's audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2019 included in Item 8 of this Report. Readers also should carefully review Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a description of the forward-looking statements in this Report and a discussion of the factors that might cause the Bank's actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from these forward-looking statements.\nContractual Obligations\n \u2022 Operational Risk - (1) manage the key risks associated with operational availability of critical systems and services, the integrity and security of the Bank's information, and the alignment of technology investment with key business objectives through enterprise-wide risk management practices and governance based on industry standards; (2) deliver an employee value proposition that allows the Bank to build, retain, engage, and develop staff to meet the evolving needs of the Bank's key stakeholders and effectively manage enterprise-wide risks; and (3) manage the key risks associated with cyber security threats. \n \u2022 Mission/Business Model - (1) deliver financial services and consistent access to affordable funds that are the size and structure shareholders desire, helping them to manage risk and extend credit in their communities, while achieving the Bank's affordable housing mission goals; and (2) provide value through the consistent payment of dividends and the repurchasing of excess stock. \nFrom time to time the Bank may have exposure to UK-based and EU-based counterparties. At this time it is not possible to predict the date on which the transition period will end or whether any agreement reached between the UK and the EU will have a material adverse effect on the financial instruments governing the contractual terms with these counterparties.\nSupervisory Letter (Supervisory Letter) to the FHLBanks that the Finance Agency stated is designed to ensure the FHLBanks\n____________\nThe prepayment risk in both advances and investment assets can significantly affect the Bank's effective duration of equity and effective duration gap. Current regulations require the Bank to mitigate advance prepayment risk by establishing prepayment fees that make the Bank financially indifferent to a borrower's decision to prepay an advance that carries a rate above current market rates unless the advance contains explicit par value prepayment options. The Bank's prepayment fees for advances without embedded options are generally based on the present value of the difference between the rate on the prepaid advance and the current rate on an advance with an identical maturity date. Prepayment fees for advances that contain embedded options are generally based on the inverse of the market value of the derivative instrument that the Bank used to hedge the advance.\n \u2022 As an asset-liability management tool, for which hedge accounting is not applied (non-qualifying hedge). The Bank may enter into derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the Bank recognizes the change in fair value and interest income or expense of these derivatives in the Noninterest income (loss)\u201d section of the Statements of Income as Net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities\u201d with no offsetting fair-value adjustments of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitment. Consequently, these transactions can introduce earnings volatility. \nral derivative counterparties. The parent companies of the clearing agents are monitored through annual reviews, as well as through the Bank's daily monitoring tools, which include reviewing equity triggers, debt triggers, and credit default swap spread triggers. In addition, exposures to the clearing agents are monitored daily on a swap counterparty report. The Bank currently has the following three approved clearing agents: Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, and Goldman Sachs & Co. The Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its cleared derivatives as of December 31, 2019.\n\nThe unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans was $297 million and $361 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans was $1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe following discussion and analysis relates to the Bank's financial condition as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. This section explains the changes in certain key items in the Bank's financial statements from year to year, the primary factors driving those changes, the Bank's risk management processes and results, known trends or uncertainties that the Bank believes may have a material effect on the Bank's future performance, as well as how certain accounting principles affect the Bank's financial statements. For a discussion on the comparison between the results of operations for the years ended 2018 and 2017, see the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which are contained in the Bank's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 7, 2019.\n \u2022 the financial services industry or the Bank's competitive environment; and \nThe increase in net interest income during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to increased prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances during 2017. These prepayments resulted in $307 million of accelerated amortization during 2017. This accelerated amortization reduced net interest income and was offset by a corresponding increase in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities, reflected in noninterest income. The 2017 prepayments of previously restructured and redesignated advances primarily relate to a single member institution. The remaining change in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in interest rates, which impacted interest-earning assets more than the offsetting increase in consolidated obligation expense.\nThe Bank's RMP permits the Bank to invest in U.S. agency (i.e., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) obligations including the following: (1) CMOs and REMICS that are backed by such securities; and (2) other MBS, CMOs, and REMICS that are of sufficient investment quality, which typically have the highest credit ratings issued by S&P or Moody's at the time of purchase. The private-label MBS purchased by the Bank originally attained their triple-A ratings through credit\nOne way in which the Bank analyzes its performance is by comparing its annualized return on equity (ROE) to three-month average LIBOR. The Bank has chosen to measure ROE as a spread to average three-month LIBOR because the Bank has significant assets and liabilities priced to average three-month LIBOR. The Bank's ROE was 5.09 percent for 2019, compared to 5.54 percent for 2018. This decrease in ROE was primarily due to the decrease in net income during the year. ROE spread to average three-month LIBOR was 276 basis points for 2019, compared to 323 basis points for 2018. This decrease in the ROE spread to three-month average LIBOR was primarily due to the decrease in ROE.\nThe Bank's lending, investment and funding activities, and use of derivative hedge instruments expose the Bank to a number of risks. A robust risk management framework aligns risk-taking activities with the Bank's strategies and risk appetite. A risk management framework also balances risks and rewards. The Bank's risk management framework consists of risk governance, risk appetite, and risk management policies.\nResults of Operations\n \u2022 market indices (primarily LIBOR and the OIS curve); \n\nThe following table presents more detailed information regarding investments held by the Bank (dollars in millions).\nThe Bank generally requires standby letters of credit to contain language permitting the Bank, upon annual renewal dates and prior notice to the beneficiary, to choose not to renew the standby letter of credit, which effectively terminates the standby letter of credit prior to its scheduled final expiration date. Based on the creditworthiness of the member applicant and appropriate additional fees, the Bank may issue standby letters of credit that have terms of longer than one year without annual renewals or that have no stated maturity and are subject to renewal on an annual basis.\n \u2022 whole mortgages or other whole loans, other than the following: (1) those acquired under the Bank's mortgage purchase programs; (2) certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities; (3) certain marketable direct obligations of state, local, or tribal government units or agencies that are of investment quality; (4) MBS or asset-backed securities that are backed by manufactured housing loans or home equity loans; and (5) certain foreign housing loans that are authorized under section 12(b) of the FHLBank Act; \nIf this rule is adopted as proposed, the Bank does not expect it to materially affect its financial condition or results of operations. However, if adopted as proposed, the rule could affect the demand for certain of the Bank's advance products, but the extent of the impact is uncertain.\n \u2022 interest-only or principal-only stripped MBS, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), collateralized debt obligations, and real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs); \nThe following table presents the Bank's significant income items for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, and provides information regarding the changes during those years (dollars in millions). These items are discussed in more detail below.\n \u2022 legislation, regulation, or congressional scrutiny affecting the Bank or its members. \n (1) Includes all fixed-rate advances that have cap/floor optionality and excludes convertible advances. \nInvestments\nThe Bank is exposed to market risk because changes in interest rates and spreads can have a direct effect on the value of the Bank's assets and liabilities. As a result of the volume of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest-rate risk component of market risk has the greatest impact on the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislative and Regulatory Developments\n____________\nAs of December 31, 2019, total assets were $149.9 billion, a decrease of $4.6 billion, or 2.99 percent, from December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to an $11.3 billion, or 10.4 percent, decrease in advances which was due to maturities that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2019 and a decrease in members' liquidity needs. The decrease was partially offset by a $6.3 billion, or 14.2 percent, increase in total investments.\n \u2022 non-U.S. dollar denominated securities. \nThe majority of the Bank's assets and liabilities are, and will continue to be, monetary in nature. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or to the same extent, as the prices of goods and services, higher rates of inflation generally result in corresponding increases in interest rates. Inflation, coupled with increasing interest rates, generally has the following effects on the Bank:\nFair values play an important role in the valuation of certain assets, liabilities, and hedging transactions of the Bank. Fair values are based on quoted market prices or market-based prices, if such prices are available, even in situations in which trading volume may be low when compared with prior periods. If quoted market prices or market-based prices are not available, the Bank determines fair values based on valuation models that use discounted cash flows, using market estimates of interest rates and volatility.\nInterest-rate Risk Exposure Measurement\n____________\n____________\n \u2022 the cost of the Bank's funds and operating overhead increases; \nRefer to Note 18-Estimated Fair Values to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements for further discussion regarding how the Bank measures financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value.\n \u2022 other factors, including default and loss rates. \nFinancial Condition\nPortions of the Liquidity Guidance AB were implemented on December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, with full implementation to take place on December 31, 2019. The Bank has increased the amount of liquid assets it holds to meet the December 31, 2019 implementation date of this guidance.\nThe Bank continues to evaluate the potential impact of the Supervisory Letter on its financial condition and results of operations, but the Bank has begun to change its investment strategy, may experience lower overall demand or increased costs for its advances, and it may be necessary to change the Bank's hedging strategy, all of which in turn may negatively impact the future composition of the Bank's balance sheet, capital stock levels, core mission asset ratio, net income and dividend.\n____________\n____________\nThe Supervisory Letter provides that the FHLBanks should, by March 31, 2020, cease entering into new LIBOR referenced\nThe Bank's business and the demand for advances from the Bank are generally not subject to the effects of cyclical or seasonal variations, although the Bank's advance demand may vary based upon fluctuations of its members' consumer credit liquidity needs.\nFinancial Condition\n____________\nrelative to an established benchmark, LIBOR, after providing for retained earnings as discussed above. Historically, the Bank's dividend rate has increased with increases in LIBOR, while the spread between the dividend rate and LIBOR may shrink. Conversely, the dividend rate may decrease during periods of lower LIBOR, while the spread may increase. The Bank's ability to maintain dividends consistent with its recent trend depends on LIBOR remaining relatively stable, the Bank's actual financial performance, its ability to maintain adequate retained earnings, other factors described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and the discretion of the Bank's board of directors. Information about dividends paid by the Bank during 2019, 2018, and 2017, is contained in Note 14-Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements.\nUnder the Bank's RMP, the Bank's market value of equity must not decline by more than 15 percent, assuming an immediate, parallel, and sustained interest-rate shock of 200 basis points in either direction.\nlimiting the types of MBS the Bank may own to those with defined estimated average life changes under specific interest-rate shock scenarios. These limits do not apply to mortgage loans purchased from members. The Bank typically hedges mortgage prepayment uncertainty by using callable debt as a funding source and by using interest-rate cap, floor, and swaption transactions. The Bank also uses derivatives to reduce effective duration and option risks for investment securities other than MBS. Effective duration and option risk exposures are measured on a regular basis for all investment assets under alternative rate scenarios.\n___________\nThe Bank maintained continual access to funding and adapted its debt issuance to meet the needs of its members throughout 2019. The Bank's short-term funding was generally driven by member demand and was achieved through the issuance of consolidated discount notes and short-term consolidated bonds throughout 2019. Access to short-term debt markets has been reliable because investors, driven by increased liquidity preferences and risk aversion, including the effects of money market fund reform, have sought the Bank's short-term debt as an asset of choice, which has led to advantageous funding opportunities and increased utilization of debt maturing in one year or less.\nThe following tables present information on the credit ratings of, and the Bank's credit exposure to, its derivative counterparties (in millions). The credit ratings reflect the lowest long-term credit rating by an NRSRO.\nThe Bank establishes a credit limit for each borrower. The credit limit is not a committed line of credit, but rather an indication of the borrower's general borrowing capacity with the Bank. The Bank determines the credit limit in its sole and absolute discretion by evaluating a wide variety of factors that indicate the borrower's overall creditworthiness. The credit limit is generally expressed as a percentage equal to the ratio of the borrower's total liabilities to the Bank (including the face amount of outstanding standby letters of credit, the par value of outstanding advances, and the total exposure of the Bank to the borrower under any derivative contract) to the borrower's total assets. Generally, borrowers are held to a credit limit of no more\nNoninterest Expense and AHP Assessment\n \u2022 instruments issued by non-United States entities, other than those issued by United States branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks; \nFinance Agency regulations do not permit the Bank to rely exclusively on Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) ratings with respect to its investments. The Bank is required to make a determination of whether a security is of investment quality based on its own documented analysis, which includes the NRSRO rating as one of the factors that is assessed to determine investment quality. The Bank monitors the financial condition of investment counterparties to ensure that they are in compliance with the Bank's RMP and Finance Agency regulations. Unsecured credit exposure to any counterparty is limited by the credit quality and capital of the counterparty and by the capital of the Bank. On a regular basis, management produces financial monitoring reports detailing the financial condition of the Bank's counterparties. These reports are reviewed by the Bank's board of directors. In addition to the Bank's RMP and regulatory requirements, the Bank may limit or suspend overnight and term trading. Limiting or suspending counterparties limits the pool of available counterparties, shifts the geographical distribution of counterparty exposure, and may reduce the Bank's overall investment opportunities.\n\nThe Bank funds its assets primarily through the issuance of consolidated obligation bonds and consolidated obligation discount notes. The decrease in consolidated obligations from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 was primarily a result of the decrease in advances outstanding during the year. Consolidated obligation issuances financed 93.9 percent of the $149.9 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2019, remaining relatively stable compared to the financing ratio of 94.0 percent as of December 31, 2018.\n\nSecured advances to member financial institutions account for the largest category of Bank assets; thus, advances are a major source of the Bank's credit risk exposure. The Bank uses a risk-focused approach to credit and collateral underwriting. The Bank attempts to reduce credit risk on advances by monitoring the financial condition of borrowers and the quality and value of the assets that borrowers pledge as eligible collateral.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u2022 residual-interest or interest-accrual classes of CMOs and REMICs; \n (4) Includes only those gains or losses on trading securities or financial instruments held at fair value that have an economic derivative assigned;\u201d therefore, this line item may not agree to the income statement. \nLiquidity Reserves for Deposits. Finance Agency regulations require the Bank to hold a total amount of cash, obligations of the U.S., and advances with maturities of less than five years, in an amount not less than the amount of total member deposits. The Bank has complied with this requirement throughout 2019.\n____________\nRefer to Note 6-Available-for-sale Securities and Note 7-Held-to-maturity Securities to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements for information on securities with unrealized losses as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n \u2022 Undercapitalized - FHLBank does not meet one or both of its risk-based or minimum capital requirements; \nThe Bank's business model continues to be focused on enhancing the total value of the cooperative for its members by serving as their trusted advisor. The Bank focuses these efforts on offering readily available, competitively priced advances, a potential return on investment, support for community investment activities, and other credit and noncredit products and services. As part of the Bank's cooperative structure, the Bank has chosen to operate with narrow margins, passing on its low funding costs to members, which causes the Bank's profitability to be sensitive to changes in market conditions.\n (5) Amount in Other\u201d includes the price alignment amount on derivatives for which variation margin is characterized as daily settled contract. \n____________\n (3) Includes only those gains or losses on trading securities or financial instruments held at fair value that have an economic derivative assigned;\u201d therefore, this line item may not agree to the income statement. \nAdditional Liquidity Guidance. On August 23, 2018, the Finance Agency issued a final Advisory Bulletin on FHLBank liquidity (Liquidity Guidance AB) that communicates the Finance Agency's expectations with respect to the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to enable the Bank to provide advances and standby letters of credit for members during a sustained capital market disruption, assuming no access to capital markets and assuming renewal of all maturing advances for a period of between ten to thirty calendar days. Contemporaneously with the issuance of the Liquidity Guidance AB, the Finance Agency issued a supervisory letter that identifies initial thresholds for measures of liquidity within the established ranges set forth in the Liquidity Guidance AB.\nAs discussed above, net interest income includes components of hedging activity. When hedging relationships qualify for hedge accounting, the interest components of the hedging derivatives will be reflected in interest income or expense. Beginning on January 1, 2019, the fair value gains and losses of derivatives and hedged items designated in fair value hedge relationships are also recognized in interest income or interest expense. Prior to January 1, 2019, the portion of fair value gains and losses of derivatives and hedged items representing hedge ineffectiveness were recorded in noninterest income. When a hedging relationship is discontinued, the cumulative fair value adjustment on the hedged item will be amortized into interest income or expense over the remaining life of the asset or liability. The impact of hedging on net interest income was a decrease of $31 million and $91 million, during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n (2) Federal funds sold includes $100 million with BankUnited, National Association, one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2019, and includes $175 million with BankUnited, National Association, and $425 million with SunTrust Bank, both of which were one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2018. \nThe following table presents the payment due dates or expiration terms of the Bank's long-term contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019 (in millions).\nThe Bank faces the following two basic types of liquidity risk: operational and contingent. The Bank maintains operational and contingent liquidity in compliance with regulatory requirements and performs a supplemental analysis to confirm that the Bank has sufficient liquidity reserves, as discussed in further detail in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources above.\nBelow is a more specific discussion of how the Bank manages its market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk, and business risk within this risk management and appetite framework.\nAdvances outstanding as of December 31, 2019 decreased by 10.4 percent, compared to December 31, 2018. As a result of shareholder demand, the majority of new advances in 2019 were short-term advances. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, 64.6 percent and 59.6 percent, respectively, of the Bank's advances were fixed rate. However, the Bank often simultaneously entered into derivatives with the issuance of advances to convert the rates, in effect, into short-term variable interest rates, the majority of which were based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, 46.7 percent and 45.3 percent, respectively, of the Bank's fixed-rate advances were swapped, and 2.03 percent and 0.47 percent, respectively, of the Bank's variable-rate advances, which contained optionality, were swapped. The majority of the Bank's variable-rate advances were indexed to LIBOR. By March 31, 2020, the Bank will cease issuing LIBOR-based advances and entering into LIBOR-based derivatives with maturities/termination dates beyond December 31, 2021. The Bank also offers variable-rate advances that may be tied to indices such as the federal funds rate, prime rate, SOFR, or constant maturity swap rates.\nFinance Agency regulations require the Bank to perform annual stress tests under various scenarios and publicly disclose a summary of the stress test results for the severely adverse scenario. The Bank filed the results of its stress test with the Finance Agency on August 27, 2019, and publicly disclosed a summary of the adverse scenario results on November 15, 2019.\nCFTC Advisory on Initial Margin Documentation Requirements. On July 9, 2019, the CFTC issued an advisory (the CFTC Advisory) on its Margin Requirements for Uncleared Swaps for Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants (the CFTC Margin Rules), to clarify that documentation governing the posting, collection, and custody of initial margin is not required to be completed until such time as the aggregate unmargined exposure to a counterparty (and its margin affiliates) exceeds an initial margin threshold of $50 million imposed by the regulation. The CFTC Advisory, however, instructs covered swap entities to closely monitor initial margin amounts if they are approaching the $50 million initial margin threshold with a counterparty and to take appropriate steps to ensure that the required documentation is in place at such time as the threshold is reached. The Bank is closely monitoring its initial margin thresholds on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis and is evaluating the impact of the CFTC Advisory on its documentation requirements.\nGeneral\nTransition of LIBOR to an Alternative Reference Rate\nNet Interest Income\nOperational Liquidity. In order to ensure adequate operational liquidity (generally, the ready cash and borrowing capacity available to meet the Bank's intraday needs) each day, Bank policy establishes a daily liquidity target based upon member deposit levels and current day liability maturities and asset settlements. The Bank met this liquidity requirement throughout 2019.\n (5) Amount in Other\u201d includes the price alignment amount on derivatives for which variation margin is characterized as daily settled contract. \nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance\nThe following tables present the net effect of derivatives and hedging activity on the Bank's results of operations (in millions):\nAs part of the Bank's risk LIBOR exposure evaluation and risk management, the Bank is developing an inventory of financial instruments impacted by the LIBOR transition and working to identify contracts that may require adding or adjusting the fallback language. The Bank has added or adjusted fallback language in advance confirmations, consolidated obligations and its credit and collateral policy to include fallback language addressing the discontinuation of LIBOR as a benchmark rate. The Bank continues to monitor the market-wide efforts to address fallback language related to derivatives and cash products.\npurchase the securities. As of December 31, 2019, these investments were 309 percent of the Bank's regulatory capital. These investments exceeded the 300 percent level due to a decrease in regulatory capital that resulted from a decrease in advances. The Bank was in compliance with this regulatory requirement at the time of its MBS purchases and will not be required to sell any previously purchased MBS. However, the Bank was precluded from purchasing additional MBS until its MBS to regulatory capital declines below 300 percent. As of December 31, 2018, the Banks MBS to regulatory capital was 290 percent of regulatory capital.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nThe Bank's board of directors and management have established a risk appetite statement and risk metrics for controlling and escalating actions based on the following eight continuing objectives that represent the foundation of the Bank's strategic and tactical planning:\n\n (2) Represents the amortization or accretion of hedging fair value adjustments for both open and closed hedge positions. \nSources of Liquidity. The Bank's principal source of liquidity is consolidated obligation debt instruments. To provide additional liquidity, the Bank also may use other short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and loans from other FHLBanks. The Bank's consolidated obligations are not obligations of the United States and are not guaranteed by either the United States or any government agency, but have historically received the same credit rating as the government bond credit rating of the United States. As a result, the Bank generally has comparatively stable access to funding through a diverse investor base at relatively favorable spreads to U.S. Treasury rates. The Bank's income and liquidity would be adversely affected if it were not able to access the capital markets at competitive rates for an extended period.\n (3) Represents interest income or expense on derivatives included in net interest income. \nThe Bank is subject to credit risk on unsecured investments, such as interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold. These investments are generally transacted with government agencies and large financial institutions that are considered to be of investment quality.\nThe following table presents the components of noninterest income (loss) (dollars in millions):\nThe Bank's 10 largest borrowing member institutions had 74.4 percent of the Bank's total advances outstanding as of December 31, 2019. Further information regarding the Bank's 10 largest borrowing member institutions and breakdown of their individual advance balances as of December 31, 2019 is contained in Item 1, Business-Credit Products-Advances. Management believes that the Bank holds sufficient collateral, on a member-specific basis, to secure the advances to all borrowers, including these 10 institutions, and the Bank does not expect to incur any credit losses on these advances.\nThe Bank's interest-rate spread was 25 basis points for 2019, compared to 28 basis points for 2018. This decrease in the Bank's interest-rate spread was primarily due to changes in interest rates as discussed above, which impacted interest expense related to interest-bearing liabilities more than the offsetting interest income related to interest-earning assets. Decreased advances balances in 2019, compared to 2018, also contributed to the decrease.\n\nInvestments\nThe following table presents the number of borrowers and the par value of advances outstanding to borrowers with the specified ratings as of the specified dates (dollars in millions).\nGeneral\nOff-balance Sheet Commitments\nSee Note 3-Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting guidance.\n(2) Includes future funding contribution for the qualified pension plan and scheduled benefit payments for the nonqualified defined benefit plans.\nThe following table presents the distribution of the Bank's total assets, liabilities, and capital by major class as of the dates indicated (dollars in millions). These items are discussed in more detail below.\n \u2022 the method used for the determination of effectiveness for transactions qualifying for hedge accounting; and \nEffective duration of equity aggregates the estimated sensitivity of market value for each of the Bank's financial assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. Effective duration of equity is computed by taking the market value-weighted effective duration of assets, less the market value-weighted effective duration of liabilities, and dividing the remainder by the market value of equity. Market value of equity is not indicative of the market value of the Bank as a going concern or the value of the Bank in a liquidation scenario. An effective duration gap is the measure of the difference between the estimated effective durations of portfolio assets and liabilities and summarizes the extent to which the estimated cash flows for assets and liabilities are matched, on average, over time and across interest-rate scenarios.\nThe Bank's board of directors and management recognize that risks are inherent to the Bank's business model and that the process of establishing a risk appetite does not imply that the Bank seeks to mitigate or eliminate all risk. By defining and managing to a specific risk appetite, the board of directors and management ensure that there is a common understanding of the Bank's desired risk profile, which enhances strategic and tactical decisions. Additionally, the Bank aspires to (1) sustain a corporate culture of transparency, integrity, and adherence to legal and ethical obligations; and (2) achieve and exceed best practices in governance, ethics, and compliance.\nCertain of the Bank's assets and liabilities, and certain collateral pledged to the Bank, are indexed to LIBOR, with exposure extending past December 31, 2021. The Bank is currently evaluating and planning for the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including the possibility of SOFR as the dominant replacement. In general, the transition away from LIBOR may result in increased market risk, credit risk, operational risk and business risk for the Bank. The Bank has adopted a LIBOR transition plan, which outlines the Bank's transition activities, including LIBOR exposure evaluation, risk management, legal, operational, systems and operations, shareholder and external communication and education, and other aspects of planning. The Bank has a LIBOR Steering Committee, which oversees the Bank's transition away from LIBOR in accordance with the strategies and requirements put forth by senior management and regulatory guidance, providing periodic reports to the Bank's executive management committee and board of directors.\nThe following table presents spreads between the average yield on total interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (dollars in millions). The interest-rate spread is affected by the inclusion or exclusion of net interest income or expense associated with the Bank's derivatives. If the derivatives do not qualify for fair-value hedge accounting under GAAP, the interest income or expense associated with the derivatives is excluded from net interest income and from the calculation of interest-rate spread and is recorded in Noninterest income (loss) as Net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities.\u201d Amortization associated with some hedging-related basis adjustments is also reflected in net interest income, which affects interest-rate spread.\nMortgage Loan Programs\nThe Bank's over-the-counter derivative transactions may either be (1) uncleared derivatives, which are executed bilaterally with a counterparty; or (2) cleared derivatives, which are cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (clearing agent) with a Derivative Clearing Organization (Clearinghouse). Once a derivative transaction has been accepted for clearing by a Clearinghouse, the executing counterparty is replaced with the Clearinghouse as the counterparty.\n \u2022 Critically Undercapitalized - FHLBank total capital is two percent or less of total assets.  Under the regulations, the Director of the Finance Agency (Director) will make a capital classification for each FHLBank at least quarterly and notify the FHLBank in writing of any proposed action and provide an opportunity for the FHLBank to submit information relevant to such action. The Director is permitted to make discretionary classifications. An FHLBank must provide written notice to the Finance Agency within 10 days of any event or development that has caused or is likely to cause its permanent or total capital to fall below the level required to maintain its most recent capital classification or reclassification. In the event that an FHLBank is not adequately capitalized, the regulations delineate the types of prompt corrective actions that the Director may order, including submission of a capital restoration plan by the FHLBank and restrictions on its dividends, stock redemptions, executive compensation, new business activities, or any other actions the Director determines will ensure safe and sound operations and capital compliance by the FHLBank. On December 13, 2019, the Bank received notification from the Director that, based on September 30, 2019 data, the Bank meets the definition of adequately capitalized.\u201d\nThe Bank also analyzes its interest-rate risk and market exposure by evaluating the theoretical market value of equity. The market value of equity represents the net result of the present value of future cash flows discounted to arrive at the theoretical market value of each balance sheet item. By using the discounted present value of future cash flows, the Bank is able to factor in the various maturities of assets and liabilities, similar to the effective duration analysis discussed above. The Bank determines the theoretical market value of assets and liabilities utilizing a Level 3 pricing approach as more fully described in Note 18-Estimated Fair Values to the Bank's 2019 audited financial statements. The difference between the market value of total assets and the market value of total liabilities is the market value of equity. A more volatile market value of equity under different shock scenarios tends to result in a higher effective duration of equity, indicating increased sensitivity to interest rate changes.\n (4) Includes only those gains or losses on trading securities or financial instruments held at fair value that have an economic derivative assigned;\u201d therefore, this line item may not agree to the income statement. \n (1) Volume change is calculated as the change in volume multiplied by the previous rate, while rate change is calculated as the change in rate multiplied by the previous volume. The rate/volume change, calculated as the change in rate multiplied by the change in volume, is allocated between volume change and rate change at the ratio each component bears to the absolute value of its total. \nFor disclosure purposes, the Bank classifies private-label MBS as either prime or Alt-A based upon the overall credit quality of the underlying loans as determined by the originator at the time of origination, unless otherwise noted. Although there is no universally accepted definition of Alt-A, generally, loans with credit characteristics that range between prime and subprime are classified as Alt-A. Participants in the mortgage market have used the Alt-A classification principally to describe loans for which the underwriting process has been streamlined in order to reduce the documentation requirements of the borrower or allow for alternative documentation.\nNet Income\n (2) Includes amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral paid under master netting agreements with derivative counterparties. \nBank policy requires the Bank to maintain its effective duration of equity within a range of plus five years to minus five years, assuming current interest rates, and within a range of plus seven years to minus seven years, assuming an instantaneous parallel increase or decrease in market interest rates of 200 basis points.\nLiquidity Risk\nNon-MBS Held-to-maturity Securities\n\n\nThe unrealized losses related to non-MBS held-to-maturity securities are caused by interest-rate changes. These losses are considered temporary as the Bank expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis on its non-MBS held-to-maturity securities in unrealized loss positions and neither intends to sell these securities nor considers it more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before its anticipated recovery of each security's remaining amortized cost basis. As a result, Bank does not consider these non-MBS held-to-maturity securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2019.\nThe state of the economy is a significant component in determining the Bank's overall business outlook as it impacts advance demand, asset and collateral values, member financial stability, funding costs, and many other facets of the Bank's portfolio. While the U.S. economy continued to experience growth in 2019, factors such as interest rates, liquidity levels at member institutions, fiscal and monetary policies, performance of global economies, and regulatory changes could have a significant effect either positive or negative on the Bank's financial performance.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the Bank documents the following concurrently with the execution of each hedging relationship:\nContingency plans are in place that prioritize the allocation of liquidity resources in the event of operational disruptions at the Bank or the Office of Finance. Under the FHLBank Act, the Secretary of Treasury has the authority, at his discretion, to purchase consolidated obligations up to an aggregate amount of $4.0 billion. No borrowings under this authority have been outstanding since 1977.\nSupplementary financial data on the Bank's short-term borrowings is set forth under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Supplementary Financial Information (Unaudited).\nThe Bank categorizes its financial instruments carried at fair value into a three-level classification in accordance with GAAP. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency (observable or unobservable) of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Bank's market assumptions. The Bank utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nBeginning on January 1, 2019, changes in fair value of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk for designated fair value hedges are recorded in net interest income in the same line as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Prior to January 1, 2019, for fair value hedges, any hedge ineffectiveness (which represented the amount by which the change in the fair value of the derivative differed from the change in the fair value of the hedge item) was recorded in noninterest income as net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities.\n \u2022 determination of the appropriate accounting designation; \n (1) Federal funds sold includes $100 million with BankUnited, National Association, one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2019.  (2) Interest-bearing deposits include a $508 million business money market account with Truist Bank, one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2019.\nThe FHLBank Act affords any security interest granted to the Bank by any member of the Bank, or any affiliate of any such member, priority over the claims and rights of any party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor) other than the claims and rights of a party that (1) would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law; and (2) is an actual bona fide purchaser for value or is an actual secured party whose security interest is perfected in accordance with applicable state law.\n (1) Investment amounts noted in the above table represent the carrying value and excludes related accrued interest receivable of $44 million as of December 31, 2019. \n(1) The classification of securities is based on current characteristics and performance, which may be different from the securities' classification as determined\nby the originator at the time of origination.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\n\nThe board of directors has an Enterprise Risk and Operations Committee (EROC) to advise and assist the board with respect to enterprise risk management, operations, information technology, and other related matters. In addition, the Bank's internal Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) is responsible for the management and oversight of the Bank's risk management programs and practices. Additionally, the Bank's Internal Audit department, which reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Bank's board of directors, regularly tests compliance with the policies and procedures related to managing operational risks.\nThe prepayment options embedded in mortgage loan and mortgage security assets may shorten or lengthen both the actual and expected cash flows when interest rates change. Current Finance Agency policies limit this source of interest-rate risk by\nBusiness Outlook\nInterest rates are also a significant factor on the Bank's business outlook. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates during 2017 and 2018, and then lowered interest rates during 2019. There is uncertainty as to whether rates in 2020 will move up, down, or remain stable. This uncertainty can impact the Bank's interest rate risk management, profitability, and ROE. It can also impact member advance demand, as rate uncertainty can impact deposit levels at members.\nUse of Derivatives\n \u2022 the hedging strategy; \nThe Bank is subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to its derivative transactions. The amount of credit risk on derivatives depends on the extent to which netting procedures, collateral requirements, and other credit enhancements are used and are effective in mitigating the risk. The Bank manages credit risk through credit analysis, collateral management, and other credit enhancements. The Bank is also required to follow the requirements set forth by applicable regulations.\nBusiness Risk\n (4) Nonperforming mortgage loans are included in average balances used to determine average rate. \n (2) Interest-bearing deposits include a $409 million business money market account with Branch Bank and Trust, one of the Bank's 10 largest borrowers as of December 31, 2018.  (3) Amounts do not reflect collateral; see the table under Risk Management-Credit Risk-Derivatives below for a breakdown of the credit ratings of and the Bank's credit exposure to derivative counterparties, including net exposure after collateral.\n \u2022 As a fair-value hedge of an underlying financial instrument or a firm commitment. For example, the Bank uses derivatives to reduce the interest-rate net sensitivity of consolidated obligations, advances, and investments by, in effect, converting them to a short-term interest rate. The Bank also uses derivatives to manage embedded options in assets and liabilities and to hedge the market value of existing assets and liabilities. The Bank's management reevaluates its hedging strategies from time to time and may change the hedging techniques used or adopt new strategies as deemed prudent. \nbeyond 2021, the Bank has begun updating its systems, participating in the issuance of SOFR-indexed consolidated bonds, issuing SOFR-linked advances, and swapping certain financial instruments to OIS and SOFR as an alternative interest rate hedging strategy for certain financial instruments. The pace of transition, however, is dependent on external factors, including market developments and demand. The Bank closely monitors and participates in industry activity related to LIBOR transition, including those of the Alternate Reference Rate Committee and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. The Bank will update its pledged collateral certification reporting requirements as of March 31, 2020 so that members may distinguish LIBOR-linked collateral maturing past December 31, 2021. The Bank intends to utilize this information in connection with its LIBOR exposure evaluation and risk management.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Bank ceased purchasing assets tied to LIBOR with a contractual maturity beyond December 31, 2021. In light of this change, the Bank is evaluating its investment and related hedging strategy, including the availability of alternate permissible investments. In addition, beginning March 31, 2020, the Bank will cease entering into new LIBOR-based transactions involving advances, debt, derivatives, or other products with maturities beyond December 31, 2021. In preparation for this change and to help manage balance sheet exposure to LIBOR-indexed assets and liabilities with maturities\nThe Bank may discontinue hedge accounting for a hedging transaction (de-designation) if it fails effectiveness testing or for other asset-liability-management reasons. The Bank also treats modifications to hedged items as a discontinuance of a hedging relationship. When a hedging relationship is discontinued, the Bank will cease marking the hedged item to fair value and will amortize the cumulative basis adjustment resulting from hedge accounting. The Bank reports related amortization as interest income or expense over the remaining life of the associated hedged item. The associated derivative will continue to be marked to fair value through earnings until it matures or is terminated.\nThe decrease in mortgage loans held for portfolio from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the maturity and prepayments of these assets during the year.\nThe decrease in net interest income during 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily due to a decrease in outstanding advances during 2019 compared to 2018. Additionally, changes in interest rates and their subsequent impact on the Bank's derivative positions, interest-earning assets, and interest-bearing liabilities contributed to the decrease in net interest income. These changes in interest rates impacted interest expense related to interest-bearing liabilities more that the offsetting interest income related to interest-earning assets.\n (5) Includes amounts recognized for the right to return cash collateral received under master netting agreements with derivative counterparties. \nThe Liquidity Guidance AB's measurements of liquidity include a cash flow scenario, on a daily basis, that projects forward the number of days for which the Bank should maintain positive cash balances assuming the renewal of all maturing advances and the maintenance of a liquidity reserve for outstanding standby letters of credit. The measurements of liquidity also include a funding gap measurement of the difference between assets and liabilities that are scheduled to mature during a specified period, expressed as a percentage of the Bank's total assets to reduce the liquidity risks associated with a mismatch in asset and liability maturities, including an undue reliance on short-term debt funding, which may increase debt rollover risk.\nCyber-Related Risks. The efficiencies offered by information technology (IT) are necessary components of Bank operations. The IT architecture supports multiple operating systems, database structures, and virtualized servers to support business applications that are a mixture of vendor-licensed and in-house developed. Cyber-attacks are increasing globally across all business sectors and cyber attackers are finding more ways to penetrate organizations' systems. Cybersecurity threats can result in damage to the Bank's physical facilities, technology systems, and/or the Bank's intangible assets. Successful attacks can have a financial, legal, and reputational impact on the Bank as well as disrupt the Bank's ability to serve its shareholders.\nThe decrease in total noninterest income during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to increased prepayments of restructured and redesignated advances during 2017, which resulted in $307 million of accelerated amortization during 2017. This accelerated amortization reduced net interest income during 2017 and was offset by a corresponding increase in net gains on derivatives and hedging activities. The remaining changes in derivatives and hedging activities were primarily related to changes in interest rates.\nThe Bank's board of directors, through EROC, oversees the major dimensions of the Bank's information technology program including management information systems to ensure alignment with the Bank's strategic plan, risk management activities, and operational performance standards. In that role, EROC oversees the development, implementation and maintenance of the Bank's information security program including recommending action to the board with respect to the Bank's information security policy on an annual basis and reviewing reports on the effectiveness of the Bank's information security program. The Bank's internal ERC reviews and reports to the board on the risk exposures and risk appetites of the Bank, including those related to information technology. In addition, the Bank's internal Information Technology Governance Committee oversees IT governance, including: IT risk management and IT operational performance, and the Bank's internal Security Governance Committee provides independent and integrated oversight of the information security program. Each of these committees provide information and make recommendations to the board, through the Bank's executive management committee, regarding their respective oversight authority.\n____________\nThe board and management recognize that risk and risk producing events are dynamic and constantly being presented. Accordingly, the Bank believes that reporting, analyzing, and mitigating risks are paramount to successful corporate governance.\nLiquidity is necessary to satisfy members' borrowing needs on a timely basis, repay maturing and called consolidated obligations, and meet other obligations and operating requirements. Many members rely on the Bank as a source of standby liquidity, so the Bank attempts to be in a position to meet member funding needs on a timely basis. The Bank is required to maintain liquidity in accordance with the FHLBank Act, Finance Agency regulations, and policies established by the Bank's management and board of directors. In addition, the Finance Agency, at times, has issued guidance and expectations to the FHLBanks related to liquidity.\n (3) Represents interest income or expense on derivatives included in net interest income. \nMargin and Capital Requirements for Covered Swap Entities. On November 7, 2019, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Farm Credit Administration and the Finance Agency (collectively, the Agencies) jointly published a proposed rule that, in addition to other changes, would amend the Agencies' regulations that established minimum margin and capital requirements for uncleared swaps (the prudential margin rules) for covered swap entities under the jurisdiction of one of the Agencies. In addition to other changes, the proposed amendments would permit those uncleared swaps entered into by a covered swap entity before the compliance date of the prudential margin rules to retain their legacy status and not become subject to the prudential margin rules in the event that such legacy swaps are amended to replace LIBOR or another rate that is reasonably expected to be discontinued or is reasonably determined to have lost its relevance as a reliable benchmark due to a significant impairment. Among other things, the proposed rule would also amend the prudential margin rules to (i) extend the phase-in compliance date of the covered swap entities for initial margin requirements from September 1, 2020 to September 1, 2021 for counterparties with an average daily aggregate notional amount (AANA) of non-cleared swaps from $8 billion to $50 billion, (ii) clarify that an Agency covered swap entity does not have to execute initial margin trading documentation with a counterparty prior to the time that the counterparty is required to collect or post initial margin, and (iii) permit legacy swaps to retain their legacy status and not become\n \u2022 the fair value of fixed-rate investments and mortgage loans held in portfolio decreases; and \nSupplementary financial data on

performance and condition for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to prior years. Key points include:\n\n- Net income was $367 million in 2019, a decrease of 11.9% from 2018, primarily due to lower net interest income resulting from decreased advance balances and changes in interest rates. \n\n- Total assets were $149.9 billion at December 31, 2019, down 2.99% from 2018, mainly due to lower advance balances.\n\n- Advances, the Bank's largest asset, decreased 10.4% to $97.2 billion at year-end 2019 compared to 2018.\n\n- Investments increased 14.2% to $50.6 billion, partly to meet new liquidity requirements. \n\n- Consolidated obligations, the main funding source, decreased 3.1% to $140.6 billion.\n\n- The net interest spread declined to 25 basis points in 2019 from 28 basis points in 2018, mostly due to the impact of interest rate changes.\n\n- Return on equity was 5.09% in 2019 versus 5.54% in 2018. \n\n- The Bank is focused on managing the transition away from LIBOR and has stopped purchasing LIBOR-based assets maturing after 2021.\n\n- Credit quality remains solid with no allowance for losses on advances. Regulatory capital ratios were stable and above required minimums.\n\nIn summary, the Bank's financial performance declined in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower net interest income, but it remains sound overall. The Bank is proactively managing the LIBOR transition and other risks."}
