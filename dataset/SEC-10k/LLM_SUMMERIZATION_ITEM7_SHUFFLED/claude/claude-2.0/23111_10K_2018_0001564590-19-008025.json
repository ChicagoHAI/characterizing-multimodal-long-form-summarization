The pace of technology advances and changes in business requirements and practices of our clients all have a significant impact on the demand for the services that we provide. Competition for new engagements and pricing pressure has been strong. Throughout 2017 and 2016, many of our healthcare clients did not begin new projects when existing projects ended due to their capital constraints. The demand for the Company's IT solutions business, primarily in our healthcare vertical market in North America improved in 2018 as spending increased along with the improving economy. Additionally, the demand for our IT staffing and other services from certain of our large staffing clients increased during 2018.\nThe Company primarily operates in one industry segment, providing IT services to its clients. These services include IT solutions and IT and other staffing. With IT solutions services, we generally take responsibility for the deliverables on a project and the services may include high-end consulting. When providing IT and other staffing services, we typically supply personnel to our clients who then, in turn, take their direction from the client's managers. The Company at times provides administrative or warehouse employees to clients to supplement the IT staffing resources we place at those clients.\nIT solutions and IT and other staffing revenue as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is as follows:\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> IT solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> IT and other staffing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company promotes a majority of its services through five vertical market focus areas: technology service providers, manufacturing, healthcare (which includes services provided to healthcare providers, health insurers (payers), and life sciences companies), financial services, and energy. The remainder of CTG's revenue is derived from general markets.\nCTG's revenue by vertical market as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is as follows:\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology service providers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Healthcare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General markets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe IT services industry is extremely competitive and characterized by continuous changes in client requirements and improvements in technologies. Our competition varies significantly by geographic region, as well as by the type of service provided. Many of our competitors are larger than CTG, and have greater financial, technical, sales, and marketing resources. In addition, the Company frequently competes with a client's own internal IT staff. Our industry is being impacted by the growing use of lower-cost offshore delivery capabilities (primarily India and other parts of Asia). There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully with existing or future competitors or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised good or service is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. For time-and-material contracts, revenue is recognized as hours are incurred and costs are expended. For contracts with progress billing schedules, primarily monthly, revenue is recognized as services are rendered to the customer. Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognized over time using an input-based approach. Over time revenue recognition best portrays the Company's performance in transferring control of the goods or services to the customer. On most fixed price contracts, revenue recognition is supported through contractual clauses that require the customer to pay for work performed to date, including cost plus a reasonable profit margin, for goods or services that have no alternative use to the Company. On certain contracts, revenue recognition is supported through contractual clauses that indicate the customer controls the asset, or work in process, as the Company creates or enhances the asset. On a given project, actual salary and indirect labor costs incurred are measured and compared with the total estimate of costs of such items at the completion of the project. Revenue is recognized based upon the percentage-of-completion calculation of total incurred costs to total estimated costs. The Company infrequently works on fixed-price projects that include significant amounts of material or other non-labor related costs that could distort the percent complete within a percentage-of-completion calculation. The Company's estimate of the total labor costs it expects to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our experience on similar projects, and includes management judgments and estimates that affect the amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts in any accounting period. Losses on fixed-price projects are recorded when identified.\nThe Company's revenue from contracts accounted for under time-and-material, progress billing, and percentage-of-completion methods as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is as follows:\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

</tr>\n</table>\nReimbursable expenses billed to clients and included in revenue totaled $3.2 million and $3.3 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe revenue increase in North America in 2018 as compared with 2017 was primarily due to a significant increase in demand for the Company's IT solutions business, primarily in our healthcare vertical market, and a modest increase in demand for our IT staffing business, primarily in our technology services provider vertical market. The revenue increase in Europe is primarily due to strong demand for the Company's services in the European markets we serve, and the acquisition of Soft Company on February 15, 2018, which has an annual revenue of approximately $30 million.\nOn a consolidated basis, IT solutions revenue increased $21.7 million or 23.7% in 2018 as compared with 2017. 2018 The increase is primarily due to an increase in IT solutions services in Europe and the addition of Soft Company, which was acquired on February 15, 2018. Soft Company primarily specializes in providing IT services to finance, insurance, telecom, and media services companies. The increase was also due in part to our strategy to shift to non-electronic health records (EHR) services in our healthcare vertical market. The Company expanded its healthcare IT business development team in 2018 with individuals who have experience selling healthcare IT services such as advisory and technical services, outsourcing, and staff augmentation. This team was successful in driving revenue growth in this vertical market and expanding the non-EHR healthcare related services we provide.\nAlso on a consolidated basis, IT and other staffing revenue increased $35.9 million or 17.1% during 2018 as compared with 2017. The IT staffing increase was primarily due to the addition of Soft Company in the 2018 first quarter, growth in IT staffing in North America, and in part due to a change in accounting related to the new revenue recognition standard which requires revenue we previously recorded on a net basis to now be recorded on a gross basis for billable subcontractors. The Company recorded $4.6 million, or 1.3% of our 2018 consolidated revenue on a gross basis, which would have been recorded on a net basis under the Company's historic accounting under Topic 605. This accounting change solely related to the IT and other staffing services.\nFollowing the acquisition of Soft Company, which relies heavily on billable subcontractors, we have revised how we define and calculate headcount in order to report all billable consultants, including both employees and subcontractors. Based on this new approach, the Company's headcount was approximately 4,150 at December 31, 2018, which was a 22.1% increase from approximately 3,400 billable consultants at December 31, 2017. Approximately 92% of this headcount is for technical resources and 8% for support positions.\nThe significant increase in revenue in the Company's European operations in 2018 as compared with the corresponding 2017 period was due to an increase in demand for the Company's IT solutions services across a number of the vertical markets we serve, and the strength relative to the U.S. dollar of the currencies in Belgium, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, the countries in which the Company's European subsidiaries operate. In Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, the functional currency is the Euro, while in the United Kingdom the functional currency is the British Pound. In 2018 as compared with 2017, the average value of the Euro increased 4.5%, and the average value of the British Pound increased 3.6%. A significant portion of the Company's revenue from its European operations is generated in Belgium and Luxembourg. Had there been no change in these exchange rates from 2017 to 2018, total European revenue would have been approximately $4.9 million lower, or $121.2 million as compared with the $126.1 million reported. When considering the year-over-year change in revenue in constant currencies, revenue from our European operations increased 49%. Operating income increased by $0.3 million in 2018 as compared with 2017 given the change in the exchange rates year-over-year.\nThe Company continues to assess the potential impact, if any, that the United Kingdom's proposed exit from the European Union will have on the Company's operations. As the total revenue generated by our British subsidiary is immaterial when compared with the Company's total consolidated revenue, we do not expect the impact of the pending exit to have a material impact on the Company's operations.\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was CTG's largest client and accounted for $80.6 million or 22.5% and $76.4 million or 25.4% of the Company's consolidated revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the 2017 third quarter, the National Technical Services Agreement with IBM was extended for two years and now expires on December 31, 2019. As part of the National Technical Services Agreement, the Company also provides its services as a predominant supplier to IBM's Integrated Technology Services and the Systems and Technology Group business units. This agreement accounted for approximately 72% of all of the services provided to IBM by the Company in 2018. The Company's accounts receivable from IBM at December 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled $22.1 million and $21.5 million, respectively.\nSDI was the Company's second largest client and accounted for $27.6 million or 7.7% and $34.2 million or 11.4% of the Company's consolidated revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. SDI acts as a vendor manager for Lenovo, and all of the Company's revenue generated through SDI relates to CTG employees working at Lenovo. The Company's accounts receivable from SDI at December 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled $3.6 million and $4.7 million, respectively.\nWe expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from IBM and SDI in future years; however a significant decline or the loss of the revenue from these clients would have a significant negative effect on our operating results. No other client accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenue in 2018 or 2017.\nDirect costs, defined as costs for billable staff including billable out-of-pocket expenses, were 80.9% and 81.4% of consolidated revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Direct costs in 2018 were impacted by higher fringe benefit costs than planned. In the 2017 third quarter, the Company recorded a significant increase in fringe benefit costs primarily consisting of medical expense. The increase in medical expense, which totaled approximately $1.0 million in direct costs, was due to much higher utilization of the Company's self-insured medical plan during the year. The Company also recorded $0.4 million of severance charges in the 2017 second quarter. When considering these items, direct costs as a percentage of revenue in 2018 were comparable with 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 18.5% of revenue in 2018 as compared with 17.2% of revenue in 2017. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2018 as compared with 2017 is primarily due to costs incurred by our operating units as the Company continues to make investments in sales, recruiting, and delivery resources in order to focus on the Company's long-term growth. Additionally, SG&A in 2018 includes acquisition-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of Soft Company, totaling $2.0 million, and $0.7 million in severance.\nOperating income was 0.6% of revenue in 2018 as compared with 1.4% of revenue in 2017. The operating loss from the North American operations was $2.4 million in 2018 compared with $0.1 million in 2017. The 2018 loss was impacted by investments in business development, recruiting, and marketing of nearly $3.5 million, some of which have yet to generate revenue and profits. Additionally, the Company recorded $2.0 million in acquisition related costs, and $0.7 million in severance. Operating income in 2017 was reduced by a total of $2.0 million from unusually high utilization of the Company's self-insured medical plan, and severance.\nOperating income from our European operations was $5.3 million in 2018 compared with $4.0 million in 2017. The increase in operating income in 2018 compared with 2017 is primarily due to strong demand for the Company's services in the European markets we serve, and the acquisition of Soft Company completed in February 2018.\nOther income (expense) was 0.1% of revenue in 2018 and 0.0% of revenue in 2017. In 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded a non-taxable life insurance gain of approximately $0.8 and $0.4 million, respectively, as one of its former executives passed away in each year.\nThe Company's effective tax rate (ETR) is calculated based upon the full year's operating results and various tax related items. The ETR in 2018 was 224%, while the 2017 ETR was 80.1%.\nThe ETR was high in 2018 primarily due to the Company recording a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets in the U.S. totaling $3.8 million as the Company has recurring pre-tax losses in recent years, cumulative pre-tax losses from 2016 to 2018, and uncertainty as to income in future years. The Company also incurred approximately $0.7 million of tax associated with the GILTI provisions of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and $0.3 million of tax from non-deductible acquisition related costs in our foreign operations. These items, which caused additional tax expense, were offset by a non-taxable life insurance gain, the reversal of the valuation for deferred tax assets in the United Kingdom, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which reduced the US federal corporate tax rate to 21%, and tax benefits for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and Research and Development tax credit (R&D).\nThe ETR was high in 2017 primarily due to the effects of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act which resulted in the Company reducing its U.S. deferred tax assets by $1.7 million, and the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\u201d which required the Company to record additional tax expense of $0.3 million for shortfalls that would previously have been recorded to capital in excess of par value on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. This additional tax expense was partially offset by tax benefits for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and Research and Development tax credit (R&D).\nNet loss for 2018 was (0.8)% of revenue or $(0.20) per diluted share, compared with net income of 0.3% of revenue or $0.05 per diluted share in 2017. Diluted earnings per share were calculated using 13.8 million weighted-average equivalent shares outstanding in 2018 and 15.3 million in 2017. The decrease in shares year-over-year is due to the Company's Dutch auction tender offer where the Company repurchased approximately 10% of its outstanding shares in April 2018.\n2017 as compared with 2016\nThe Company recorded revenue in 2017 and 2016 as follows:\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year-Over-\nYear Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 220,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 254,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Europe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 301,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 324,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReimbursable expenses billed to clients and included in revenue totaled $3.3 million and $4.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in reimbursable expenses year-over-year is primarily due to a reduction in the number of consultants in our healthcare vertical market, as many of those employees travel to client locations to perform services.\nThe revenue decrease in North America in 2017 as compared with 2016 was primarily due to a significant decrease in demand for the Company's IT staffing business, primarily in our technology service provider vertical market, and a decrease in demand for our IT solutions services business, primarily in our healthcare vertical market. The revenue increase in Europe is primarily due to strong demand for the Company's services in the European markets we serve.\nOn a consolidated basis, IT solutions revenue decreased $3.3 million or 3.5% in 2017 as compared with 2016. Beginning in late 2014, the Company began to see significant reductions in billable resources at a number of its larger healthcare clients which decreased IT solutions revenue in the Company's healthcare vertical market as existing electronic health records (EHR) projects came to an end. This decrease in spending on healthcare IT projects continued throughout 2017 for the clients that we serve. As part of our strategy to shift to non-EHR services, the Company expanded its healthcare IT business development team in 2017 with individuals who have experience selling healthcare IT services such as advisory and technical services, outsourcing, and staff augmentation. However, in 2017, this team as a whole was not successful in reducing our revenue losses in this vertical market and expanding the non-EHR healthcare related services we provide.\nAlso on a consolidated basis, IT and other staffing revenue decreased $20.3 million or 8.8% during 2017 as compared with 2016. The IT staffing decrease was primarily due to a decrease in demand from a number of the Company's largest staffing clients. Additionally, there was a significant reduction in both requirements and billable rates for certain of the employees provided to our largest staffing client which began to impact the Company in the 2016 fourth quarter.\nThe Company's headcount was approximately 3,200 employees at December 31, 2017, which was a 7% decrease from approximately 3,450 employees at December 31, 2016. Approximately 90% of this headcount was for technical resources and 10% for support positions.\nThe significant increase in revenue in the Company's European operations in 2017 as compared with the corresponding 2016 period was due to an increase in demand for the Company's IT solutions services across a number of the vertical markets we serve and the strength relative to the U.S. dollar of the currencies in Belgium and Luxembourg, partially offset by weakness relative to the U.S. dollar of the currency of the United Kingdom, the countries in which the Company's European subsidiaries operate. In Belgium and Luxembourg, the functional currency is the Euro, while in the United Kingdom the functional currency is the British Pound. In 2017 as compared with 2016, the average value of the Euro increased 2.1%, and the average value of the British Pound decreased 4.9%. A significant portion of the Company's revenue from its European operations is generated in Belgium and Luxembourg. Had there been no change in these exchange rates from 2016 to 2017, total European revenue would have been approximately $1.4 million lower, or $79.7 million as compared with the $81.1 million reported. When considering the year-over-year change in revenue in constant currencies, revenue from our European operations increased 12.9%. Operating income increased by less than $0.1 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 given the change in the exchange rates year-over-year.\nThe Company continues to assess the potential impact, if any, that the United Kingdom's proposed exit from the European Union will have on the Company's operations. As the total revenue generated by our British subsidiary is immaterial when compared with the Company's total consolidated revenue, we do not expect the impact of the pending exit to have a material impact on the Company's operations.\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was CTG's largest client and accounted for $76.4 million or 25.4% and $98.4 million or 30.3% of the Company's consolidated revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the 2017 third quarter, the National Technical Services Agreement with IBM was extended for two years and now expires on December 31, 2019. As part of the National Technical Services Agreement, the Company also provides its services as a predominant supplier to IBM's Integrated Technology Services and the Systems and Technology Group business units. This agreement accounted for approximately 85% of all of the services provided to IBM by the Company in 2017. As previously mentioned, the reduction in revenue in 2017 as compared with 2016 is due to a reduction in both the number of requirements and bill rates for certain employees provided to this client beginning in the 2016 fourth quarter. The Company's accounts receivable from IBM at December 31, 2017 and 2016 totaled $21.5 million and $28.0 million, respectively.\nSDI was the Company's second largest client and accounted for $34.2 million or 11.4% and $34.5 million or 10.6% of the Company's consolidated revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively. SDI acts as a vendor manager for Lenovo, and all of the Company's revenue generated through SDI relates to CTG employees working at Lenovo. The Company's accounts receivable from SDI at December 31,2017 and 2016 totaled $4.7 million and $5.6 million, respectively.\nNo other client accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenue in 2017 or 2016.\nDirect costs, defined as costs for billable staff including billable out-of-pocket expenses, were 81.4% and 81.8% of consolidated revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In the 2017 third quarter, the Company recorded a significant increase in fringe benefit costs primarily consisting of medical expense. The increase in medical expense, which totaled approximately $1.0 million in direct costs, was due to much higher utilization of the Company's self-insured medical plan during the year. The Company also recorded $0.4 million of severance charges in the 2017 second quarter. In the 2016 second quarter, the Company's European operations recorded a payroll tax credit totaling approximately $0.7 million which reduced direct costs in 2016. The credited amounts returned certain costs incurred from 2011 to 2014, and the Company does not anticipate a significant credit in the future. When considering these items, direct costs as a percentage of revenue in 2017 decreased as compared with 2016. This decrease was in part due to the significant reduction in IT staffing revenue. These services are provided to the Company's largest IT staffing clients, which have much higher direct costs as a percentage of revenue as compared with the Company's IT solutions clients.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 17.3% of revenue in 2017 as compared with 17.0% of revenue in 2016. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2017 as compared with 2016 is primarily due to costs incurred by our operating units as the Company continues to make investments in sales, recruiting and\ndelivery resources in order to focus on the Company's long-term growth, and the loss of operating leverage from a decrease in revenue. Additionally, severance incurred for the resignation of three former executives totaled $0.4 million and $1.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDuring the 2016 first quarter, the Company determined that a goodwill impairment indicator existed which required an interim impairment analysis. As a result of the analysis, the Company determined the implied fair value of its goodwill balance was below the carrying value. Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $21.5 million to reduce the value of its goodwill balance to the implied fair value. Additionally, during the 2016 third quarter, the Company determined that another goodwill impairment indicator existed which required a second interim impairment analysis. As a result of the analysis, the Company determined the implied fair value of its goodwill balance was again below the carrying value. Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $15.8 million to reduce the value of its goodwill balance to the implied fair value, which reduced the Company's goodwill balance to $0.0.\nThe significant increase in operating income in 2017 was due to the goodwill impairment charges taken in the 2016 first and third quarters totaling $37.3 million. Operating income (loss) was 1.3% of revenue in 2017 as compared with (10.3)% of revenue in 2016. Operating loss from North American operations was reduced by $1.2 million of unexpected costs associated with the Company's self-insurance medical plan, and $0.8 million for severance charges for former executives, or $2.0 million in total, and was $0.1 million in 2017 compared with $35.7 million in 2016.\nOperating income from our European operations was $4.0 million in 2017 compared with $2.4 million in 2016. The increase in operating income in 2017 compared with 2016 is primarily due to an increase in revenue due to strong demand for the Company's services in the European markets we serve. The 2016 results in Europe were reduced by a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $1.7 million, offset by a payroll tax credit of $0.7 million recorded in the 2016 second quarter.\nOther income (expense) was 0.1% of revenue in 2017 and (0.1)% of revenue in 2016. In 2017, the Company recorded a non-taxable life insurance gain of approximately $0.4 million as one of its former executives passed away in the 2017 fourth quarter.\nThe Company's effective tax rate (ETR) is calculated based upon the full year's operating results and various tax related items. The ETR in 2017 was 80.1%, while the 2016 ETR was (3.3)%.\nThe ETR was higher than the normal range in 2017 primarily due to the effects of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act which resulted in the Company reducing its U.S. deferred tax assets by $1.7 million and the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\u201d which required the Company to record approximately $0.3 million in 2017 of additional tax expense for shortfalls that would previously have been recorded to capital in excess of par value on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. This additional tax expense was partially offset by tax benefits for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and Research and Development tax credit (R&D).\nThe ETR was lower than the normal range in 2016 primarily due to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges totaling $37.3 million in the 2016 first and third quarters, and also due to the extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and the Research and Development tax credit (R&D) which were renewed by the U.S. federal government in the 2015 fourth quarter and were effective for all of 2016. These credits totaled approximately $0.6 million.\nNet income for 2017 was 0.3% of revenue or $0.05 per diluted share, compared with net loss of (10.7)% of revenue or $(2.22) per diluted share in 2016. Diluted earnings per share were calculated using 15.3 million weighted-average equivalent shares outstanding in 2017 and 15.6 million in 2016. The decrease in shares year-over-year is due to the Company's stock repurchase program. The Company purchased approximately 1.2 million shares of its stock for treasury during 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company's management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company's significant accounting policies are included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by the Company's management in their application, have a significant impact on the\nCompany's consolidated financial statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company's financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company's critical accounting policy is related to the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes.\nIncome Taxes-Valuation Allowances on Deferred Tax Assets\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had a total of approximately $0.8 million of deferred tax assets, and approximately $1.6 million of deferred tax liabilities recorded on its consolidated balance sheet. During the 2018 fourth quarter, the Company made the determination to establish a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets in the U.S. given recurring losses in those operations, a cumulative loss from 2016 to 2018, and the uncertainty of income in future years. The deferred tax assets, net, primarily consist of deferred compensation, loss carryforwards, and state taxes. The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period are determined based upon the changes in differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for tax purposes, as measured by the enacted tax rates when these differences are estimated to reverse. The Company has made certain assumptions regarding the timing of the reversal of these assets and liabilities, and whether taxable income in future periods will be sufficient to recognize all or a part of any gross deferred tax asset of the Company.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had deferred tax assets recorded resulting from net operating losses in previous years totaling approximately $1.0 million. The Company has analyzed each jurisdiction's tax position, including forecasting potential taxable income in future periods and the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards as applicable, and determined that it is unclear whether all of these deferred tax assets will be realized at any point in the future. Accordingly, at December 31, 2018, the Company had offset a portion of these assets with a valuation allowance totaling approximately $0.3 million, resulting in a net deferred tax asset from net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $0.7 million.\nThe Company's deferred tax assets and their potential realizability are evaluated each quarter to determine if any changes should be made to the valuation allowance. Any change in the valuation allowance in the future could result in a change in the Company's ETR. A 1% change in the ETR in 2018 would have increased or decreased net income by approximately $22,700, or less than $0.01 per diluted share.\nOther Estimates\nThe Company has also made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of its assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare the consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, the FASB, and other regulatory authorities. Such estimates primarily relate to the valuation of stock options for recording equity-based compensation expense, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, investment valuation, discount rates associated with pension plans, incurred but not reported healthcare claims, legal matters, and estimates of progress toward completion and direct profit or loss on contracts, as applicable. As future events and their effect on the Company's operating results cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from these estimates. Changes in the economic climates in which the Company operates may affect these estimates and will be reflected in the Company's financial statements in the event they occur.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $(0.3) million, $9.2 million, and $2.4 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. In 2018, net loss was $(2.8) million, while other non-cash adjustments, primarily consisting of depreciation expense, equity-based compensation, deferred income taxes, deferred compensation, and non-taxable life insurance gain totaled $6.3 million. In 2017 and 2016, net income (loss) was $0.8 million and $(34.6) million, respectively, while the corresponding non-cash adjustments netted to $4.5 million and $40.3 million, respectively.\nAccounts receivable balances increased $8.7 million in 2018 as compared with 2017, decreased $5.2 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, and increased $0.7 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. The increase in the accounts receivable balance in 2018 resulted from an increase in revenue of 24.8% in the 2018 fourth quarter as compared with the 2017 fourth quarter. Despite the increase in 2018 fourth quarter revenue, the Company experienced a decrease in days sales outstanding (DSO) due an acceleration of cash collection from several customers. DSO is calculated by dividing accounts receivable obtained from the consolidated balance sheet by average daily revenue for the fourth quarter of the respective year. DSO was 82 days at December 31, 2018 as compared with DSO at December 31, 2017 of 86 days. DSO was 86 days at December 31, 2017 as compared with DSO at December 31, 2016 of 85 days.\nThe cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased $1.4 million in 2018, increased $0.8 million in 2017, and increased $0.6 million in 2016. The increase in each of the years were due to normal appreciation of the existing cash surrender value of the outstanding policies at each respective point in time. Accounts payable increased less than $0.1 million in 2018, increased $1.7 million in 2017, and decreased $0.8 million in 2016. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to payments made near year-end, while the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower payables as the Company's business contracted, and the timing of certain payments near year-end. Accrued compensation increased $2.6 million in 2018 primarily due to significant growth in the company's operations and headcount, and decreased $1.3 million in 2017 primarily due to a reduction in employee headcount. Accrued Compensation was essentially unchanged in 2016 as compared with 2015 as the U.S. bi-weekly payroll was paid on the last business day of the year. Income taxes receivable decreased by $0.5 million in 2018 due to refunds received from the federal government, and increased by $0.6 million in 2017 due to the timing of payments made in 2017. Income taxes receivable were essentially unchanged in 2016 due to the timing and amount of payments made in 2016.\nInvesting activities used $12.6 million, $3.2 million, and $2.6 million of cash in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Cash paid for the acquisition of Soft Company, net of cash acquired was $13.8 million, which includes $12.9 million paid in the 2018 first quarter, and $0.9 million paid in the 2018 second quarter based upon the achievement by Soft Company of certain revenue and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) targets for fiscal 2017. The Company also used cash for additions to property, equipment and capitalized software of $2.2 million in 2018, $2.5 million in 2017, and $2.2 million in 2016. The Company expects the amount to be spent in 2019 on additions to property, equipment and capitalized software to be similar as the amount spent in 2018. The Company has no material commitments for future capital expenditures. The Company received approximately $1.8 million of proceeds from the sale of its corporate administrative building in the first quarter of 2018. As the carrying value of the building was $1.6 million, the Company recorded a gain of $0.1 million after applicable fees. In addition, the Company received a total of $2.1 million of proceeds from life insurance policies on former executives in the 2018 first and fourth quarters, and paid premiums totaling $0.7 million for life insurance policies in the 2018 period. Net cash received from the Company's deferred compensation plans was $0.2 million in the 2018 period as compared with net payments of less than $0.1 million in the 2017 period.\nFinancing activities provided (used) $14.6 million, $(5.5) million, and $(0.9) million of cash in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Net cash paid under the Company revolving credit agreement was $0.8 million in 2018 and $0.3 in 2017. The Company borrowed $29.3 million against the cash surrender value of its life insurance policies, primarily to return capital to shareholders through the Dutch Auction\u201d tender offer, fund the acquisition of Soft Company, and for general working capital purposes. Payments made to taxing authorities that represent the value of shares withheld for taxes in employee equity-based compensation transactions totaled $0.3 million in both the 2018 and 2017 periods. Cash overdrafts relate to the amount of outstanding checks at a point in time, and netted to $(0.5) million and $0.4 million in the 2018 and 2017 periods, respectively. The Company also used $14.9 million to purchase 1,767,000 shares for treasury under its buyback program in the 2018 period, including 1,530,990 shares purchased under the Dutch Auction\u201d tender offer in the 2018 second quarter. The Company also used $6.2 million to purchase 1.2 million shares for treasury under its buyback program in the 2017 period, and $1.2 million to purchase 0.3 million shares in 2016. As of December 31, 2018, $7.7 million was available under the Company's authorization to purchase shares in future periods. The Company recorded $1.8 million, $0.7 million, and $0.3 million during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, from the proceeds from stock option exercises and excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation transactions. These amounts were lower in 2017 and 2016 as compared with 2018 primarily due to a lower average stock price in 2017 and 2016 which led to fewer stock option exercises, and lower tax benefits from equity-based compensation activity.\nThe Company paid dividends totaling $2.9 million in 2016. No dividends were paid in 2018 or 2017 as the Company suspended the payment of its dividend in the 2016 fourth quarter.\nIn December 2017, the Company entered into a new credit and security agreement (the Credit and Security Agreement\u201d) with its bank, which provides for a three-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $45.0 million, including a sublimit of $10.0 million for letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swing line loans. In connection with execution of the credit and security agreement, the Company concurrently repaid in full and terminated the credit agreement dated October 30, 2015.\nThe Credit and Security Agreement expires in December 2020, and has interest rates ranging from 150 to 200 basis points over LIBOR or the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal fund effective rate plus 50 basis points, and (iii) adjusted LIBOR plus 100 basis points plus a spread ranging from 50 to 100 basis points based on the amounts outstanding under the Credit and Security Agreement. The Company can borrow under the agreement with either rate at its discretion.\nThere was $3.6 million, $4.4 million, and $4.7 million outstanding under the Company's lines of credit at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The Company borrows or repays its debt as needed based upon its working capital obligations, including the timing of the U.S. bi-weekly payroll.\nThe maximum amount outstanding under its credit agreements in 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $12.8 million, $6.0 million, and $4.7 million, respectively. The average amounts outstanding during 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $4.1 million, $2.2 million, and $1.9 million, respectively, and carried weighted-average interest rates of 3.4%, 3.0%, and 2.9%, respectively. Total commitment fees incurred in 2018 totaled $0.3 million and approximately $0.1 million in 2017 and 2016, while interest paid in 2018 totaled $0.2 million and less than $0.1 million in 2017 and 2016.\nUnder the Credit and Security Agreement, the Company is required to meet certain financial covenants in order to maintain borrowings under its revolving credit line, pay dividends, and make acquisitions. The covenants are measured quarterly, and at December 31, 2018, included a fixed charge coverage ratio, which must be less than 1.10 to 1.00, consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted for equity-based compensation and severance expense, must be no less than $5.0 million for the trailing twelve months, and capital expenditures for property, plant, equipment, and capitalized software must be no more than $5.0 million in any annual period. The fixed charge coverage ratio is only tested if availability on a measurement date is less than $5.625 million. Actual borrowings by CTG under the Credit and Security Agreement are subject to a borrowing base, which is a formula based on certain eligible receivables and reserves. Total availability as of December 31, 2018 was approximately $30.6 million. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2018 as EBITDA, as defined above, was $8.0 million and capital expenditures for property, equipment and capitalized software were $2.2 million in 2018. The Company was also in compliance with its covenants at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nOf the total cash and cash equivalents reported on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 of $12.4 million, approximately $11.8 million is held by the Company's foreign operations and is considered to be indefinitely reinvested in those operations. The Company has not repatriated any of its cash and cash equivalents from its foreign operations in the past five years, and has no intention of doing so in the foreseeable future as the funds are generally required to meet the working capital needs of its foreign operations.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company believes existing internally available funds, cash potentially generated from future operations, and funds available under the Company's revolving line of credit (subject to collateral limits) totaling $41.1 million, will be sufficient to meet foreseeable working capital and capital expenditure needs, fund stock repurchases, pay a dividend (if any), fund acquisitions, and allow for future internal growth and expansion.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company did not have off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions in 2018, 2017 or 2016 other than guarantees in our European operations which support office leases and performance under government contracts. These guarantees totaled approximately $2.7 million at December 31, 2018.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nThe Company's primary market risk exposure consists of foreign currency exchange risk associated with the Company's European operations. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk\u201d in this report.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\" (\"ASU 2014-09\"). On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the cumulative effect method and applied the requirements of the new standard to only projects that were open as of January 1, 2018. Results for the reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under Topic 605.\nThe Company recorded a net positive adjustment to beginning retained earnings of less than $0.1 million and a corresponding amount to unbilled receivables as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, primarily related to a change in the identification of performance obligations on certain projects. In addition, the Company evaluated its principal and agent conclusions when more than one party is involved in providing goods or service to a customer. The Company recorded approximately $4.6 million, or 1.3% of our 2018 year-to-date revenue on a gross basis, which would have been recorded on a net basis under the Company's historic accounting under Topic 605. The Company reported $358.8 million of revenue in 2018 under Topic 606 and the Company would have reported approximately $354.2 million of revenue under Topic 605.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842),\u201d which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. Topic 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840, Leases. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition approach and will elect the transition method to apply the new lease standard as of the January 1, 2019 adoption date. The Company will continue to report and present comparative periods prior to the adoption date in accordance with ASC 840, including disclosures. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. The Company expects to elect the \u2018package of practical expedients', which permits the Company not to reassess under the new standard prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company also expects to elect the use-of-hindsight practical expedient and it does not expect to elect the practical expedient pertaining to land easements, as it is not applicable. The Company expects a material increase in our assets and liabilities due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. However, the Company does not expect the new lease standard to have a material impact on its consolidated statements of operations and its consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company does not expect the new lease standard to affect its compliance with financial covenants associated with its debt agreement.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715),\u201d which requires that an employer report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations, if one is presented. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments in this Update should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the income statement. The Company has adopted this standard and has applied it retrospectively in the 2018 first quarter. Upon adoption, the Company increased direct costs by approximately $0.1 million and reduced selling, general, and administrative expenses by $0.3 million and increased interest and other expenses by approximately $0.2 million for the 2017 year-to-date period. The Company also reduced selling, general, and administrative expenses by $0.4 million with a corresponding increase to interest and other expenses for the 2016 year-to-date period.\nIn January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)\u201d, which gives entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects resulting from the Act related to items in AOCI that the FASB refers to as having been stranded in AOCI. The Company must adopt this guidance for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance, when adopted, will require new disclosures regarding a company's accounting policy for releasing the tax effects in AOCI and permit the company the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects resulting from the Act that are stranded in AOCI. The Company reclassified approximately $0.3 million to retained earnings due to the adoption of ASU 2018-02 in the 2018 fourth quarter.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company intends to satisfy its contractual obligations from operating cash flows, and, if necessary, from draws on its demand credit line.

During the 2017 third quarter, the National Technical Services Agreement with IBM was extended for two years and now expires on December 31, 2019. As part of the National Technical Services Agreement, the Company also provides its services as a predominant supplier to IBM's Integrated Technology Services and the Systems and Technology Group business units. This agreement accounted for approximately 72% of all of the services provided to IBM by the Company in 2018.

During the 2018 fourth quarter, the Company made the determination to establish a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets in the U.S. given recurring losses in those operations, a cumulative loss from 2016 to 2018, and the uncertainty of income in future years. The deferred tax assets, net, primarily consist of deferred compensation, loss carryforwards, and state taxes. The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period are determined based upon the changes in differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for tax purposes, as measured by the enacted tax rates when these differences are estimated to reverse. The Company has made certain assumptions regarding the timing of the reversal of these assets and liabilities, and whether taxable income in future periods will be sufficient to recognize all or a part of any gross deferred tax asset of the Company.\nThe Company's deferred tax assets and their potential realizability are evaluated each quarter to determine if any changes should be made to the valuation allowance. Any change in the valuation allowance in the future could result in a change in the Company's ETR. A 1% change in the ETR in 2018 would have increased or decreased net income by approximately $22,700, or less than $0.01 per diluted share.\nThere was $3.6 million, $4.4 million, and $4.7 million outstanding under the Company's lines of credit at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The Company borrows or repays its debt as needed based upon its working capital obligations, including the timing of the U.S. bi-weekly payroll.\nThe Company did not have off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions in 2018, 2017 or 2016 other than guarantees in our European operations which support office leases and performance under government contracts. These guarantees totaled approximately $2.7 million at December 31, 2018.\nThe maximum amount outstanding under its credit agreements in 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $12.8 million, $6.0 million, and $4.7 million, respectively. The average amounts outstanding during 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $4.1 million, $2.2 million, and $1.9 million, respectively, and carried weighted-average interest rates of 3.4%, 3.0%, and 2.9%, respectively. Total commitment fees incurred in 2018 totaled $0.3 million and approximately $0.1 million in 2017 and 2016, while interest paid in 2018 totaled $0.2 million and less than $0.1 million in 2017 and 2016.\nThe significant increase in operating income in 2017 was due to the goodwill impairment charges taken in the 2016 first and third quarters totaling $37.3 million. Operating income (loss) was 1.3% of revenue in 2017 as compared with (10.3)% of revenue in 2016. Operating loss from North American operations was reduced by $1.2 million of unexpected costs associated with the Company's self-insurance medical plan, and $0.8 million for severance charges for former executives, or $2.0 million in total, and was $0.1 million in 2017 compared with $35.7 million in 2016.\nReimbursable expenses billed to clients and included in revenue totaled $3.3 million and $4.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in reimbursable expenses year-over-year is primarily due to a reduction in the number of consultants in our healthcare vertical market, as many of those employees travel to client locations to perform services.\nThe Company recorded a net positive adjustment to beginning retained earnings of less than $0.1 million and a corresponding amount to unbilled receivables as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, primarily related to a change in the identification of performance obligations on certain projects. In addition, the Company evaluated its principal and agent conclusions when more than one party is involved in providing goods or service to a customer. The Company recorded approximately $4.6 million, or 1.3% of our 2018 year-to-date revenue on a gross basis, which would have been recorded on a net basis under the Company's historic accounting under Topic 605. The Company reported $358.8 million of revenue in 2018 under Topic 606 and the Company would have reported approximately $354.2 million of revenue under Topic 605.\nThe ETR was high in 2018 primarily due to the Company recording a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets in the U.S. totaling $3.8 million as the Company has recurring pre-tax losses in recent years, cumulative pre-tax losses from 2016 to 2018, and uncertainty as to income in future years. The Company also incurred approximately $0.7 million of tax associated with the GILTI provisions of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and $0.3 million of tax from non-deductible acquisition related costs in our foreign operations. These items, which caused additional tax expense, were offset by a non-taxable life insurance gain, the reversal of the valuation for deferred tax assets in the United Kingdom, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which reduced the US federal corporate tax rate to 21%, and tax benefits for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and Research and Development tax credit (R&D).\nRevenue Recognition\nOn a consolidated basis, IT solutions revenue decreased $3.3 million or 3.5% in 2017 as compared with 2016. Beginning in late 2014, the Company began to see significant reductions in billable resources at a number of its larger healthcare clients which decreased IT solutions revenue in the Company's healthcare vertical market as existing electronic health records (EHR) projects came to an end. This decrease in spending on healthcare IT projects continued throughout 2017 for the clients that we serve. As part of our strategy to shift to non-EHR services, the Company expanded its healthcare IT business development team in 2017 with individuals who have experience selling healthcare IT services such as advisory and technical services, outsourcing, and staff augmentation. However, in 2017, this team as a whole was not successful in reducing our revenue losses in this vertical market and expanding the non-EHR healthcare related services we provide.\nThe ETR was lower than the normal range in 2016 primarily due to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges totaling $37.3 million in the 2016 first and third quarters, and also due to the extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and the Research and Development tax credit (R&D) which were renewed by the U.S. federal government in the 2015 fourth quarter and were effective for all of 2016. These credits totaled approximately $0.6 million.\nFollowing the acquisition of Soft Company, which relies heavily on billable subcontractors, we have revised how we define and calculate headcount in order to report all billable consultants, including both employees and subcontractors. Based on this new approach, the Company's headcount was approximately 4,150 at December 31, 2018, which was a 22.1% increase from approximately 3,400 billable consultants at December 31, 2017. Approximately 92% of this headcount is for technical resources and 8% for support positions.\n C The Company's purchase obligations in 2019, 2020 and 2021 total approximately $2.6 million, including $1.0 million for software maintenance, support and related fees, $0.3 million for telecommunications, $0.6 million for recruiting services, $0.4 million for professional organization memberships, and $0.3 million for computer-based training courses. \nIndustry Trends\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842),\u201d which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. Topic 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840, Leases. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition approach and will elect the transition method to apply the new lease standard as of the January 1, 2019 adoption date. The Company will continue to report and present comparative periods prior to the adoption date in accordance with ASC 840, including disclosures. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. The Company expects to elect the \u2018package of practical expedients', which permits the Company not to reassess under the new standard prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company also expects to elect the use-of-hindsight practical expedient and it does not expect to elect the practical expedient pertaining to land easements, as it is not applicable. The Company expects a material increase in our assets and liabilities due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. However, the Company does not expect the new lease standard to have a material impact on its consolidated statements of operations and its consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company does not expect the new lease standard to affect its compliance with financial covenants associated with its debt agreement.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 18.5% of revenue in 2018 as compared with 17.2% of revenue in 2017. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2018 as compared with 2017 is primarily due to costs incurred by our operating units as the Company continues to make investments in sales, recruiting, and delivery resources in order to focus on the Company's long-term growth. Additionally, SG&A in 2018 includes acquisition-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of Soft Company, totaling $2.0 million, and $0.7 million in severance.\nThe significant increase in revenue in the Company's European operations in 2017 as compared with the corresponding 2016 period was due to an increase in demand for the Company's IT solutions services across a number of the vertical markets we serve and the strength relative to the U.S. dollar of the currencies in Belgium and Luxembourg, partially offset by weakness relative to the U.S. dollar of the currency of the United Kingdom, the countries in which the Company's European subsidiaries operate. In Belgium and Luxembourg, the functional currency is the Euro, while in the United Kingdom the functional currency is the British Pound. In 2017 as compared with 2016, the average value of the Euro increased 2.1%, and the average value of the British Pound decreased 4.9%. A significant portion of the Company's revenue from its European operations is generated in Belgium and Luxembourg. Had there been no change in these exchange rates from 2016 to 2017, total European revenue would have been approximately $1.4 million lower, or $79.7 million as compared with the $81.1 million reported. When considering the year-over-year change in revenue in constant currencies, revenue from our European operations increased 12.9%. Operating income increased by less than $0.1 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 given the change in the exchange rates year-over-year.\nThe Credit and Security Agreement expires in December 2020, and has interest rates ranging from 150 to 200 basis points over LIBOR or the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal fund effective rate plus 50 basis points, and (iii) adjusted LIBOR plus 100 basis points plus a spread ranging from 50 to 100 basis points based on the amounts outstanding under the Credit and Security Agreement. The Company can borrow under the agreement with either rate at its discretion.\nIn December 2017, the Company entered into a new credit and security agreement (the Credit and Security Agreement\u201d) with its bank, which provides for a three-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $45.0 million, including a sublimit of $10.0 million for letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swing line loans. In connection with execution of the credit and security agreement, the Company concurrently repaid in full and terminated the credit agreement dated October 30, 2015.\nOperating income was 0.6% of revenue in 2018 as compared with 1.4% of revenue in 2017. The operating loss from the North American operations was $2.4 million in 2018 compared with $0.1 million in 2017. The 2018 loss was impacted by investments in business development, recruiting, and marketing of nearly $3.5 million, some of which have yet to generate revenue and profits. Additionally, the Company recorded $2.0 million in acquisition related costs, and $0.7 million in severance. Operating income in 2017 was reduced by a total of $2.0 million from unusually high utilization of the Company's self-insured medical plan, and severance.\nThe cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased $1.4 million in 2018, increased $0.8 million in 2017, and increased $0.6 million in 2016. The increase in each of the years were due to normal appreciation of the existing cash surrender value of the outstanding policies at each respective point in time. Accounts payable increased less than $0.1 million in 2018, increased $1.7 million in 2017, and decreased $0.8 million in 2016. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to payments made near year-end, while the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower payables as the Company's business contracted, and the timing of certain payments near year-end. Accrued compensation increased $2.6 million in 2018 primarily due to significant growth in the company's operations and headcount, and decreased $1.3 million in 2017 primarily due to a reduction in employee headcount. Accrued Compensation was essentially unchanged in 2016 as compared with 2015 as the U.S. bi-weekly payroll was paid on the last business day of the year. Income taxes receivable decreased by $0.5 million in 2018 due to refunds received from the federal government, and increased by $0.6 million in 2017 due to the timing of payments made in 2017. Income taxes receivable were essentially unchanged in 2016 due to the timing and amount of payments made in 2016.\nThe ETR was high in 2017 primarily due to the effects of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act which resulted in the Company reducing its U.S. deferred tax assets by $1.7 million, and the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\u201d which required the Company to record additional tax expense of $0.3 million for shortfalls that would previously have been recorded to capital in excess of par value on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. This additional tax expense was partially offset by tax benefits for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and Research and Development tax credit (R&D).\nThe Company recorded revenue in 2018 and 2017 as follows:\n D The Company is committed for deferred compensation benefits in the U.S. under two plans. The Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan (ESBP) provides certain former key executives with deferred compensation benefits. The ESBP was amended as of November 30, 1994 to freeze benefits for participants at that time. At December 31, 2018, 15 individuals were receiving benefits under this plan. The ESBP is deemed to be unfunded as the Company has not specifically identified Company assets to be used to discharge the deferred compensation benefit liabilities. \nThe ETR was higher than the normal range in 2017 primarily due to the effects of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act which resulted in the Company reducing its U.S. deferred tax assets by $1.7 million and the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\u201d which required the Company to record approximately $0.3 million in 2017 of additional tax expense for shortfalls that would previously have been recorded to capital in excess of par value on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. This additional tax expense was partially offset by tax benefits for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and Research and Development tax credit (R&D).\n B Operating lease obligations relate to the rental of office space, office equipment, and automobiles leased in the Company's European operations. Total rental expense under operating leases in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $6.6 million, $5.9 million, and $5.7 million, respectively. \n G The Company has other long-term liabilities including payments for a postretirement benefit plan for several retired employees and their spouses, totaling fewer than 10 participants. \nOther Estimates\n\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715),\u201d which requires that an employer report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations, if one is presented. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments in this Update should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the income statement. The Company has adopted this standard and has applied it retrospectively in the 2018 first quarter. Upon adoption, the Company increased direct costs by approximately $0.1 million and reduced selling, general, and administrative expenses by $0.3 million and increased interest and other expenses by approximately $0.2 million for the 2017 year-to-date period. The Company also reduced selling, general, and administrative expenses by $0.4 million with a corresponding increase to interest and other expenses for the 2016 year-to-date period.\nThe Company's primary market risk exposure consists of foreign currency exchange risk associated with the Company's European operations. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk\u201d in this report.\n F The Company maintains a fully funded pension plan for its Belgium employees. The Company will continue to make additional contributions to fund the plan in future years. \nDirect costs, defined as costs for billable staff including billable out-of-pocket expenses, were 80.9% and 81.4% of consolidated revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Direct costs in 2018 were impacted by higher fringe benefit costs than planned. In the 2017 third quarter, the Company recorded a significant increase in fringe benefit costs primarily consisting of medical expense. The increase in medical expense, which totaled approximately $1.0 million in direct costs, was due to much higher utilization of the Company's self-insured medical plan during the year. The Company also recorded $0.4 million of severance charges in the 2017 second quarter. When considering these items, direct costs as a percentage of revenue in 2018 were comparable with 2017.\n\nThe revenue decrease in North America in 2017 as compared with 2016 was primarily due to a significant decrease in demand for the Company's IT staffing business, primarily in our technology service provider vertical market, and a decrease in demand for our IT solutions services business, primarily in our healthcare vertical market. The revenue increase in Europe is primarily due to strong demand for the Company's services in the European markets we serve.\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $(0.3) million, $9.2 million, and $2.4 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. In 2018, net loss was $(2.8) million, while other non-cash adjustments, primarily consisting of depreciation expense, equity-based compensation, deferred income taxes, deferred compensation, and non-taxable life insurance gain totaled $6.3 million. In 2017 and 2016, net income (loss) was $0.8 million and $(34.6) million, respectively, while the corresponding non-cash adjustments netted to $4.5 million and $40.3 million, respectively.\nNet loss for 2018 was (0.8)% of revenue or $(0.20) per diluted share, compared with net income of 0.3% of revenue or $0.05 per diluted share in 2017. Diluted earnings per share were calculated using 13.8 million weighted-average equivalent shares outstanding in 2018 and 15.3 million in 2017. The decrease in shares year-over-year is due to the Company's Dutch auction tender offer where the Company repurchased approximately 10% of its outstanding shares in April 2018.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised good or service is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. For time-and-material contracts, revenue is recognized as hours are incurred and costs are expended. For contracts with progress billing schedules, primarily monthly, revenue is recognized as services are rendered to the customer. Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognized over time using an input-based approach. Over time revenue recognition best portrays the Company's performance in transferring control of the goods or services to the customer. On most fixed price contracts, revenue recognition is supported through contractual clauses that require the customer to pay for work performed to date, including cost plus a reasonable profit margin, for goods or services that have no alternative use to the Company. On certain contracts, revenue recognition is supported through contractual clauses that indicate the customer controls the asset, or work in process, as the Company creates or enhances the asset. On a given project, actual salary and indirect labor costs incurred are measured and compared with the total estimate of costs of such items at the completion of the project. Revenue is recognized based upon the percentage-of-completion calculation of total incurred costs to total estimated costs. The Company infrequently works on fixed-price projects that include significant amounts of material or other non-labor related costs that could distort the percent complete within a percentage-of-completion calculation. The Company's estimate of the total labor costs it expects to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our experience on similar projects, and includes management judgments and estimates that affect the amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts in any accounting period. Losses on fixed-price projects are recorded when identified.\n\nSDI was the Company's second largest client and accounted for $34.2 million or 11.4% and $34.5 million or 10.6% of the Company's consolidated revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively. SDI acts as a vendor manager for Lenovo, and all of the Company's revenue generated through SDI relates to CTG employees working at Lenovo. The Company's accounts receivable from SDI at December 31,2017 and 2016 totaled $4.7 million and $5.6 million, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOn a consolidated basis, IT solutions revenue increased $21.7 million or 23.7% in 2018 as compared with 2017. 2018 The increase is primarily due to an increase in IT solutions services in Europe and the addition of Soft Company, which was acquired on February 15, 2018. Soft Company primarily specializes in providing IT services to finance, insurance, telecom, and media services companies. The increase was also due in part to our strategy to shift to non-electronic health records (EHR) services in our healthcare vertical market. The Company expanded its healthcare IT business development team in 2018 with individuals who have experience selling healthcare IT services such as advisory and technical services, outsourcing, and staff augmentation. This team was successful in driving revenue growth in this vertical market and expanding the non-EHR healthcare related services we provide.\nDirect costs, defined as costs for billable staff including billable out-of-pocket expenses, were 81.4% and 81.8% of consolidated revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In the 2017 third quarter, the Company recorded a significant increase in fringe benefit costs primarily consisting of medical expense. The increase in medical expense, which totaled approximately $1.0 million in direct costs, was due to much higher utilization of the Company's self-insured medical plan during the year. The Company also recorded $0.4 million of severance charges in the 2017 second quarter. In the 2016 second quarter, the Company's European operations recorded a payroll tax credit totaling approximately $0.7 million which reduced direct costs in 2016. The credited amounts returned certain costs incurred from 2011 to 2014, and the Company does not anticipate a significant credit in the future. When considering these items, direct costs as a percentage of revenue in 2017 decreased as compared with 2016. This decrease was in part due to the significant reduction in IT staffing revenue. These services are provided to the Company's largest IT staffing clients, which have much higher direct costs as a percentage of revenue as compared with the Company's IT solutions clients.\nSDI was the Company's second largest client and accounted for $27.6 million or 7.7% and $34.2 million or 11.4% of the Company's consolidated revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. SDI acts as a vendor manager for Lenovo, and all of the Company's revenue generated through SDI relates to CTG employees working at Lenovo. The Company's accounts receivable from SDI at December 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled $3.6 million and $4.7 million, respectively.\nThe Company's revenue from contracts accounted for under time-and-material, progress billing, and percentage-of-completion methods as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is as follows:\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company's management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company's significant accounting policies are included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by the Company's management in their application, have a significant impact on the\nContractual Obligations\nOf the total cash and cash equivalents reported on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 of $12.4 million, approximately $11.8 million is held by the Company's foreign operations and is considered to be indefinitely reinvested in those operations. The Company has not repatriated any of its cash and cash equivalents from its foreign operations in the past five years, and has no intention of doing so in the foreseeable future as the funds are generally required to meet the working capital needs of its foreign operations.\nThe Company promotes a majority of its services through five vertical market focus areas: technology service providers, manufacturing, healthcare (which includes services provided to healthcare providers, health insurers (payers), and life sciences companies), financial services, and energy. The remainder of CTG's revenue is derived from general markets.\n\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company believes existing internally available funds, cash potentially generated from future operations, and funds available under the Company's revolving line of credit (subject to collateral limits) totaling $41.1 million, will be sufficient to meet foreseeable working capital and capital expenditure needs, fund stock repurchases, pay a dividend (if any), fund acquisitions, and allow for future internal growth and expansion.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had deferred tax assets recorded resulting from net operating losses in previous years totaling approximately $1.0 million. The Company has analyzed each jurisdiction's tax position, including forecasting potential taxable income in future periods and the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards as applicable, and determined that it is unclear whether all of these deferred tax assets will be realized at any point in the future. Accordingly, at December 31, 2018, the Company had offset a portion of these assets with a valuation allowance totaling approximately $0.3 million, resulting in a net deferred tax asset from net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $0.7 million.\nCompany's consolidated financial statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company's financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company's critical accounting policy is related to the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes.\n A On December 21, 2017, the Company entered into the Credit and Security Agreement which provides for a three-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $45.0 million, including a sublimit of $10.0 million for letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swing line loans. The Company uses this Credit and Security Agreement to fund its working capital obligations as needed, primarily funding the U.S. bi-weekly payroll. A total of $3.6 million in borrowings was outstanding under the Credit and Security Agreement as of December 31, 2018. \nOperating income from our European operations was $4.0 million in 2017 compared with $2.4 million in 2016. The increase in operating income in 2017 compared with 2016 is primarily due to an increase in revenue due to strong demand for the Company's services in the European markets we serve. The 2016 results in Europe were reduced by a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $1.7 million, offset by a payroll tax credit of $0.7 million recorded in the 2016 second quarter.\nAlso on a consolidated basis, IT and other staffing revenue decreased $20.3 million or 8.8% during 2017 as compared with 2016. The IT staffing decrease was primarily due to a decrease in demand from a number of the Company's largest staffing clients. Additionally, there was a significant reduction in both requirements and billable rates for certain of the employees provided to our largest staffing client which began to impact the Company in the 2016 fourth quarter.\nDuring the 2016 first quarter, the Company determined that a goodwill impairment indicator existed which required an interim impairment analysis. As a result of the analysis, the Company determined the implied fair value of its goodwill balance was below the carrying value. Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $21.5 million to reduce the value of its goodwill balance to the implied fair value. Additionally, during the 2016 third quarter, the Company determined that another goodwill impairment indicator existed which required a second interim impairment analysis. As a result of the analysis, the Company determined the implied fair value of its goodwill balance was again below the carrying value. Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $15.8 million to reduce the value of its goodwill balance to the implied fair value, which reduced the Company's goodwill balance to $0.0.\nThe Company recorded revenue in 2017 and 2016 as follows:\n2018 as compared with 2017\nItem 7.\nThe Company continues to assess the potential impact, if any, that the United Kingdom's proposed exit from the European Union will have on the Company's operations. As the total revenue generated by our British subsidiary is immaterial when compared with the Company's total consolidated revenue, we do not expect the impact of the pending exit to have a material impact on the Company's operations.\nForward-Looking Statements\nResults of Operations\nThe table below sets forth percentage information calculated as a percentage of consolidated revenue as reported on the Company's consolidated statements of operations as included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this report.\nThe Company paid dividends totaling $2.9 million in 2016. No dividends were paid in 2018 or 2017 as the Company suspended the payment of its dividend in the 2016 fourth quarter.\nThe Company's headcount was approximately 3,200 employees at December 31, 2017, which was a 7% decrease from approximately 3,450 employees at December 31, 2016. Approximately 90% of this headcount was for technical resources and 10% for support positions.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nAccounts receivable balances increased $8.7 million in 2018 as compared with 2017, decreased $5.2 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, and increased $0.7 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. The increase in the accounts receivable balance in 2018 resulted from an increase in revenue of 24.8% in the 2018 fourth quarter as compared with the 2017 fourth quarter. Despite the increase in 2018 fourth quarter revenue, the Company experienced a decrease in days sales outstanding (DSO) due an acceleration of cash collection from several customers. DSO is calculated by dividing accounts receivable obtained from the consolidated balance sheet by average daily revenue for the fourth quarter of the respective year. DSO was 82 days at December 31, 2018 as compared with DSO at December 31, 2017 of 86 days. DSO was 86 days at December 31, 2017 as compared with DSO at December 31, 2016 of 85 days.\nThe Company continues to assess the potential impact, if any, that the United Kingdom's proposed exit from the European Union will have on the Company's operations. As the total revenue generated by our British subsidiary is immaterial when compared with the Company's total consolidated revenue, we do not expect the impact of the pending exit to have a material impact on the Company's operations.\nThe Company primarily operates in one industry segment, providing IT services to its clients. These services include IT solutions and IT and other staffing. With IT solutions services, we generally take responsibility for the deliverables on a project and the services may include high-end consulting. When providing IT and other staffing services, we typically supply personnel to our clients who then, in turn, take their direction from the client's managers. The Company at times provides administrative or warehouse employees to clients to supplement the IT staffing resources we place at those clients.\nWe expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from IBM and SDI in future years; however a significant decline or the loss of the revenue from these clients would have a significant negative effect on our operating results. No other client accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenue in 2018 or 2017.\nIT solutions and IT and other staffing revenue as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is as follows:\n E The Company retained a contributory defined-benefit plan for its previous employees located in the Netherlands when the Company disposed of its subsidiary, CTG Nederland B.V. This plan was curtailed on January 1, 2003 for additional contributions. The Company does not anticipate making additional contributions to fund the plan in future years. \n\nIn January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)\u201d, which gives entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects resulting from the Act related to items in AOCI that the FASB refers to as having been stranded in AOCI. The Company must adopt this guidance for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance, when adopted, will require new disclosures regarding a company's accounting policy for releasing the tax effects in AOCI and permit the company the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects resulting from the Act that are stranded in AOCI. The Company reclassified approximately $0.3 million to retained earnings due to the adoption of ASU 2018-02 in the 2018 fourth quarter.\n\nThe Company has also made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of its assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare the consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, the FASB, and other regulatory authorities. Such estimates primarily relate to the valuation of stock options for recording equity-based compensation expense, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, investment valuation, discount rates associated with pension plans, incurred but not reported healthcare claims, legal matters, and estimates of progress toward completion and direct profit or loss on contracts, as applicable. As future events and their effect on the Company's operating results cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from these estimates. Changes in the economic climates in which the Company operates may affect these estimates and will be reflected in the Company's financial statements in the event they occur.\nThe market demand for the Company's services is heavily dependent on IT spending by major corporations, organizations and government entities in the markets and regions that we serve. The pace of technology advances and changes in business requirements and practices of our clients all have a significant impact on the demand for the services that we provide. Competition for new engagements and pricing pressure has been strong. Throughout 2017 and 2016, many of our healthcare clients did not begin new projects when existing projects ended due to their capital constraints. The demand for the Company's IT solutions business, primarily in our healthcare vertical market in North America improved in 2018 as spending increased along with the improving economy. Additionally, the demand for our IT staffing and other services from certain of our large staffing clients increased during 2018.\nThe significant increase in revenue in the Company's European operations in 2018 as compared with the corresponding 2017 period was due to an increase in demand for the Company's IT solutions services across a number of the vertical markets we serve, and the strength relative to the U.S. dollar of the currencies in Belgium, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, the countries in which the Company's European subsidiaries operate. In Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, the functional currency is the Euro, while in the United Kingdom the functional currency is the British Pound. In 2018 as compared with 2017, the average value of the Euro increased 4.5%, and the average value of the British Pound increased 3.6%. A significant portion of the Company's revenue from its European operations is generated in Belgium and Luxembourg. Had there been no change in these exchange rates from 2017 to 2018, total European revenue would have been approximately $4.9 million lower, or $121.2 million as compared with the $126.1 million reported. When considering the year-over-year change in revenue in constant currencies, revenue from our European operations increased 49%. Operating income increased by $0.3 million in 2018 as compared with 2017 given the change in the exchange rates year-over-year.\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCTG's revenue by vertical market as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is as follows:\nOther income (expense) was 0.1% of revenue in 2017 and (0.1)% of revenue in 2016. In 2017, the Company recorded a non-taxable life insurance gain of approximately $0.4 million as one of its former executives passed away in the 2017 fourth quarter.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n H The Company has a contingent consideration liability related to an earn-out provision of which a portion will be payable in each period subject to the achievement by Soft Company of certain revenue and EBIT targets for fiscal 2018 and 2019. The Company expects to pay approximately $1.1 million and $0.4 million for the achievement of these targets for fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively. \nOther income (expense) was 0.1% of revenue in 2018 and 0.0% of revenue in 2017. In 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded a non-taxable life insurance gain of approximately $0.8 and $0.4 million, respectively, as one of its former executives passed away in each year.\nNet income for 2017 was 0.3% of revenue or $0.05 per diluted share, compared with net loss of (10.7)% of revenue or $(2.22) per diluted share in 2016. Diluted earnings per share were calculated using 15.3 million weighted-average equivalent shares outstanding in 2017 and 15.6 million in 2016. The decrease in shares year-over-year is due to the Company's stock repurchase program. The Company purchased approximately 1.2 million shares of its stock for treasury during 2017.\nThis annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements made by the management of Computer Task Group, Incorporated (CTG, the Company or the Registrant) that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of the date of this report. The Company assumes no obligation to update these statements based on information from and after the date of this report. Generally, forward looking statements include words or phrases such as anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d plans,\u201d projects,\u201d could,\u201d may,\u201d might,\u201d should,\u201d will\u201d and words and phrases of similar impact. The forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding future operations, industry trends or conditions and the business environment, and statements regarding future levels of or trends in business strategy and expectations, new business opportunities, cost control initiatives, business wins, market demand, revenue, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and financing. The forward-looking statements are made pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Numerous factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including the following: (i) the availability to CTG of qualified professional staff, (ii) domestic and foreign industry competition for clients and talent, including technical, sales and management personnel, (iii) increased bargaining power of large clients, (iv) the Company's ability to protect confidential client data, (v) the partial or complete loss of the revenue the Company generates from International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and SDI International (SDI), (vi) the uncertainty of clients' implementations of cost reduction projects, (vii) the effect of healthcare reform and initiatives, (viii) the mix of work between staffing and solutions, (ix) currency exchange risks, (x) risks associated with operating in foreign jurisdictions, (xi) renegotiations, nullification, or breaches of contracts with clients, vendors, subcontractors or other parties, (xii) the impact of current and future laws and government regulation, as well as repeal or modification of such, affecting the information technology (IT) solutions and staffing industry, taxes and the Company's operations in particular, (xiii) industry and economic conditions, including fluctuations in demand for IT services, (xiv) consolidation among the Company's competitors or clients, (xv) the need to supplement or change our IT services in response to new offerings in the industry or changes in client requirements for IT products and solutions, (xvi) the risks associated with acquisitions,\nThe IT services industry is extremely competitive and characterized by continuous changes in client requirements and improvements in technologies. Our competition varies significantly by geographic region, as well as by the type of service provided. Many of our competitors are larger than CTG, and have greater financial, technical, sales, and marketing resources. In addition, the Company frequently competes with a client's own internal IT staff. Our industry is being impacted by the growing use of lower-cost offshore delivery capabilities (primarily India and other parts of Asia). There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully with existing or future competitors or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n</td> </tr>\nFinancing activities provided (used) $14.6 million, $(5.5) million, and $(0.9) million of cash in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Net cash paid under the Company revolving credit agreement was $0.8 million in 2018 and $0.3 in 2017. The Company borrowed $29.3 million against the cash surrender value of its life insurance policies, primarily to return capital to shareholders through the Dutch Auction\u201d tender offer, fund the acquisition of Soft Company, and for general working capital purposes. Payments made to taxing authorities that represent the value of shares withheld for taxes in employee equity-based compensation transactions totaled $0.3 million in both the 2018 and 2017 periods. Cash overdrafts relate to the amount of outstanding checks at a point in time, and netted to $(0.5) million and $0.4 million in the 2018 and 2017 periods, respectively. The Company also used $14.9 million to purchase 1,767,000 shares for treasury under its buyback program in the 2018 period, including 1,530,990 shares purchased under the Dutch Auction\u201d tender offer in the 2018 second quarter. The Company also used $6.2 million to purchase 1.2 million shares for treasury under its buyback program in the 2017 period, and $1.2 million to purchase 0.3 million shares in 2016. As of December 31, 2018, $7.7 million was available under the Company's authorization to purchase shares in future periods. The Company recorded $1.8 million, $0.7 million, and $0.3 million during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, from the proceeds from stock option exercises and excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation transactions. These amounts were lower in 2017 and 2016 as compared with 2018 primarily due to a lower average stock price in 2017 and 2016 which led to fewer stock option exercises, and lower tax benefits from equity-based compensation activity.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 17.3% of revenue in 2017 as compared with 17.0% of revenue in 2016. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2017 as compared with 2016 is primarily due to costs incurred by our operating units as the Company continues to make investments in sales, recruiting and\nUnder the Credit and Security Agreement, the Company is required to meet certain financial covenants in order to maintain borrowings under its revolving credit line, pay dividends, and make acquisitions. The covenants are measured quarterly, and at December 31, 2018, included a fixed charge coverage ratio, which must be less than 1.10 to 1.00, consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted for equity-based compensation and severance expense, must be no less than $5.0 million for the trailing twelve months, and capital expenditures for property, plant, equipment, and capitalized software must be no more than $5.0 million in any annual period. The fixed charge coverage ratio is only tested if availability on a measurement date is less than $5.625 million. Actual borrowings by CTG under the Credit and Security Agreement are subject to a borrowing base, which is a formula based on certain eligible receivables and reserves. Total availability as of December 31, 2018 was approximately $30.6 million. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2018 as EBITDA, as defined above, was $8.0 million and capital expenditures for property, equipment and capitalized software were $2.2 million in 2018. The Company was also in compliance with its covenants at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\n(xvii) the ability to integrate Soft Company and Tech-IT, (xviii) actions of activist shareholders, and (xix) the risks described in Item 1A of this annual report on Form 10-K and from time to time in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nIncome Taxes-Valuation Allowances on Deferred Tax Assets\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was CTG's largest client and accounted for $76.4 million or 25.4% and $98.4 million or 30.3% of the Company's consolidated revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the 2017 third quarter, the National Technical Services Agreement with IBM was extended for two years and now expires on December 31, 2019. As part of the National Technical Services Agreement, the Company also provides its services as a predominant supplier to IBM's Integrated Technology Services and the Systems and Technology Group business units. This agreement accounted for approximately 85% of all of the services provided to IBM by the Company in 2017. As previously mentioned, the reduction in revenue in 2017 as compared with 2016 is due to a reduction in both the number of requirements and bill rates for certain employees provided to this client beginning in the 2016 fourth quarter. The Company's accounts receivable from IBM at December 31, 2017 and 2016 totaled $21.5 million and $28.0 million, respectively.", "item_7_text": "The revenue increase in North America in 2018 as compared with 2017 was primarily due to a significant increase in demand for the Company's IT solutions business, primarily in our healthcare vertical market, and a modest increase in demand for our IT staffing business, primarily in our technology services provider vertical market. The revenue increase in Europe is primarily due to strong demand for the Company's services in the European markets we serve, and the acquisition of Soft Company on February 15, 2018, which has an annual revenue of approximately $30 million.\nAlso on a consolidated basis, IT and other staffing revenue increased $35.9 million or 17.1% during 2018 as compared with 2017. The IT staffing increase was primarily due to the addition of Soft Company in the 2018 first quarter, growth in IT staffing in North America, and in part due to a change in accounting related to the new revenue recognition standard which requires revenue we previously recorded on a net basis to now be recorded on a gross basis for billable subcontractors. The Company recorded $4.6 million, or 1.3% of our 2018 consolidated revenue on a gross basis, which would have been recorded on a net basis under the Company's historic accounting under Topic 605. This accounting change solely related to the IT and other staffing services.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\" (\"ASU 2014-09\"). On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the cumulative effect method and applied the requirements of the new standard to only projects that were open as of January 1, 2018. Results for the reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under Topic 605.\nInvesting activities used $12.6 million, $3.2 million, and $2.6 million of cash in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Cash paid for the acquisition of Soft Company, net of cash acquired was $13.8 million, which includes $12.9 million paid in the 2018 first quarter, and $0.9 million paid in the 2018 second quarter based upon the achievement by Soft Company of certain revenue and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) targets for fiscal 2017. The Company also used cash for additions to property, equipment and capitalized software of $2.2 million in 2018, $2.5 million in 2017, and $2.2 million in 2016. The Company expects the amount to be spent in 2019 on additions to property, equipment and capitalized software to be similar as the amount spent in 2018. The Company has no material commitments for future capital expenditures. The Company received approximately $1.8 million of proceeds from the sale of its corporate administrative building in the first quarter of 2018. As the carrying value of the building was $1.6 million, the Company recorded a gain of $0.1 million after applicable fees. In addition, the Company received a total of $2.1 million of proceeds from life insurance policies on former executives in the 2018 first and fourth quarters, and paid premiums totaling $0.7 million for life insurance policies in the 2018 period. Net cash received from the Company's deferred compensation plans was $0.2 million in the 2018 period as compared with net payments of less than $0.1 million in the 2017 period.\ndelivery resources in order to focus on the Company's long-term growth, and the loss of operating leverage from a decrease in revenue. Additionally, severance incurred for the resignation of three former executives totaled $0.4 million and $1.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe Company's effective tax rate (ETR) is calculated based upon the full year's operating results and various tax related items. The ETR in 2017 was 80.1%, while the 2016 ETR was (3.3)%.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNo other client accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenue in 2017 or 2016.\nOperating income from our European operations was $5.3 million in 2018 compared with $4.0 million in 2017. The increase in operating income in 2018 compared with 2017 is primarily due to strong demand for the Company's services in the European markets we serve, and the acquisition of Soft Company completed in February 2018.\nThe Company's effective tax rate (ETR) is calculated based upon the full year's operating results and various tax related items. The ETR in 2018 was 224%, while the 2017 ETR was 80.1%.\n2017 as compared with 2016\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was CTG's largest client and accounted for $80.6 million or 22.5% and $76.4 million or 25.4% of the Company's consolidated revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the 2017 third quarter, the National Technical Services Agreement with IBM was extended for two years and now expires on December 31, 2019. As part of the National Technical Services Agreement, the Company also provides its services as a predominant supplier to IBM's Integrated Technology Services and the Systems and Technology Group business units. This agreement accounted for approximately 72% of all of the services provided to IBM by the Company in 2018. The Company's accounts receivable from IBM at December 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled $22.1 million and $21.5 million, respectively.\n\nReimbursable expenses billed to clients and included in revenue totaled $3.2 million and $3.3 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe Company intends to satisfy its contractual obligations from operating cash flows, and, if necessary, from draws on its demand credit line. A summary of the Company's contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 is as follows:\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had a total of approximately $0.8 million of deferred tax assets, and approximately $1.6 million of deferred tax liabilities recorded on its consolidated balance sheet. During the 2018 fourth quarter, the Company made the determination to establish a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets in the U.S. given recurring losses in those operations, a cumulative loss from 2016 to 2018, and the uncertainty of income in future years. The deferred tax assets, net, primarily consist of deferred compensation, loss carryforwards, and state taxes. The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period are determined based upon the changes in differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for tax purposes, as measured by the enacted tax rates when these differences are estimated to reverse. The Company has made certain assumptions regarding the timing of the reversal of these assets and liabilities, and whether taxable income in future periods will be sufficient to recognize all or a part of any gross deferred tax asset of the Company.\nThe Company's deferred tax assets and their potential realizability are evaluated each quarter to determine if any changes should be made to the valuation allowance. Any change in the valuation allowance in the future could result in a change in the Company's ETR. A 1% change in the ETR in 2018 would have increased or decreased net income by approximately $22,700, or less than $0.01 per diluted share.\nThere was $3.6 million, $4.4 million, and $4.7 million outstanding under the Company's lines of credit at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The Company borrows or repays its debt as needed based upon its working capital obligations, including the timing of the U.S. bi-weekly payroll.\nThe Company did not have off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions in 2018, 2017 or 2016 other than guarantees in our European operations which support office leases and performance under government contracts. These guarantees totaled approximately $2.7 million at December 31, 2018.\nThe maximum amount outstanding under its credit agreements in 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $12.8 million, $6.0 million, and $4.7 million, respectively. The average amounts outstanding during 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $4.1 million, $2.2 million, and $1.9 million, respectively, and carried weighted-average interest rates of 3.4%, 3.0%, and 2.9%, respectively. Total commitment fees incurred in 2018 totaled $0.3 million and approximately $0.1 million in 2017 and 2016, while interest paid in 2018 totaled $0.2 million and less than $0.1 million in 2017 and 2016.\nThe significant increase in operating income in 2017 was due to the goodwill impairment charges taken in the 2016 first and third quarters totaling $37.3 million. Operating income (loss) was 1.3% of revenue in 2017 as compared with (10.3)% of revenue in 2016. Operating loss from North American operations was reduced by $1.2 million of unexpected costs associated with the Company's self-insurance medical plan, and $0.8 million for severance charges for former executives, or $2.0 million in total, and was $0.1 million in 2017 compared with $35.7 million in 2016.\nReimbursable expenses billed to clients and included in revenue totaled $3.3 million and $4.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in reimbursable expenses year-over-year is primarily due to a reduction in the number of consultants in our healthcare vertical market, as many of those employees travel to client locations to perform services.\nThe Company recorded a net positive adjustment to beginning retained earnings of less than $0.1 million and a corresponding amount to unbilled receivables as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, primarily related to a change in the identification of performance obligations on certain projects. In addition, the Company evaluated its principal and agent conclusions when more than one party is involved in providing goods or service to a customer. The Company recorded approximately $4.6 million, or 1.3% of our 2018 year-to-date revenue on a gross basis, which would have been recorded on a net basis under the Company's historic accounting under Topic 605. The Company reported $358.8 million of revenue in 2018 under Topic 606 and the Company would have reported approximately $354.2 million of revenue under Topic 605.\nThe ETR was high in 2018 primarily due to the Company recording a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets in the U.S. totaling $3.8 million as the Company has recurring pre-tax losses in recent years, cumulative pre-tax losses from 2016 to 2018, and uncertainty as to income in future years. The Company also incurred approximately $0.7 million of tax associated with the GILTI provisions of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and $0.3 million of tax from non-deductible acquisition related costs in our foreign operations. These items, which caused additional tax expense, were offset by a non-taxable life insurance gain, the reversal of the valuation for deferred tax assets in the United Kingdom, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which reduced the US federal corporate tax rate to 21%, and tax benefits for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and Research and Development tax credit (R&D).\nRevenue Recognition\nOn a consolidated basis, IT solutions revenue decreased $3.3 million or 3.5% in 2017 as compared with 2016. Beginning in late 2014, the Company began to see significant reductions in billable resources at a number of its larger healthcare clients which decreased IT solutions revenue in the Company's healthcare vertical market as existing electronic health records (EHR) projects came to an end. This decrease in spending on healthcare IT projects continued throughout 2017 for the clients that we serve. As part of our strategy to shift to non-EHR services, the Company expanded its healthcare IT business development team in 2017 with individuals who have experience selling healthcare IT services such as advisory and technical services, outsourcing, and staff augmentation. However, in 2017, this team as a whole was not successful in reducing our revenue losses in this vertical market and expanding the non-EHR healthcare related services we provide.\nThe ETR was lower than the normal range in 2016 primarily due to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges totaling $37.3 million in the 2016 first and third quarters, and also due to the extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and the Research and Development tax credit (R&D) which were renewed by the U.S. federal government in the 2015 fourth quarter and were effective for all of 2016. These credits totaled approximately $0.6 million.\nFollowing the acquisition of Soft Company, which relies heavily on billable subcontractors, we have revised how we define and calculate headcount in order to report all billable consultants, including both employees and subcontractors. Based on this new approach, the Company's headcount was approximately 4,150 at December 31, 2018, which was a 22.1% increase from approximately 3,400 billable consultants at December 31, 2017. Approximately 92% of this headcount is for technical resources and 8% for support positions.\n C The Company's purchase obligations in 2019, 2020 and 2021 total approximately $2.6 million, including $1.0 million for software maintenance, support and related fees, $0.3 million for telecommunications, $0.6 million for recruiting services, $0.4 million for professional organization memberships, and $0.3 million for computer-based training courses. \nIndustry Trends\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842),\u201d which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. Topic 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840, Leases. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition approach and will elect the transition method to apply the new lease standard as of the January 1, 2019 adoption date. The Company will continue to report and present comparative periods prior to the adoption date in accordance with ASC 840, including disclosures. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. The Company expects to elect the \u2018package of practical expedients', which permits the Company not to reassess under the new standard prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company also expects to elect the use-of-hindsight practical expedient and it does not expect to elect the practical expedient pertaining to land easements, as it is not applicable. The Company expects a material increase in our assets and liabilities due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. However, the Company does not expect the new lease standard to have a material impact on its consolidated statements of operations and its consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company does not expect the new lease standard to affect its compliance with financial covenants associated with its debt agreement.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 18.5% of revenue in 2018 as compared with 17.2% of revenue in 2017. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2018 as compared with 2017 is primarily due to costs incurred by our operating units as the Company continues to make investments in sales, recruiting, and delivery resources in order to focus on the Company's long-term growth. Additionally, SG&A in 2018 includes acquisition-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of Soft Company, totaling $2.0 million, and $0.7 million in severance.\nThe significant increase in revenue in the Company's European operations in 2017 as compared with the corresponding 2016 period was due to an increase in demand for the Company's IT solutions services across a number of the vertical markets we serve and the strength relative to the U.S. dollar of the currencies in Belgium and Luxembourg, partially offset by weakness relative to the U.S. dollar of the currency of the United Kingdom, the countries in which the Company's European subsidiaries operate. In Belgium and Luxembourg, the functional currency is the Euro, while in the United Kingdom the functional currency is the British Pound. In 2017 as compared with 2016, the average value of the Euro increased 2.1%, and the average value of the British Pound decreased 4.9%. A significant portion of the Company's revenue from its European operations is generated in Belgium and Luxembourg. Had there been no change in these exchange rates from 2016 to 2017, total European revenue would have been approximately $1.4 million lower, or $79.7 million as compared with the $81.1 million reported. When considering the year-over-year change in revenue in constant currencies, revenue from our European operations increased 12.9%. Operating income increased by less than $0.1 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 given the change in the exchange rates year-over-year.\nThe Credit and Security Agreement expires in December 2020, and has interest rates ranging from 150 to 200 basis points over LIBOR or the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal fund effective rate plus 50 basis points, and (iii) adjusted LIBOR plus 100 basis points plus a spread ranging from 50 to 100 basis points based on the amounts outstanding under the Credit and Security Agreement. The Company can borrow under the agreement with either rate at its discretion.\nIn December 2017, the Company entered into a new credit and security agreement (the Credit and Security Agreement\u201d) with its bank, which provides for a three-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $45.0 million, including a sublimit of $10.0 million for letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swing line loans. In connection with execution of the credit and security agreement, the Company concurrently repaid in full and terminated the credit agreement dated October 30, 2015.\nOperating income was 0.6% of revenue in 2018 as compared with 1.4% of revenue in 2017. The operating loss from the North American operations was $2.4 million in 2018 compared with $0.1 million in 2017. The 2018 loss was impacted by investments in business development, recruiting, and marketing of nearly $3.5 million, some of which have yet to generate revenue and profits. Additionally, the Company recorded $2.0 million in acquisition related costs, and $0.7 million in severance. Operating income in 2017 was reduced by a total of $2.0 million from unusually high utilization of the Company's self-insured medical plan, and severance.\nThe cash surrender value of life insurance policies increased $1.4 million in 2018, increased $0.8 million in 2017, and increased $0.6 million in 2016. The increase in each of the years were due to normal appreciation of the existing cash surrender value of the outstanding policies at each respective point in time. Accounts payable increased less than $0.1 million in 2018, increased $1.7 million in 2017, and decreased $0.8 million in 2016. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to payments made near year-end, while the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower payables as the Company's business contracted, and the timing of certain payments near year-end. Accrued compensation increased $2.6 million in 2018 primarily due to significant growth in the company's operations and headcount, and decreased $1.3 million in 2017 primarily due to a reduction in employee headcount. Accrued Compensation was essentially unchanged in 2016 as compared with 2015 as the U.S. bi-weekly payroll was paid on the last business day of the year. Income taxes receivable decreased by $0.5 million in 2018 due to refunds received from the federal government, and increased by $0.6 million in 2017 due to the timing of payments made in 2017. Income taxes receivable were essentially unchanged in 2016 due to the timing and amount of payments made in 2016.\nThe ETR was high in 2017 primarily due to the effects of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act which resulted in the Company reducing its U.S. deferred tax assets by $1.7 million, and the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\u201d which required the Company to record additional tax expense of $0.3 million for shortfalls that would previously have been recorded to capital in excess of par value on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. This additional tax expense was partially offset by tax benefits for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and Research and Development tax credit (R&D).\nThe Company recorded revenue in 2018 and 2017 as follows:\n D The Company is committed for deferred compensation benefits in the U.S. under two plans. The Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan (ESBP) provides certain former key executives with deferred compensation benefits. The ESBP was amended as of November 30, 1994 to freeze benefits for participants at that time. At December 31, 2018, 15 individuals were receiving benefits under this plan. The ESBP is deemed to be unfunded as the Company has not specifically identified Company assets to be used to discharge the deferred compensation benefit liabilities. \nThe ETR was higher than the normal range in 2017 primarily due to the effects of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act which resulted in the Company reducing its U.S. deferred tax assets by $1.7 million and the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\u201d which required the Company to record approximately $0.3 million in 2017 of additional tax expense for shortfalls that would previously have been recorded to capital in excess of par value on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. This additional tax expense was partially offset by tax benefits for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and Research and Development tax credit (R&D).\n B Operating lease obligations relate to the rental of office space, office equipment, and automobiles leased in the Company's European operations. Total rental expense under operating leases in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $6.6 million, $5.9 million, and $5.7 million, respectively. \n G The Company has other long-term liabilities including payments for a postretirement benefit plan for several retired employees and their spouses, totaling fewer than 10 participants. \nOther Estimates\n\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715),\u201d which requires that an employer report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations, if one is presented. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments in this Update should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the income statement. The Company has adopted this standard and has applied it retrospectively in the 2018 first quarter. Upon adoption, the Company increased direct costs by approximately $0.1 million and reduced selling, general, and administrative expenses by $0.3 million and increased interest and other expenses by approximately $0.2 million for the 2017 year-to-date period. The Company also reduced selling, general, and administrative expenses by $0.4 million with a corresponding increase to interest and other expenses for the 2016 year-to-date period.\nThe Company's primary market risk exposure consists of foreign currency exchange risk associated with the Company's European operations. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk\u201d in this report.\n F The Company maintains a fully funded pension plan for its Belgium employees. The Company will continue to make additional contributions to fund the plan in future years. \nDirect costs, defined as costs for billable staff including billable out-of-pocket expenses, were 80.9% and 81.4% of consolidated revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Direct costs in 2018 were impacted by higher fringe benefit costs than planned. In the 2017 third quarter, the Company recorded a significant increase in fringe benefit costs primarily consisting of medical expense. The increase in medical expense, which totaled approximately $1.0 million in direct costs, was due to much higher utilization of the Company's self-insured medical plan during the year. The Company also recorded $0.4 million of severance charges in the 2017 second quarter. When considering these items, direct costs as a percentage of revenue in 2018 were comparable with 2017.\n\nThe revenue decrease in North America in 2017 as compared with 2016 was primarily due to a significant decrease in demand for the Company's IT staffing business, primarily in our technology service provider vertical market, and a decrease in demand for our IT solutions services business, primarily in our healthcare vertical market. The revenue increase in Europe is primarily due to strong demand for the Company's services in the European markets we serve.\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $(0.3) million, $9.2 million, and $2.4 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. In 2018, net loss was $(2.8) million, while other non-cash adjustments, primarily consisting of depreciation expense, equity-based compensation, deferred income taxes, deferred compensation, and non-taxable life insurance gain totaled $6.3 million. In 2017 and 2016, net income (loss) was $0.8 million and $(34.6) million, respectively, while the corresponding non-cash adjustments netted to $4.5 million and $40.3 million, respectively.\nNet loss for 2018 was (0.8)% of revenue or $(0.20) per diluted share, compared with net income of 0.3% of revenue or $0.05 per diluted share in 2017. Diluted earnings per share were calculated using 13.8 million weighted-average equivalent shares outstanding in 2018 and 15.3 million in 2017. The decrease in shares year-over-year is due to the Company's Dutch auction tender offer where the Company repurchased approximately 10% of its outstanding shares in April 2018.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised good or service is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. For time-and-material contracts, revenue is recognized as hours are incurred and costs are expended. For contracts with progress billing schedules, primarily monthly, revenue is recognized as services are rendered to the customer. Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognized over time using an input-based approach. Over time revenue recognition best portrays the Company's performance in transferring control of the goods or services to the customer. On most fixed price contracts, revenue recognition is supported through contractual clauses that require the customer to pay for work performed to date, including cost plus a reasonable profit margin, for goods or services that have no alternative use to the Company. On certain contracts, revenue recognition is supported through contractual clauses that indicate the customer controls the asset, or work in process, as the Company creates or enhances the asset. On a given project, actual salary and indirect labor costs incurred are measured and compared with the total estimate of costs of such items at the completion of the project. Revenue is recognized based upon the percentage-of-completion calculation of total incurred costs to total estimated costs. The Company infrequently works on fixed-price projects that include significant amounts of material or other non-labor related costs that could distort the percent complete within a percentage-of-completion calculation. The Company's estimate of the total labor costs it expects to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our experience on similar projects, and includes management judgments and estimates that affect the amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts in any accounting period. Losses on fixed-price projects are recorded when identified.\n\nSDI was the Company's second largest client and accounted for $34.2 million or 11.4% and $34.5 million or 10.6% of the Company's consolidated revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively. SDI acts as a vendor manager for Lenovo, and all of the Company's revenue generated through SDI relates to CTG employees working at Lenovo. The Company's accounts receivable from SDI at December 31,2017 and 2016 totaled $4.7 million and $5.6 million, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOn a consolidated basis, IT solutions revenue increased $21.7 million or 23.7% in 2018 as compared with 2017. 2018 The increase is primarily due to an increase in IT solutions services in Europe and the addition of Soft Company, which was acquired on February 15, 2018. Soft Company primarily specializes in providing IT services to finance, insurance, telecom, and media services companies. The increase was also due in part to our strategy to shift to non-electronic health records (EHR) services in our healthcare vertical market. The Company expanded its healthcare IT business development team in 2018 with individuals who have experience selling healthcare IT services such as advisory and technical services, outsourcing, and staff augmentation. This team was successful in driving revenue growth in this vertical market and expanding the non-EHR healthcare related services we provide.\nDirect costs, defined as costs for billable staff including billable out-of-pocket expenses, were 81.4% and 81.8% of consolidated revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In the 2017 third quarter, the Company recorded a significant increase in fringe benefit costs primarily consisting of medical expense. The increase in medical expense, which totaled approximately $1.0 million in direct costs, was due to much higher utilization of the Company's self-insured medical plan during the year. The Company also recorded $0.4 million of severance charges in the 2017 second quarter. In the 2016 second quarter, the Company's European operations recorded a payroll tax credit totaling approximately $0.7 million which reduced direct costs in 2016. The credited amounts returned certain costs incurred from 2011 to 2014, and the Company does not anticipate a significant credit in the future. When considering these items, direct costs as a percentage of revenue in 2017 decreased as compared with 2016. This decrease was in part due to the significant reduction in IT staffing revenue. These services are provided to the Company's largest IT staffing clients, which have much higher direct costs as a percentage of revenue as compared with the Company's IT solutions clients.\nSDI was the Company's second largest client and accounted for $27.6 million or 7.7% and $34.2 million or 11.4% of the Company's consolidated revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. SDI acts as a vendor manager for Lenovo, and all of the Company's revenue generated through SDI relates to CTG employees working at Lenovo. The Company's accounts receivable from SDI at December 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled $3.6 million and $4.7 million, respectively.\nThe Company's revenue from contracts accounted for under time-and-material, progress billing, and percentage-of-completion methods as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is as follows:\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company's management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company's significant accounting policies are included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d These policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by the Company's management in their application, have a significant impact on the\nContractual Obligations\nOf the total cash and cash equivalents reported on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 of $12.4 million, approximately $11.8 million is held by the Company's foreign operations and is considered to be indefinitely reinvested in those operations. The Company has not repatriated any of its cash and cash equivalents from its foreign operations in the past five years, and has no intention of doing so in the foreseeable future as the funds are generally required to meet the working capital needs of its foreign operations.\nThe Company promotes a majority of its services through five vertical market focus areas: technology service providers, manufacturing, healthcare (which includes services provided to healthcare providers, health insurers (payers), and life sciences companies), financial services, and energy. The remainder of CTG's revenue is derived from general markets.\n\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company believes existing internally available funds, cash potentially generated from future operations, and funds available under the Company's revolving line of credit (subject to collateral limits) totaling $41.1 million, will be sufficient to meet foreseeable working capital and capital expenditure needs, fund stock repurchases, pay a dividend (if any), fund acquisitions, and allow for future internal growth and expansion.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had deferred tax assets recorded resulting from net operating losses in previous years totaling approximately $1.0 million. The Company has analyzed each jurisdiction's tax position, including forecasting potential taxable income in future periods and the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards as applicable, and determined that it is unclear whether all of these deferred tax assets will be realized at any point in the future. Accordingly, at December 31, 2018, the Company had offset a portion of these assets with a valuation allowance totaling approximately $0.3 million, resulting in a net deferred tax asset from net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $0.7 million.\nCompany's consolidated financial statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company's financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company's critical accounting policy is related to the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes.\n A On December 21, 2017, the Company entered into the Credit and Security Agreement which provides for a three-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $45.0 million, including a sublimit of $10.0 million for letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swing line loans. The Company uses this Credit and Security Agreement to fund its working capital obligations as needed, primarily funding the U.S. bi-weekly payroll. A total of $3.6 million in borrowings was outstanding under the Credit and Security Agreement as of December 31, 2018. \nOperating income from our European operations was $4.0 million in 2017 compared with $2.4 million in 2016. The increase in operating income in 2017 compared with 2016 is primarily due to an increase in revenue due to strong demand for the Company's services in the European markets we serve. The 2016 results in Europe were reduced by a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $1.7 million, offset by a payroll tax credit of $0.7 million recorded in the 2016 second quarter.\nAlso on a consolidated basis, IT and other staffing revenue decreased $20.3 million or 8.8% during 2017 as compared with 2016. The IT staffing decrease was primarily due to a decrease in demand from a number of the Company's largest staffing clients. Additionally, there was a significant reduction in both requirements and billable rates for certain of the employees provided to our largest staffing client which began to impact the Company in the 2016 fourth quarter.\nDuring the 2016 first quarter, the Company determined that a goodwill impairment indicator existed which required an interim impairment analysis. As a result of the analysis, the Company determined the implied fair value of its goodwill balance was below the carrying value. Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $21.5 million to reduce the value of its goodwill balance to the implied fair value. Additionally, during the 2016 third quarter, the Company determined that another goodwill impairment indicator existed which required a second interim impairment analysis. As a result of the analysis, the Company determined the implied fair value of its goodwill balance was again below the carrying value. Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $15.8 million to reduce the value of its goodwill balance to the implied fair value, which reduced the Company's goodwill balance to $0.0.\nThe Company recorded revenue in 2017 and 2016 as follows:\n2018 as compared with 2017\nItem 7.\nThe Company continues to assess the potential impact, if any, that the United Kingdom's proposed exit from the European Union will have on the Company's operations. As the total revenue generated by our British subsidiary is immaterial when compared with the Company's total consolidated revenue, we do not expect the impact of the pending exit to have a material impact on the Company's operations.\nForward-Looking Statements\nResults of Operations\nThe table below sets forth percentage information calculated as a percentage of consolidated revenue as reported on the Company's consolidated statements of operations as included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this report.\nThe Company paid dividends totaling $2.9 million in 2016. No dividends were paid in 2018 or 2017 as the Company suspended the payment of its dividend in the 2016 fourth quarter.\nThe Company's headcount was approximately 3,200 employees at December 31, 2017, which was a 7% decrease from approximately 3,450 employees at December 31, 2016. Approximately 90% of this headcount was for technical resources and 10% for support positions.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nAccounts receivable balances increased $8.7 million in 2018 as compared with 2017, decreased $5.2 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, and increased $0.7 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. The increase in the accounts receivable balance in 2018 resulted from an increase in revenue of 24.8% in the 2018 fourth quarter as compared with the 2017 fourth quarter. Despite the increase in 2018 fourth quarter revenue, the Company experienced a decrease in days sales outstanding (DSO) due an acceleration of cash collection from several customers. DSO is calculated by dividing accounts receivable obtained from the consolidated balance sheet by average daily revenue for the fourth quarter of the respective year. DSO was 82 days at December 31, 2018 as compared with DSO at December 31, 2017 of 86 days. DSO was 86 days at December 31, 2017 as compared with DSO at December 31, 2016 of 85 days.\nThe Company continues to assess the potential impact, if any, that the United Kingdom's proposed exit from the European Union will have on the Company's operations. As the total revenue generated by our British subsidiary is immaterial when compared with the Company's total consolidated revenue, we do not expect the impact of the pending exit to have a material impact on the Company's operations.\nThe Company primarily operates in one industry segment, providing IT services to its clients. These services include IT solutions and IT and other staffing. With IT solutions services, we generally take responsibility for the deliverables on a project and the services may include high-end consulting. When providing IT and other staffing services, we typically supply personnel to our clients who then, in turn, take their direction from the client's managers. The Company at times provides administrative or warehouse employees to clients to supplement the IT staffing resources we place at those clients.\nWe expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from IBM and SDI in future years; however a significant decline or the loss of the revenue from these clients would have a significant negative effect on our operating results. No other client accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenue in 2018 or 2017.\nIT solutions and IT and other staffing revenue as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is as follows:\n E The Company retained a contributory defined-benefit plan for its previous employees located in the Netherlands when the Company disposed of its subsidiary, CTG Nederland B.V. This plan was curtailed on January 1, 2003 for additional contributions. The Company does not anticipate making additional contributions to fund the plan in future years. \n\nIn January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)\u201d, which gives entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects resulting from the Act related to items in AOCI that the FASB refers to as having been stranded in AOCI. The Company must adopt this guidance for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance, when adopted, will require new disclosures regarding a company's accounting policy for releasing the tax effects in AOCI and permit the company the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects resulting from the Act that are stranded in AOCI. The Company reclassified approximately $0.3 million to retained earnings due to the adoption of ASU 2018-02 in the 2018 fourth quarter.\n\nThe Company has also made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of its assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare the consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, the FASB, and other regulatory authorities. Such estimates primarily relate to the valuation of stock options for recording equity-based compensation expense, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, investment valuation, discount rates associated with pension plans, incurred but not reported healthcare claims, legal matters, and estimates of progress toward completion and direct profit or loss on contracts, as applicable. As future events and their effect on the Company's operating results cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from these estimates. Changes in the economic climates in which the Company operates may affect these estimates and will be reflected in the Company's financial statements in the event they occur.\nThe market demand for the Company's services is heavily dependent on IT spending by major corporations, organizations and government entities in the markets and regions that we serve. The pace of technology advances and changes in business requirements and practices of our clients all have a significant impact on the demand for the services that we provide. Competition for new engagements and pricing pressure has been strong. Throughout 2017 and 2016, many of our healthcare clients did not begin new projects when existing projects ended due to their capital constraints. The demand for the Company's IT solutions business, primarily in our healthcare vertical market in North America improved in 2018 as spending increased along with the improving economy. Additionally, the demand for our IT staffing and other services from certain of our large staffing clients increased during 2018.\nThe significant increase in revenue in the Company's European operations in 2018 as compared with the corresponding 2017 period was due to an increase in demand for the Company's IT solutions services across a number of the vertical markets we serve, and the strength relative to the U.S. dollar of the currencies in Belgium, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, the countries in which the Company's European subsidiaries operate. In Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, the functional currency is the Euro, while in the United Kingdom the functional currency is the British Pound. In 2018 as compared with 2017, the average value of the Euro increased 4.5%, and the average value of the British Pound increased 3.6%. A significant portion of the Company's revenue from its European operations is generated in Belgium and Luxembourg. Had there been no change in these exchange rates from 2017 to 2018, total European revenue would have been approximately $4.9 million lower, or $121.2 million as compared with the $126.1 million reported. When considering the year-over-year change in revenue in constant currencies, revenue from our European operations increased 49%. Operating income increased by $0.3 million in 2018 as compared with 2017 given the change in the exchange rates year-over-year.\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCTG's revenue by vertical market as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is as follows:\nOther income (expense) was 0.1% of revenue in 2017 and (0.1)% of revenue in 2016. In 2017, the Company recorded a non-taxable life insurance gain of approximately $0.4 million as one of its former executives passed away in the 2017 fourth quarter.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n H The Company has a contingent consideration liability related to an earn-out provision of which a portion will be payable in each period subject to the achievement by Soft Company of certain revenue and EBIT targets for fiscal 2018 and 2019. The Company expects to pay approximately $1.1 million and $0.4 million for the achievement of these targets for fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively. \nOther income (expense) was 0.1% of revenue in 2018 and 0.0% of revenue in 2017. In 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded a non-taxable life insurance gain of approximately $0.8 and $0.4 million, respectively, as one of its former executives passed away in each year.\nNet income for 2017 was 0.3% of revenue or $0.05 per diluted share, compared with net loss of (10.7)% of revenue or $(2.22) per diluted share in 2016. Diluted earnings per share were calculated using 15.3 million weighted-average equivalent shares outstanding in 2017 and 15.6 million in 2016. The decrease in shares year-over-year is due to the Company's stock repurchase program. The Company purchased approximately 1.2 million shares of its stock for treasury during 2017.\nThis annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements made by the management of Computer Task Group, Incorporated (CTG, the Company or the Registrant) that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of the date of this report. The Company assumes no obligation to update these statements based on information from and after the date of this report. Generally, forward looking statements include words or phrases such as anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d plans,\u201d projects,\u201d could,\u201d may,\u201d might,\u201d should,\u201d will\u201d and words and phrases of similar impact. The forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding future operations, industry trends or conditions and the business environment, and statements regarding future levels of or trends in business strategy and expectations, new business opportunities, cost control initiatives, business wins, market demand, revenue, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and financing. The forward-looking statements are made pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Numerous factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including the following: (i) the availability to CTG of qualified professional staff, (ii) domestic and foreign industry competition for clients and talent, including technical, sales and management personnel, (iii) increased bargaining power of large clients, (iv) the Company's ability to protect confidential client data, (v) the partial or complete loss of the revenue the Company generates from International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and SDI International (SDI), (vi) the uncertainty of clients' implementations of cost reduction projects, (vii) the effect of healthcare reform and initiatives, (viii) the mix of work between staffing and solutions, (ix) currency exchange risks, (x) risks associated with operating in foreign jurisdictions, (xi) renegotiations, nullification, or breaches of contracts with clients, vendors, subcontractors or other parties, (xii) the impact of current and future laws and government regulation, as well as repeal or modification of such, affecting the information technology (IT) solutions and staffing industry, taxes and the Company's operations in particular, (xiii) industry and economic conditions, including fluctuations in demand for IT services, (xiv) consolidation among the Company's competitors or clients, (xv) the need to supplement or change our IT services in response to new offerings in the industry or changes in client requirements for IT products and solutions, (xvi) the risks associated with acquisitions,\nThe IT services industry is extremely competitive and characterized by continuous changes in client requirements and improvements in technologies. Our competition varies significantly by geographic region, as well as by the type of service provided. Many of our competitors are larger than CTG, and have greater financial, technical, sales, and marketing resources. In addition, the Company frequently competes with a client's own internal IT staff. Our industry is being impacted by the growing use of lower-cost offshore delivery capabilities (primarily India and other parts of Asia). There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully with existing or future competitors or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n</td> </tr>\nFinancing activities provided (used) $14.6 million, $(5.5) million, and $(0.9) million of cash in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Net cash paid under the Company revolving credit agreement was $0.8 million in 2018 and $0.3 in 2017. The Company borrowed $29.3 million against the cash surrender value of its life insurance policies, primarily to return capital to shareholders through the Dutch Auction\u201d tender offer, fund the acquisition of Soft Company, and for general working capital purposes. Payments made to taxing authorities that represent the value of shares withheld for taxes in employee equity-based compensation transactions totaled $0.3 million in both the 2018 and 2017 periods. Cash overdrafts relate to the amount of outstanding checks at a point in time, and netted to $(0.5) million and $0.4 million in the 2018 and 2017 periods, respectively. The Company also used $14.9 million to purchase 1,767,000 shares for treasury under its buyback program in the 2018 period, including 1,530,990 shares purchased under the Dutch Auction\u201d tender offer in the 2018 second quarter. The Company also used $6.2 million to purchase 1.2 million shares for treasury under its buyback program in the 2017 period, and $1.2 million to purchase 0.3 million shares in 2016. As of December 31, 2018, $7.7 million was available under the Company's authorization to purchase shares in future periods. The Company recorded $1.8 million, $0.7 million, and $0.3 million during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, from the proceeds from stock option exercises and excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation transactions. These amounts were lower in 2017 and 2016 as compared with 2018 primarily due to a lower average stock price in 2017 and 2016 which led to fewer stock option exercises, and lower tax benefits from equity-based compensation activity.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 17.3% of revenue in 2017 as compared with 17.0% of revenue in 2016. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2017 as compared with 2016 is primarily due to costs incurred by our operating units as the Company continues to make investments in sales, recruiting and\nUnder the Credit and Security Agreement, the Company is required to meet certain financial covenants in order to maintain borrowings under its revolving credit line, pay dividends, and make acquisitions. The covenants are measured quarterly, and at December 31, 2018, included a fixed charge coverage ratio, which must be less than 1.10 to 1.00, consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted for equity-based compensation and severance expense, must be no less than $5.0 million for the trailing twelve months, and capital expenditures for property, plant, equipment, and capitalized software must be no more than $5.0 million in any annual period. The fixed charge coverage ratio is only tested if availability on a measurement date is less than $5.625 million. Actual borrowings by CTG under the Credit and Security Agreement are subject to a borrowing base, which is a formula based on certain eligible receivables and reserves. Total availability as of December 31, 2018 was approximately $30.6 million. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2018 as EBITDA, as defined above, was $8.0 million and capital expenditures for property, equipment and capitalized software were $2.2 million in 2018. The Company was also in compliance with its covenants at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\n(xvii) the ability to integrate Soft Company and Tech-IT, (xviii) actions of activist shareholders, and (xix) the risks described in Item 1A of this annual report on Form 10-K and from time to time in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nIncome Taxes-Valuation Allowances on Deferred Tax Assets\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was CTG's largest client and accounted for $76.4 million or 25.4% and $98.4 million or 30.3% of the Company's consolidated revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the 2017 third quarter, the National Technical Services Agreement with IBM was extended for two years and now expires on December 31, 2019. As part of the National Technical Services Agreement, the Company also provides its services as a predominant supplier to IBM's Integrated Technology Services and the Systems and Technology Group business units. This agreement accounted for approximately 85% of all of the services provided to IBM by the Company in 2017. As previously mentioned, the reduction in revenue in 2017 as compared with 2016 is due to a reduction in both the number of requirements and bill rates for certain employees provided to this client beginning in the 2016 fourth quarter. The Company's accounts receivable from IBM at December 31, 2017 and 2016 totaled $21.5 million and $28.0 million, respectively.", "item_7_tables": "Table 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

2017, driven by growth in Europe and the acquisition of Soft Company. North America revenue grew 5.7%. \n\n- Net loss was 0.8% of revenue in 2018 compared to net income of 0.3% in 2017. The net loss was due to investments in sales, recruiting, and delivery resources, acquisition costs, and severance charges.\n\n- IBM remained the largest client, accounting for 22.5% of revenue. SDI was the second largest client at 11.4% of revenue. \n\n- The company adopted the new revenue recognition standard (ASC 606) effective January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis. This resulted in an increase of 1.3% in reported 2018 revenue.\n\n- Days sales outstanding improved to 82 days at December 31, 2018 from 86 days at December 31, 2017. \n\n- The effective tax rate was very high in 2018 at 224% primarily due to recording a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the U.S.\n\n- The company amended its credit facility, expanding it to $45 million through December 2020. Covenant requirements were met at December 31, 2018.\n\n- The company repurchased 1.8 million shares in 2018 for $14.9 million, including a \"Dutch Auction\" tender offer. \n\n- The company adopted new lease accounting guidance effective January 1, 2019, which is expected to materially increase assets and liabilities on the balance sheet."}
