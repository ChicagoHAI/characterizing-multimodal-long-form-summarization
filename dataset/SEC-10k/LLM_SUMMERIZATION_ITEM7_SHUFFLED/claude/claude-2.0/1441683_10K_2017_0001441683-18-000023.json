Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those under Risk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe provide a leading low-code software development platform as a service that enables organizations to rapidly develop powerful and unique applications. The applications created on our platform help companies drive digital transformation and competitive differentiation.\nWith our platform, organizations can rapidly and easily design, build and implement powerful, enterprise-grade custom applications through our intuitive, visual interface with little or no coding required. Our customers have used applications built on our low-code platform to launch new business lines, automate vital employee workflows, manage complex trading platforms, accelerate drug development and build global procurement systems. With our platform, decision makers can reimagine their products, services, processes and customer interactions by removing much of the complexity and many of the challenges associated with traditional approaches to software development.\nIn 2016 and 2017, we have generated the majority of our revenue from sales of subscriptions, software and support, which include (1) SaaS subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services, and (2) term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support. To a lesser extent, we also generate revenue from the sale of perpetual software license agreements and associated maintenance and support agreements.\nOur subscription fees are based primarily on the number of users who access and utilize the applications built on our platform. Our customer contract terms vary from one to five years, with an average length of three years, with most providing for payment in advance on an annual, quarterly or monthly basis. Due to the variability of our billing terms and the episodic nature of our customers purchasing additional subscriptions, we do not believe that changes in our deferred revenue in a given period are directly correlated with our revenue growth.\nSince inception, we have invested in our professional services organization to help ensure that customers are able to build and deploy applications on our platform. We have several strategic partnerships, including with Deloitte, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers for them to refer customers to us and then to provide professional services directly to the customers using our platform. We intend to further grow our base of strategic partners to provide broader customer coverage and solution delivery capabilities. In addition, over time we expect professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue to decline as we increasingly rely on strategic partners to help our customers deploy our software. We believe our investment in professional services, including strategic partners building their practices around Appian, will drive increased adoption of our platform.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had 356 customers in a wide variety of industries, of which 285 customers were commercial and 71 customers were government or non-commercial entities. Our customers include financial services, healthcare, government, telecommunications, media, energy, manufacturing and transportation organizations. Generally, our sales force targets its efforts to organizations with over 2,000 employees and $2 billion in annual revenue. As of December 31, 2017, 29% of our commercial customers were Global 2000 organizations and included 44 Fortune 500 companies. Revenue from government agencies represented 15.4%, 26.2% and 32.7% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No single end-customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nOur platform is designed to be natively multi-lingual to facilitate collaboration and address challenges in multi-national organizations. We offer our platform globally. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, 27.0%, 19.5% and 19.9%, respectively, of our total revenue was generated from customers outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2017, we operated in 11 countries. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to grow our international footprint. We are investing in new geographies, including through investment in direct and indirect sales channels, professional services and customer support and implementation partners.\nWe have experienced strong revenue growth, with revenue of $176.7 million, $132.9 million and $111.2 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our subscription revenue was $82.8 million, $60.0 million and $41.5 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWe have invested in developing our platform, expanding our sales and marketing and research and development capabilities, and providing general and administrative resources to support our growth. We intend to continue to invest in our business to take advantage of our market opportunity. As a result, we incurred net losses of $31.0 million, $12.5 million and $7.0 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also had operating cash flows of $(9.1) million, $(7.8) million and $(2.1) million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nRecent Developments\nIn November 2017, we completed a secondary offering pursuant to which stockholders sold an aggregate of 4,370,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $20.25 per share, including 570,000 shares pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional Class A shares. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of our Class A common stock offered in the secondary offering.\nOur Business Model\nOur business model focuses on maximizing the lifetime value of customer relationships, which is a function of the duration of a customer's deployment of Appian as well as the price and number of subscriptions of Appian that a customer purchases. The costs we incur with respect to any customer may exceed revenue from that customer in earlier periods because we generally recognize costs associated with customer acquisition faster than we generate and recognize the associated revenue. We incur significant customer acquisition costs, including expenses associated with hiring new sales representatives, who generally take more than one year to become productive given the length of our sales cycle, and marketing costs, all of which are expensed as incurred. Our customer contract terms vary from one to five years, with an average length of three years, with most providing for payment in advance on an annual, quarterly or monthly basis, and we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the subscription period.\nAt the same time, we believe that the costs we incur to retain customers and drive additional purchases of software are lower than our customer acquisition costs on a relative basis. Over time, we expect a large portion of our customers to renew their subscriptions and purchase additional subscriptions as they continue to build more applications and add more users to our platform. Over the last three completed fiscal years, we had an average subscription renewal rate of 95%. We calculate our subscription renewal rate by dividing (i) the subscription revenue from renewing customers in the current 12-month period that were customers during the entirety of the prior 12-month period, giving effect to price increases but excluding additional subscriptions for additional users, or upsells, by (ii) our subscription revenue from all customers in the corresponding prior 12-month period that were customers during the entirety of such prior 12-month period. For example, to obtain our subscription renewal rate for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2017, we identified the amount of subscription revenue in 2017 from customers that were our customers for all of 2016, and subtracted the amount of upsells to such customers in 2017. We then divided the balance of 2017 subscription revenue from such customers by all subscription revenue generated in 2016 from customers that were customers for the entirety of 2016. With respect to the average for our last three completed fiscal years, we calculated the average of the three applicable 12-month periods. We also expect the proportion of annual revenue from existing customers to grow relative to annual revenue from new customers. We believe this mix shift over time will have a positive impact on our operating margins, as we expect the percentage of revenue spent on sales and marketing to decline.\nWe measure the effectiveness of our business model by comparing the lifetime value of our customer relationships to our customer acquisition costs. We calculate lifetime customer value as (1) average gross margin multiplied by average subscription and maintenance and support revenue from customers for a given month divided by (2) the average percentage of monthly recurring revenue that did not renew in each month for the previous 12 months. We then divide this calculated lifetime customer value by our customer acquisition cost, which is the total sales and marketing expense incurred during the corresponding month. On a rolling twelve month basis, we estimate that for each of 2017, 2016 and 2015 the average lifetime value of a customer has exceeded 7x the associated average cost of acquiring them.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nThe following are several key factors that affect our performance:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Market Adoption of Our Platform. Our ability to grow our customer base and drive market adoption of our platform is affected by the pace at which organizations digitally transform. We expect that our revenue growth will be primarily driven by the pace of adoption and penetration of our platform. We offer a leading custom software development platform and intend to continue to invest to expand our customer base. The degree to which prospective customers\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nrecognize the need for low-code software that enables organizations to digitally transform, and subsequently allocate budget dollars to purchase our software, will drive our ability to acquire new customers and increase sales to existing customers, which, in turn, will affect our future financial performance.\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Growth of Our Customer Base. We believe we have a substantial opportunity to grow our customer base. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription or maintenance and support contract related to a perpetual software license as of the specified measurement date. To the extent we contract with one or more entities under common control, we count those entities as separate customers. We have aggressively invested, and intend to continue to invest, in our sales force in order to drive sales to new customers. In particular, we have recently made, and plan to continue to make, investments to enhance the expertise of our sales and marketing organization within our key industry verticals of financial services, healthcare and government. In addition, we have established relationships with strategic partners who work with organizations undergoing digital transformations. We had a total customer count of 356, 280 and 266 as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which includes customers with active software subscription agreements or with maintenance and support contracts, and our number of customers with active software subscription agreements was 291, 206 and 178 as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, 29% of our commercial customers were Global 2000 organizations and included 44 Fortune 500 companies. Our ability to continue to grow our customer base is dependent, in part, upon our ability to compete within the increasingly competitive markets in which we participate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Further Penetration of Existing Customers. Our sales force seeks to generate additional revenue from existing customers by adding new users to our platform. Many of our customers begin by building a single application and then grow to build dozens of applications on our platform. Generally, the development of new applications on our platform results in the expansion of our user base within an organization and a corresponding increase in revenue to us because we charge subscription fees on a per-user basis for the significant majority of our customer contracts. As a result of this land and expand\u201d strategy, we have generated significant additional revenue from our customer base. Our ability to increase sales to existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including the size of our sales force and professional services teams, customers' level of satisfaction with our platform and professional services, pricing, economic conditions and our customers' overall spending levels.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Mix of Subscription and Professional Services Revenue. We believe our professional services have driven customer success and facilitated the adoption of our platform by customers. During the initial period of deployment by a customer, we generally provide a greater amount of support in building applications and training than later in the deployment, with a typical engagement extending from two to six months. At the same time, many of our customers have historically purchased subscriptions only for a limited set of their total potential end users. As a result of these factors, the proportion of total revenue for a customer associated with professional services is relatively high during the initial deployment period. Over time, as the need for professional services associated with user deployments decreases and the number of end users increases, we expect the mix of total revenue to shift more toward subscription revenue. In addition, we intend to further grow our base of strategic partners to provide broader customer coverage and solution delivery capabilities. These partners perform professional services with respect to any new service contracts they sign. As we expand the network of strategic partners, we expect the proportion of our total revenue from subscriptions to increase over time relative to professional services. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, 51.8%, 52.6% and 47.8% of our revenue, respectively, was derived from sales of subscriptions, software and support, while the remaining 48.2%, 47.4% and 52.2%, respectively, was derived from the sale of professional services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Investments in Growth. We have made and plan to continue to make investments for long-term growth, including investment in our platform and infrastructure to continuously maximize the power and simplicity of the platform to meet the evolving needs of our customers and to take advantage of our market opportunity. We intend to continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing, as we further expand our sales teams, increase our marketing activities and grow our international operations. We expect to use a portion of the proceeds from our IPO to fund these growth strategies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Metrics\nWe monitor the following metrics to help us measure and evaluate the effectiveness of our operations (dollars in thousands):\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription Revenue Retention Rate\n</td> <td>122\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubscription Revenue\nSubscription revenue is a portion of our revenue contained in the subscriptions, software and support revenue line of our consolidated statements of operations, and includes (1) software as a service, or SaaS, subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services, and (2) term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support. As we generally sell our software on a per-user basis, our subscription revenue for any customer is primarily determined by the number of users who access and utilize the applications built on our platform, as well as the price paid. We believe that increasing our subscription revenue is an indicator of the demand for our platform, the pace at which the market for our solutions is growing, the productivity of our sales force and strategic relationships in growing our customer base, and our ability to further penetrate our existing customer base.\nSubscription Revenue Retention Rate\nA key factor to our success is the renewal and expansion of subscription agreements with our existing customers. We calculate this metric over a set of customers who have been with us for at least one full year. To calculate our subscription revenue retention rate for a particular trailing 12-month period, we first establish the recurring subscription revenue for the previous trailing 12-month period. This effectively represents recurring dollars that we should expect in the current trailing 12-month period from the cohort of customers from the previous trailing 12-month period without any expansion or contraction. We subsequently measure the recurring subscription revenue in the current trailing 12-month period from the cohort of customers from the previous trailing 12-month period. Subscription revenue retention rate is then calculated by dividing the aggregate recurring subscription revenue in the current trailing 12-month period by the previous trailing 12-month period. This calculation includes the impact on our revenue from customer non-renewals, pricing changes and growth in the number of users on our platform. Our subscription revenue retention rate can fluctuate from period to period due to large customer contracts in any given period.\nCustomer Cohort Analysis\nWe focus on acquiring new customers and growing our relationships with existing customers over time. The chart below illustrates our history of attracting new customers and expanding our revenue from them over time as they realize the benefits of building applications using our software.\nThe chart reflects annualized subscription revenue for the group of customers that became our customers in each respective cohort year. For instance, the 2014 cohort includes all customers whose contract start date was between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014. Annualized subscription revenue is the total amount of daily subscription revenue for that applicable customer cohort in January of the following year multiplied by 365. We use January revenue data for the cohort of customers who first signed subscription agreements in the preceding year because January is the first month in which we are earning a full month of revenue from all such customers. Building upon this success, we believe a significant opportunity exists for us to acquire new customers as well as expand the use of our platform by increasing the number of users within our current customers' organizations.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, we provide investors with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding, which we collectively refer to as non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude all or a combination of the following (as reflected in the following reconciliation tables): stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of warrant liability and loss on extinguishment of debt. We define non-GAAP operating loss as operating loss before stock-based compensation expense. We define non-GAAP net loss as net loss before stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of warrant liability and loss on extinguishment of debt. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past\nfinancial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision making. While our non-GAAP financial measures are an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time, you should review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nWe exclude stock-based compensation expense because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact our non-cash expense. We believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allow for more meaningful comparisons between our operating results from period to period. We exclude the impact of change in the fair value of warrant liability and loss on extinguishment of debt as these costs are unrelated to current operations nor predictive of future results, which we believe allows for a more meaningful comparison between the operating results from period to period. Accordingly, we believe that excluding these expenses provides investors and management with greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business operations, facilitates comparison of our results with other periods and may also provide comparison with the results of other companies in our industry.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have uniform definitions and our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of the compensation provided to our employees.\nThe following table reconciles GAAP operating loss to non-GAAP operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td>

Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily through sales of subscriptions to our platform, as well as professional services.

In certain instances, we have had customers pay their entire contract value up front.\nOur revenue is comprised of the following:\nSubscriptions, Software and Support\nSubscriptions, software and support revenue is primarily derived from:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>SaaS subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>on-premises term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> To a lesser extent, we also generate revenue from the sale of perpetual software license agreements and associated maintenance and support.\nOur maintenance and support agreements provide customers with the right to unspecified software upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the maintenance and support agreement on a when-and-if-available basis, and rights to technical support. When our platform is deployed within a customer's own data center or private cloud, it is installed on the customer's infrastructure and offered as a term or perpetual license. When our platform is delivered as a SaaS subscription, we handle its operational needs in third-party hosted data centers.\nProfessional Services\nOur professional services revenue is comprised of fees for consulting services, including application development and deployment assistance and training related to our platform. Over time, as the need for professional services associated with user deployments decreases and the number of end users increases, we expect the mix of total revenue to shift more toward subscription revenue. We have several strategic partnerships, including with Deloitte, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Our agreements with our strategic partners have indefinite terms and may be terminated for convenience by either party. We intend to further grow our base of strategic partners to provide broader customer coverage and solution delivery capabilities. These partners refer software subscription customers to us and perform professional services with respect to any new service contracts they originate, increasing our software subscription revenue without any change to our professional services revenue. As we expand the network of strategic partners, we expect professional services revenue to decline as a percentage of total revenue over time since our strategic partners may perform professional services associated with software subscriptions that we sell.\nCost of Revenue\nSubscriptions, Software and Support\nCost of subscriptions, software and support revenue consists primarily of fees paid to our third-party managed hosting providers and other third-party service providers, personnel costs, including payroll and benefits for our technology operations and customer support teams, and allocated facility costs and overhead. We expect cost of revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as our customer base grows.\nProfessional Services\nCost of professional services revenue includes all direct and indirect costs to deliver our professional services and training, including employee compensation for our global professional services and training personnel, travel costs, third-party contractor costs and allocated facility costs and overhead. The unpredictability of the timing of entering into significant professional services agreements sold on a standalone basis may cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results.\nGross Margin\nGross profit and gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of total revenue, has been, and will continue to be, affected by various factors, including the mix of subscription, software and support revenue and professional services revenue. Subscription pricing, the costs associated with third-party hosting facilities, and the extent to which we expand our professional services to support future growth will impact our gross margins. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period based on the above factors.\nSubscriptions, Software and Support Gross Margin. Subscriptions, software and support gross margin is primarily affected by the growth in our subscriptions, software and support revenue as compared to the growth in, and timing of, costs to support such revenue. We expect to continue to invest in the customer support and SaaS operations to support the growth in the business and the timing of those investments is expected to cause gross margins to fluctuate in the short term but improve over time.\nProfessional Services Gross Margin. Professional services gross margin is affected by the growth in our professional services revenue as compared to the growth in, and timing of, the cost of our professional services organization as we continue to invest in the growth of our business. Professional services gross margin is also impacted by the ratable recognition of some of our professional services revenue as compared to the recognition of related costs of services in the period incurred, as well as the amount of services performed by subcontractors as opposed to internal resources.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Salaries, bonuses and other personnel-related costs are the most significant components of each of these expense\ncategories. We grew from 719 employees at December 31, 2016 to 859 employees at December 31, 2017, and we expect to continue to hire new employees in order to support our anticipated revenue growth.\nSales and Marketing Expense\nSales and marketing expense primarily includes personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, commissions, stock-based compensation and other personnel costs related to sales teams. Additional expenses in this category include travel and entertainment, marketing and promotional events, marketing activities, subcontracting fees and allocated facility costs and overhead.\nThe number of employees in sales and marketing functions grew from 238 at December 31, 2016 to 307 at December 31, 2017. In order to continue to grow our business, geographical footprint and brand awareness, we expect to continue investing resources in sales and marketing by increasing the number of sales and account management teams. As a result, we expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest to acquire new customers and further expand usage of our platform within our existing customer base.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our employees who develop and enhance our platform, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and other personnel costs. Also included are non personnel costs such as subcontracting, consulting and professional fees to third party development resources, allocated facility costs, overhead and depreciation and amortization costs.\nOur research and development efforts are focused on enhancing the speed and power of our software platform. The number of employees in research and development functions grew from 145 at December 31, 2016 to 192 at December 31, 2017. We expect research and development expenses to continue to increase as they are critical to maintain and improve our quality of applications and our competitive position.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and other personnel costs for our administrative, legal, information technology, human resources, finance and accounting employees and executives. Additional expenses included in this category are non-personnel costs, such as travel-related expenses, contracting and professional fees, audit fees, tax services and legal fees, as well as insurance and other corporate expenses, along with allocated facility costs and overhead.\nThe number of employees in general and administrative functions grew from 86 at December 31, 2016 to 98 at December 31, 2017. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support our growth and as a result of our becoming a public company.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data:\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscriptions, software and support\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services\n</td> <td>85,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>176,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue(1):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscriptions, software and support\n</td> <td>9,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services\n</td> <td>55,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>64,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>112,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses(1):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>81,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>34,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>27,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>143,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>(31,811\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,370\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,842\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>(2,038\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other (income) expense\n</td> <td>(1,565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(30,246\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,144\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,609\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,683\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31,007\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,461\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,987\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes stock-based compensation expense below.

Contractor costs increased in 2017 compared to 2016 because of an increase in the usage of third-party resources for professional service engagements. Personnel costs increased due to $1.9 million in stock-based compensation expense and an increase in the number of experienced professional services employees in 2017. Billable expenses increased because we had more professional services engagements in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in other cost of revenue is due to increased hosting costs as sales of our cloud offering increased in 2017. The decrease in facility and overhead costs was due to decreased rent expense.\nGross margin increased to 63.5% in 2017 compared to 62.3% in 2016 due to an increase in the gross margin of our subscriptions, software and support revenue as well as our professional services revenue. Our revenue mix remained relatively constant in 2017 compared to 2016.

Personnel costs increased due to the increase in general and administrative personnel headcount by 32.3% from the end of 2015 to the end of 2016. Facility and overhead costs as well as contractor costs increased to support our personnel growth.\nSeasonality\nWe have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into agreements with customers. We typically enter into a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter. The increase in customer agreements for the fourth quarter is attributable to large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry. Furthermore, we usually enter into a significant portion of agreements with customers during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. However, we recognize substantially all of our revenue ratably over the terms of our subscription agreements, which generally occurs over a one to five-year period. As a result, a substantial portion of the revenue that we report in each period will be derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements entered into during previous periods. Consequently, a decline in new sales or renewals in any one period may not be immediately reflected in our revenue results for that period. This decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future periods. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our platform and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods.\nBacklog\nBacklog represents future amounts to be invoiced and recognized under subscription agreements. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had backlog of approximately $214 million and $167 million, respectively. Approximately 58% of our backlog as of December 31, 2017 is not expected to be filled in 2018.\nWe expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from quarter to quarter and year to year for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe often sign multiple-year subscription agreements, the length in years of which may vary widely. Backlog may vary based on changes in the average non-cancellable term of subscription agreements. The change in backlog that results from changes in the average non-cancellable term of subscription agreements may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or expected future revenue. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not a reliable indicator of future revenue, and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $73.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. On May 31, 2017, we closed our IPO of 7,187,500 shares of our Class A common stock at an offering price of $12.00 per share, including 937,500 shares pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional Class A shares, resulting in net proceeds to us of $77.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.0 million and offering expenses of $2.4 million.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with any positive cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our line of credit, will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, particularly internationally, and the introduction of new and enhanced products and functions, platform enhancements and professional services offerings and the level of market acceptance of our applications. In the event that additional financing is\nrequired from outside sources, we may be unable to raise the funds on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent existing cash and cash equivalents and investments and cash from operations are not sufficient to fund future activities, we may need to raise additional funds. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness may have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict operations. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Although we are not currently a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies, we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek additional equity financing, incur indebtedness, or use cash resources. We have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any such acquisitions. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,128\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,756\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,145\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(433\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(984\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(524\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>50,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSources of Funds\nWe have financed our operations in large part with equity and debt financing arrangements, including net proceeds of $10.0 million from the sale of shares of preferred stock over a period of several years prior to our IPO and the net proceeds from our IPO, as well as through sales of software and professional services and borrowings under our credit facilities.\n2015 Line of Credit\nAt December 31, 2015, we had a $10.0 million revolving line of credit with a lender, expiring in June 2016, which was subsequently amended in June 2016 to extend the maturity date through June 2017, and which was terminated in April 2017. The amount of borrowing available under the credit facility at any time could not exceed 80% of eligible accounts receivable at such time and any amounts borrowed were collateralized by substantially all of our assets. Amounts drawn on the revolving line of credit accrued interest at a floating rate of prime plus 0.75%. The agreement contained certain affirmative covenants related to the timely delivery of financial information to the lender and maintaining a liquidity ratio of at least 1.25 to 1, as well as certain customary negative covenants.\n2015 Term Loan\nIn March 2015, we entered into a collateralized $10.0 million term loan facility with a lender, maturing in March 2019 and borrowed the full amount under the term loan facility in June 2015. In January 2016, we paid off the outstanding balance of the term loan and simultaneously entered into a $20.0 million term loan facility with the lender, maturing in January 2020. We borrowed the full amount under the term loan facility in January 2016, which we repaid in full in April 2017.\nInterest on the term loan borrowings accrued at a floating rate equal to the prime rate plus 1.25%. Initially, the first 12 months were to require interest-only payments followed by 36 months of monthly amortization payments. In contemplation of the new financing facility described below, the interest-only period was extended until the new financing facility was finalized. We were permitted to pay off the entire term loan at any time by paying all outstanding principal, accrued interest, and a prepayment fee of 1% of the amount advanced through month 12, 0.5% during months 13 through 24 and no prepayment fee thereafter. The term loan included a financial covenant related to our short-term liquidity.\n2017 Financing Facility\nIn April 2017, we entered into a new financing facility consisting of a $5.0 million senior revolving credit facility, a $20.0 million senior term loan and a $10.0 million subordinated term loan. In connection with the execution of this financing facility, the prior line of credit was terminated, and we borrowed the full $20.0 million available under the senior term loan and repaid the outstanding balance under our prior term loan. Additionally, in connection with the execution of our new financing facility, the lender waived the prepayment fee associated with our prior line of credit.\nAmounts drawn on the senior revolving credit facility bore interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate plus 0.75%. The facility matured in April 2019, contained covenants related to our short-term liquidity and was collateralized by all of our assets.\nBorrowings under the senior term loan bore interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate plus 1.25%. Borrowings were required to be repaid over 48 months, consisting of 12 months of interest-only payments followed by 36 months of principal and interest payments. We could pay off the entire senior term loan at any time by paying all outstanding principal, accrued interest, and a prepayment fee of 2% of the amount borrowed if repaid through month 12, 1% of the amount borrowed if repaid during months 13 through 24 and no prepayment fee if repaid thereafter. The senior term loan included a financial covenant related to our short-term liquidity and was collateralized by all of our assets.\nBorrowings under the subordinated term loan bore interest at an initial rate of 11%, which increased by 1% upon each anniversary of the closing date of the financing facility. The facility matured in April 2020. Interest-only payments were required through maturity, and the principal balance was due upon maturity. We were able to borrow amounts under the subordinated term loan within the first 12 months after closing. We could pay off the entire subordinated term loan at any time by paying all outstanding principal, accrued interest, and a final payment fee of 5% of the amount borrowed if repaid through month 12, 6% of the amount borrowed if repaid during months 13 through 24 and 7% of the amount borrowed if repaid thereafter. The subordinated term loan also carried an unused facility fee of 1.5% of the unused portion of the subordinated term loan, which was payable quarterly. The subordinated term loan included a financial covenant related to our recurring revenue and was collateralized by all of our assets.\nIn June 2017, we used proceeds from our IPO to pay all remaining outstanding principal and interest under the senior term loan and subsequently terminated the senior term loan and subordinated term loan. This financing facility was terminated in November 2017 in connection with our entry into a new $20.0 million revolving line of credit.\n2017 Line of Credit\nIn November 2017, we entered into a $20.0 million revolving line of credit with a lender. The facility matures in November 2022. We may elect whether amounts drawn on the revolving line of credit bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to either the LIBOR or the prime rate plus an additional interest rate margin that is determined by the availability of borrowings under the revolving line of credit. The additional interest rate margin will range from 2.00% to 2.50% in the case of LIBOR advances and from 1.00% to 1.50% in the case of prime rate advances. The revolving line of credit contains an unused facility fee in an amount between 0.15% and 0.25% of the average unused portion of the revolving line of credit, which is payable quarterly. The agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and requires us to maintain (i) an adjusted quick ratio of at least 1.35 to 1.0 and (ii) minimum adjusted EBITDA, in the amounts and for the periods set forth in the agreement. Any amounts borrowed under the credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had not made any borrowings under this new revolving line of credit and we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.1 million under the 2017 line of credit in connection with securing our leased office space.\nUse of Funds\nOur principal uses of cash are funding operations and other working capital requirements. Over the past several years, revenue has increased significantly from year to year and, as a result, cash flows from customer collections have increased. However, operating expenses have also increased as we have invested in growing our business. Our operating cash requirements may increase in the future as we continue to invest in the strategic growth of our company.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities of $9.1 million consisted of a net loss of $31.0 million, offset by $14.4 million in adjustments for non-cash items and $7.5 million of cash provided by changes in working capital. Adjustments for non-cash items consisted of stock-based compensation of $13.0 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $0.9 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.4 million and fair value adjustment for the warrant liability of $0.3 million, offset by a provision for deferred income taxes of $0.2 million. The increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $18.3 million, as a result of increased subscription sales, a $4.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a $2.4 million increase in accrued compensation and related benefits, primarily due to the timing of year-end bonus payments. This increase\nwas partially offset by a $9.7 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of billings, a $4.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets and a $3.5 million increase in deferred commissions due to increased sales.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities of $7.8 million consisted of a net loss of $12.5 million and $0.2 million in adjustments for non-cash items, partially offset by $4.9 million of cash provided by changes in working capital. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of a provision for deferred income taxes of $1.1 million, partially offset by depreciation and amortization expense of $0.8 million and a fair value adjustment for our warrant liability of $0.2 million. The increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $17.4 million as a result of increased subscription sales and a $3.7 million increase in accrued compensation and related benefits as a result of our increasing headcount. These increases were partially offset by an $11.2 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of billings and a higher level of sales, and a $5.3 million increase in deferred commissions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in operating activities of $2.1 million consisted of a net loss of $7.0 million, partially offset by $4.1 million of cash provided by changes in working capital and $0.8 million in adjustments for non-cash items. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $0.8 million and a fair value adjustment for our warrant liability of $0.3 million, partially offset by a provision for deferred income taxes of $0.3 million. The increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $15.5 million as a result of increased subscription sales, partially offset by a $6.6 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of billings and a higher level of sales, and a $4.0 million increase in deferred commissions.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $0.4 million, $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for the purchase of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $50.9 million, consisting of $80.2 million in proceeds from our IPO, net of underwriting discounts, $19.6 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of issuance costs and $1.1 million in proceeds received from stock option exercises. These increases were offset by the repayment of $40.0 million of long-term debt, a $7.6 million dividend payment to the Series A preferred stockholders and the payment of deferred IPO costs of $2.4 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $10.0 million, consisting of $20.0 million in net borrowings under our term loan, partially offset by $10.0 million in repayments of debt.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $10.0 million, consisting of $10.0 million in net borrowings under our term loan.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease commitments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(1)\n</td> <td>1,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>26,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) We have annual royalty fees of $0.3 million for a non-cancellable agreement for the use of technology that is integral in\nthe development of our software. No amounts were included in the \"More than 5 Years\" column as this agreement is perpetual and will be required as long as we continue to use the technology.\nThe commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. The table does not include obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty. As of December 31, 2017, we had not made any borrowings under our $20.0 million revolving line of credit.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. We therefore believe that we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our other significant accounting policies. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those financial statements and accompanying notes. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\nSignificant estimates embedded in the consolidated financial statements for the period presented include revenue recognition, stock-based compensation and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue primarily through sales of subscriptions to our platform, as well as professional services. We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service or product has been provided to the customer; (3) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection of related fees is reasonably assured. If collection is not reasonably assured, we defer revenue recognition until collectability becomes reasonably assured. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return.\nSubscriptions, Software and Support Revenue\nSubscriptions, software and support revenue is primarily related to (1) SaaS subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services and (2) term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support. To a lesser extent, we also generate revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses and associated maintenance and support.\nHistorically, we licensed our software primarily under perpetual licenses, but over time we transitioned from perpetual licenses to subscriptions. As a result, revenue from our perpetual software licenses was less than 1.0% of our total revenue for 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 1.9% of our total revenue in 2015.\nWe generally sell our software on a per-user basis. We bill customers and collect payment for subscriptions to our platform in advance on an annual, quarterly or monthly basis. In certain instances, we have had customers pay their entire contract up front.\nSaaS Subscriptions\nOur SaaS subscription revenue is derived from customers accessing our cloud offering pursuant to contracts that are generally one to five years in length. We perform all required maintenance and support for our cloud offering and we do not separately charge customers for hosting costs. In these arrangements, our customers do not have the right to take the software on-premises and, as a result, such arrangements are not accounted for within the scope of the software revenue guidance. Revenue from SaaS subscriptions is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription, beginning with the date our service is made available to our customer.\nTerm License Subscriptions\nOur term license subscription revenue is derived from customers with on-premises installations of our platform pursuant to contracts that are generally one to five years in length. Customers with term license subscriptions have the right to use our software and receive maintenance and support. Since we do not sell maintenance and support separately from the subscription, revenue for the term license subscription and maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription, upon delivery of the platform to the customer when sold on a standalone basis.\nProfessional Services\nOur professional services revenue is comprised of fees for consulting services, including application development and deployment assistance and training related to our platform. Our professional services are not essential to the functionality of our platform because the platform is ready for the customer's use immediately upon delivery and is not modified or customized in any manner.\nConsulting services are billed under both time-and-material and fixed-fee arrangements. For standalone time-and-material contracts, we recognize revenue at contractually agreed upon billing rates applied to hours performed. For standalone fixed-fee contracts, we also recognize revenue as the work is performed using the proportional performance method of accounting. Training revenue is recognized when the associated training services are delivered. Training is also sold in the form of a subscription arrangement where a customer agrees to pay an annual fixed fee for a fixed number of users to have access to all of our training offerings during the year. Revenue from training subscription agreements is recognized ratably over the subscription period.\nWe defer recognition of revenue from work performed on pending contract modifications until the period in which the modifications are accepted and funding is approved by the customer. Costs of work performed on pending contract modifications are expensed as incurred.\nMultiple Element Arrangements\nOur multiple element arrangements are from SaaS subscriptions and term license subscriptions that are generally sold in combination with maintenance and support service and frequently with professional services.\nSaaS Subscriptions\nFor multiple element arrangements involving SaaS subscriptions that include professional services in addition to the subscription to our platform, we evaluate each element to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. Because there are third-party vendors who routinely sell and provide the same professional services to our customers, our professional services are deemed to have standalone value apart from the SaaS subscription. Additionally, we offer both SaaS subscriptions and professional services on a standalone basis. Professional services revenue is therefore accounted for separately from subscription fees and recognized as the professional services are performed. We allocate revenue to the elements based on the selling price hierarchy using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price, or if neither exists, best estimated selling price, or BESP. In cases where we do not have VSOE or TPE of the elements of our arrangements, we use BESP to allocate revenue. We determine BESP for a service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, evaluating the weighted average of actual sales prices and other factors such as gross margin objectives, pricing practices and growth strategy. Pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Once the revenue is allocated to these elements, revenue is recognized as such services are provided.\nTerm License Subscriptions\nFor multiple element arrangements involving term license subscriptions, maintenance and support and professional services, we do not have VSOE of fair value for the maintenance and support. Our term license subscriptions are generally not sold on a standalone basis, and therefore, we have not established VSOE of fair value for the subscriptions. Consequently, for our bundled arrangements that include certain professional services, there are two undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established and, therefore, we utilize the combined services approach and defer all revenue until the software has been delivered and the provision of all services has commenced. We then recognize the entire fee from the arrangement ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement, assuming all other software revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nDeferred Commissions\nDeferred commissions are the incremental costs that are directly associated with subscription agreements with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to our direct sales force. Commissions are considered direct and incremental and as such\nare deferred and amortized over the terms of the related customer contracts consistent with the related revenue. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had total deferred commissions of $21.5 million and $18.0 million, respectively. Commission expense was $11.8 million, $6.5 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. The fair value is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award, on a straight-line basis when the only condition to vesting is continued service. For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized using the accelerated attribution method, based on the probability of satisfying the performance condition. For awards that contain market conditions, compensation expense is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model and recognized using the accelerated attribution method over the derived service period based on the expected market performance as of the grant date. We account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimating expected forfeitures.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the use of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option, the current price of the underlying stock, the expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option. The expected term represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding. Due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected term of the stock options, we use the simplified method to estimate the expected term for its stock options. Under the simplified method, the expected term of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities for publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected term of the stock options. We assume no dividend yield because dividends on our common stock are not expected to be paid in the near future, which is consistent with our history of not paying dividends on our common stock.\nThe fair value of RSUs is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nPrior to our IPO in May 2017, we were a private company with no active public market for our common stock. Therefore, in response to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, related regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service and accounting standards related to stock-based compensation, we periodically determined for financial reporting purposes the estimated per share fair value of our common stock at various dates using contemporaneous valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.\u201d\nFollowing our IPO, we established a policy of using the closing sale price per share of our Class A common stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant for purposes of determining the exercise price per share of our options to purchase common stock.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nOur tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority. We measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.\nWe calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make that determination.\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted, substantially changing the U.S. federal tax system. Notable provisions of the TCJA include the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, the imposition of a one-time transition tax on unremitted cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and the implementation of a territorial tax system. While the changes from the TCJA are generally effective beginning in 2018, U.S. GAAP accounting for income taxes requires the effect of a change in tax laws or rates to be recognized in income from continuing operations for the period that includes the enactment date. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the TCJA, SAB No. 118 allows us to record provisional amounts in earnings for the year ending December 31, 2017. Where reasonable estimates can be made, the provisional accounting should be based on such estimates. When no reasonable estimate can be made, the provisional accounting may be based on the tax law in effect before the TCJA. We are required to complete our tax accounting for the TCJA in the period when it has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information to complete the income tax accounting.\nWe have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the TCJA; however, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects of the TCJA on our financial statements which are included as a component of income tax expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for information related to recently issued accounting standards.\nJOBS Act Transition Period\nIn April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards and to adopt certain of the reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. As a result of the accounting standards election, we will not be subject to the same implementation timing for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult.", "item_7_truncated": "Revenue Recognition\n\n\nCost of Revenue\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease commitments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(1)\n</td> <td>1,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>26,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses.

We exclude the impact of change in the fair value of warrant liability and loss on extinguishment of debt as these costs are unrelated to current operations nor predictive of future results, which we believe allows for a more meaningful comparison between the operating results from period to period. Accordingly, we believe that excluding these expenses provides investors and management with greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business operations, facilitates comparison of our results with other periods and may also provide comparison with the results of other companies in our industry.\nSales and Marketing Expense\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expense primarily includes personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, commissions, stock-based compensation and other personnel costs related to sales teams.

third-party managed hosting providers and other third-party service providers, personnel costs, including payroll and benefits for our technology operations and customer support teams, and allocated facility costs and overhead. We expect cost of revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as our customer base grows.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the use of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option, the current price of the underlying stock, the expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option. The expected term represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding. Due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected term of the stock options, we use the simplified method to estimate the expected term for its stock options. Under the simplified method, the expected term of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities for publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected term of the stock options. We assume no dividend yield because dividends on our common stock are not expected to be paid in the near future, which is consistent with our history of not paying dividends on our common stock.\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of revenue\n</td> <td>17.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur business model focuses on maximizing the lifetime value of customer relationships, which is a function of the duration of a customer's deployment of Appian as well as the price and number of subscriptions of Appian that a customer purchases. The costs we incur with respect to any customer may exceed revenue from that customer in earlier periods because we generally recognize costs associated with customer acquisition faster than we generate and recognize the associated revenue. We incur significant customer acquisition costs, including expenses associated with hiring new sales representatives, who generally take more than one year to become productive given the length of our sales cycle, and marketing costs, all of which are expensed as incurred. Our customer contract terms vary from one to five years, with an average length of three years, with most providing for payment in advance on an annual, quarterly or monthly basis, and we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the subscription period.\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscriptions, software and support\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services\n</td> <td>1,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>3,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>2,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>5,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubscriptions, software and support revenue is primarily related to (1) SaaS subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services and (2) term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support.

Backlog may vary based on changes in the average non-cancellable term of subscription agreements. The change in backlog that results from changes in the average non-cancellable term of subscription agreements may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or expected future revenue. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not a reliable indicator of future revenue, and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of revenue\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubscriptions, Software and Support Gross Margin. Subscriptions, software and support gross margin is primarily affected by the growth in our subscriptions, software and support revenue as compared to the growth in, and timing of, costs to support such revenue. We expect to continue to invest in the customer support and SaaS operations to support the growth in the business and the timing of those investments is expected to cause gross margins to fluctuate in the short term but improve over time.\nOur platform is designed to be natively multi-lingual to facilitate collaboration and address challenges in multi-national organizations. We offer our platform globally. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, 27.0%, 19.5% and 19.9%, respectively, of our total revenue was generated from customers outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2017, we operated in 11 countries. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to grow our international footprint. We are investing in new geographies, including through investment in direct and indirect sales channels, professional services and customer support and implementation partners.\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31,007\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,461\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,987\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>12,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of warrant liability\n</td> <td>341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>299\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17,306\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,261\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,688\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. We therefore believe that we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs.

The increase in professional services revenue was due to $9.3 million of additional revenue from existing customers and $13.0 million in sales to new customers. The increase in subscription revenue was attributable to $17.1 million of revenue from expanded deployments and corresponding sales of additional subscriptions to existing customers and $4.4 million in sales of subscriptions to new customers.\nOur research and development efforts are focused on enhancing the speed and power of our software platform. The number of employees in research and development functions grew from 145 at December 31, 2016 to 192 at December 31, 2017. We expect research and development expenses to continue to increase as they are critical to maintain and improve our quality of applications and our competitive position.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data:\nBorrowings under the subordinated term loan bore interest at an initial rate of 11%, which increased by 1% upon each anniversary of the closing date of the financing facility. The facility matured in April 2020. Interest-only payments were required through maturity, and the principal balance was due upon maturity. We were able to borrow amounts under the subordinated term loan within the first 12 months after closing. We could pay off the entire subordinated term loan at any time by paying all outstanding principal, accrued interest, and a final payment fee of 5% of the amount borrowed if repaid through month 12, 6% of the amount borrowed if repaid during months 13 through 24 and 7% of the amount borrowed if repaid thereafter. The subordinated term loan also carried an unused facility fee of 1.5% of the unused portion of the subordinated term loan, which was payable quarterly. The subordinated term loan included a financial covenant related to our recurring revenue and was collateralized by all of our assets.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and other personnel costs for our administrative, legal, information technology, human resources, finance and accounting employees and executives. Additional expenses included in this category are non-personnel costs, such as travel-related expenses, contracting and professional fees, audit fees, tax services and legal fees, as well as insurance and other corporate expenses, along with allocated facility costs and overhead.\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted, substantially changing the U.S. federal tax system. Notable provisions of the TCJA include the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, the imposition of a one-time transition tax on unremitted cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and the implementation of a territorial tax system. While the changes from the TCJA are generally effective beginning in 2018, U.S. GAAP accounting for income taxes requires the effect of a change in tax laws or rates to be recognized in income from continuing operations for the period that includes the enactment date. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the TCJA, SAB No. 118 allows us to record provisional amounts in earnings for the year ending December 31, 2017. Where reasonable estimates can be made, the provisional accounting should be based on such estimates. When no reasonable estimate can be made, the provisional accounting may be based on the tax law in effect before the TCJA. We are required to complete our tax accounting for the TCJA in the period when it has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information to complete the income tax accounting.\nThe following table sets forth our non-GAAP net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands except share and per share data):\nare deferred and amortized over the terms of the related customer contracts consistent with the related revenue. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had total deferred commissions of $21.5 million and $18.0 million, respectively. Commission expense was $11.8 million, $6.5 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nSales and Marketing Expense\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nWe measure the effectiveness of our business model by comparing the lifetime value of our customer relationships to our customer acquisition costs. We calculate lifetime customer value as (1) average gross margin multiplied by average subscription and maintenance and support revenue from customers for a given month divided by (2) the average percentage of monthly recurring revenue that did not renew in each month for the previous 12 months. We then divide this calculated lifetime customer value by our customer acquisition cost, which is the total sales and marketing expense incurred during the corresponding month. On a rolling twelve month basis, we estimate that for each of 2017, 2016 and 2015 the average lifetime value of a customer has exceeded 7x the associated average cost of acquiring them.\nIn 2016 and 2017, we have generated the majority of our revenue from sales of subscriptions, software and support, which include (1) SaaS subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services, and (2) term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support. To a lesser extent, we also generate revenue from the sale of perpetual software license agreements and associated maintenance and support agreements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $10.0 million, consisting of $10.0 million in net borrowings under our term loan.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe number of employees in general and administrative functions grew from 86 at December 31, 2016 to 98 at December 31, 2017. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support our growth and as a result of our becoming a public company.\nThe following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nWe defer recognition of revenue from work performed on pending contract modifications until the period in which the modifications are accepted and funding is approved by the customer. Costs of work performed on pending contract modifications are expensed as incurred.\nProfessional Services Gross Margin. Professional services gross margin is affected by the growth in our professional services revenue as compared to the growth in, and timing of, the cost of our professional services organization as we continue to invest in the growth of our business. Professional services gross margin is also impacted by the ratable recognition of some of our professional services revenue as compared to the recognition of related costs of services in the period incurred, as well as the amount of services performed by subcontractors as opposed to internal resources.\nDeferred commissions are the incremental costs that are directly associated with subscription agreements with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to our direct sales force. Commissions are considered direct and incremental and as such\nIn April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards and to adopt certain of the reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. As a result of the accounting standards election, we will not be subject to the same implementation timing for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult.\nGross margin increased to 63.5% in 2017 compared to 62.3% in 2016 due to an increase in the gross margin of our subscriptions, software and support revenue as well as our professional services revenue. Our revenue mix remained relatively constant in 2017 compared to 2016. The gross margin of our professional services revenue in 2016 was negatively impacted by temporarily low utilization of professional services resources as they were being redeployed after the completion of a large engagement in the prior quarter.\n\n\nstock-based compensation expense was recognized for our stock option awards because a qualifying event had not yet occurred.\n\nInterest on the term loan borrowings accrued at a floating rate equal to the prime rate plus 1.25%. Initially, the first 12 months were to require interest-only payments followed by 36 months of monthly amortization payments. In contemplation of the new financing facility described below, the interest-only period was extended until the new financing facility was finalized. We were permitted to pay off the entire term loan at any time by paying all outstanding principal, accrued interest, and a prepayment fee of 1% of the amount advanced through month 12, 0.5% during months 13 through 24 and no prepayment fee thereafter. The term loan included a financial covenant related to our short-term liquidity.\nWe have financed our operations in large part with equity and debt financing arrangements, including net proceeds of $10.0 million from the sale of shares of preferred stock over a period of several years prior to our IPO and the net proceeds from our IPO, as well as through sales of software and professional services and borrowings under our credit facilities.\nRevenue\nAt December 31, 2015, we had a $10.0 million revolving line of credit with a lender, expiring in June 2016, which was subsequently amended in June 2016 to extend the maturity date through June 2017, and which was terminated in April 2017. The amount of borrowing available under the credit facility at any time could not exceed 80% of eligible accounts receivable at such time and any amounts borrowed were collateralized by substantially all of our assets. Amounts drawn on the revolving line of credit accrued interest at a floating rate of prime plus 0.75%. The agreement contained certain affirmative covenants related to the timely delivery of financial information to the lender and maintaining a liquidity ratio of at least 1.25 to 1, as well as certain customary negative covenants.\nSubscription Revenue\nTerm License Subscriptions\n \u2022 SaaS subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services; and \nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenue:\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $10.1 million, or 59.3%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $7.1 million increase in general and administrative personnel costs, a $1.1 million increase in professional fees, a $1.0 million increase in facility and overhead costs and a $0.9 million increase in legal costs. Personnel costs increased due to $5.1 million in stock-based compensation expense in 2017 and an increase in general and administrative personnel headcount by 14.0% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 in order to support the additional requirements of being a public company. Professional fees increased due to use of consulting services to assist with the implementation of new software to support our back-office functions as well as costs incurred during the secondary offering in November 2017. Facility and overhead costs increased to support our personnel growth. Legal costs increased due to costs incurred during the secondary offering as well as the settlement of certain legal matters.\nTerm License Subscriptions\n\nSources of Funds\nWe focus on acquiring new customers and growing our relationships with existing customers over time. The chart below illustrates our history of attracting new customers and expanding our revenue from them over time as they realize the benefits of building applications using our software.\nThe number of employees in sales and marketing functions grew from 238 at December 31, 2016 to 307 at December 31, 2017. In order to continue to grow our business, geographical footprint and brand awareness, we expect to continue investing resources in sales and marketing by increasing the number of sales and account management teams. As a result, we expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest to acquire new customers and further expand usage of our platform within our existing customer base.\nWe generate revenue primarily through sales of subscriptions to our platform, as well as professional services. We generally sell our software on a per-user basis. We generally bill customers and collect payment for subscriptions to our platform in advance on an annual, quarterly or monthly basis. In certain instances, we have had customers pay their entire contract value up front.\nProfessional Services\nCost of professional services revenue includes all direct and indirect costs to deliver our professional services and training, including employee compensation for our global professional services and training personnel, travel costs, third-party contractor costs and allocated facility costs and overhead. The unpredictability of the timing of entering into significant professional services agreements sold on a standalone basis may cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results.\nCost of revenue increased $1.6 million, or 3.4%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $5.8 million increase in professional services and product support staff personnel costs and a $1.2 million increase in facility and overhead costs, offset by decreases in contractor costs of $5.4 million. Personnel costs increased due to the increase in professional services and customer support staff personnel headcount by 4.6% from the end of 2015 to the end of 2016. Facility and overhead costs increased to support our personnel growth. Contractor costs decreased from 2015 to 2016 as we incurred additional contractor costs in 2015 to support a new customer contract.\nWe have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the TCJA; however, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects of the TCJA on our financial statements which are included as a component of income tax expense.\nWe believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our other significant accounting policies. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those financial statements and accompanying notes. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\nCustomer Cohort Analysis\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nBacklog\nResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our employees who develop and enhance our platform, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and other personnel costs. Also included are non personnel costs such as subcontracting, consulting and professional fees to third party development resources, allocated facility costs, overhead and depreciation and amortization costs.\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, we provide investors with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding, which we collectively refer to as non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude all or a combination of the following (as reflected in the following reconciliation tables): stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of warrant liability and loss on extinguishment of debt. We define non-GAAP operating loss as operating loss before stock-based compensation expense. We define non-GAAP net loss as net loss before stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of warrant liability and loss on extinguishment of debt. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past\nIn March 2015, we entered into a collateralized $10.0 million term loan facility with a lender, maturing in March 2019 and borrowed the full amount under the term loan facility in June 2015. In January 2016, we paid off the outstanding balance of the term loan and simultaneously entered into a $20.0 million term loan facility with the lender, maturing in January 2020. We borrowed the full amount under the term loan facility in January 2016, which we repaid in full in April 2017.\n \u2022 on-premises term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support.  To a lesser extent, we also generate revenue from the sale of perpetual software license agreements and associated maintenance and support.\n \u2022 Further Penetration of Existing Customers. Our sales force seeks to generate additional revenue from existing customers by adding new users to our platform. Many of our customers begin by building a single application and then grow to build dozens of applications on our platform. Generally, the development of new applications on our platform results in the expansion of our user base within an organization and a corresponding increase in revenue to us because we charge subscription fees on a per-user basis for the significant majority of our customer contracts. As a result of this land and expand\u201d strategy, we have generated significant additional revenue from our customer base. Our ability to increase sales to existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including the size of our sales force and professional services teams, customers' level of satisfaction with our platform and professional services, pricing, economic conditions and our customers' overall spending levels. \n\nWe provide a leading low-code software development platform as a service that enables organizations to rapidly develop powerful and unique applications. The applications created on our platform help companies drive digital transformation and competitive differentiation.\nProfessional Services\nFollowing our IPO, we established a policy of using the closing sale price per share of our Class A common stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant for purposes of determining the exercise price per share of our options to purchase common stock.\nResults of Operations\n\nThe chart reflects annualized subscription revenue for the group of customers that became our customers in each respective cohort year. For instance, the 2014 cohort includes all customers whose contract start date was between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014. Annualized subscription revenue is the total amount of daily subscription revenue for that applicable customer cohort in January of the following year multiplied by 365. We use January revenue data for the cohort of customers who first signed subscription agreements in the preceding year because January is the first month in which we are earning a full month of revenue from all such customers. Building upon this success, we believe a significant opportunity exists for us to acquire new customers as well as expand the use of our platform by increasing the number of users within our current customers' organizations.\nIn April 2017, we entered into a new financing facility consisting of a $5.0 million senior revolving credit facility, a $20.0 million senior term loan and a $10.0 million subordinated term loan. In connection with the execution of this financing facility, the prior line of credit was terminated, and we borrowed the full $20.0 million available under the senior term loan and repaid the outstanding balance under our prior term loan. Additionally, in connection with the execution of our new financing facility, the lender waived the prepayment fee associated with our prior line of credit.\nMultiple Element Arrangements\nOverview\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2017, we used proceeds from our IPO to pay all remaining outstanding principal and interest under the senior term loan and subsequently terminated the senior term loan and subordinated term loan. This financing facility was terminated in November 2017 in connection with our entry into a new $20.0 million revolving line of credit.\nfinancial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision making. While our non-GAAP financial measures are an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time, you should review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nOur revenue is comprised of the following:\nThe commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. The table does not include obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty. As of December 31, 2017, we had not made any borrowings under our $20.0 million revolving line of credit.\nWe generally sell our software on a per-user basis. We bill customers and collect payment for subscriptions to our platform in advance on an annual, quarterly or monthly basis. In certain instances, we have had customers pay their entire contract up front.\nSubscription revenue is a portion of our revenue contained in the subscriptions, software and support revenue line of our consolidated statements of operations, and includes (1) software as a service, or SaaS, subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services, and (2) term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support. As we generally sell our software on a per-user basis, our subscription revenue for any customer is primarily determined by the number of users who access and utilize the applications built on our platform, as well as the price paid. We believe that increasing our subscription revenue is an indicator of the demand for our platform, the pace at which the market for our solutions is growing, the productivity of our sales force and strategic relationships in growing our customer base, and our ability to further penetrate our existing customer base.\n2017 Line of Credit\nThe following table reconciles GAAP operating loss to non-GAAP operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nSales and marketing expense increased $27.8 million, or 51.4%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $21.2 million increase in sales and marketing personnel costs, a $3.5 million increase in facility and overhead costs, a $2.8 million increase in marketing costs and a $0.3 million increase in professional fees. Personnel costs increased due to $3.2 million in stock-based compensation expense in 2017, an increase in sales and marketing personnel headcount by 29.0% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, and increased sales commissions driven by our revenue growth. Facility and overhead costs increased to support our personnel growth. Marketing costs increased due to a rise in marketing event sponsorship and attendance. Professional fees increased due to an increase in consulting fees.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in operating activities of $2.1 million consisted of a net loss of $7.0 million, partially offset by $4.1 million of cash provided by changes in working capital and $0.8 million in adjustments for non-cash items. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $0.8 million and a fair value adjustment for our warrant liability of $0.3 million, partially offset by a provision for deferred income taxes of $0.3 million. The increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $15.5 million as a result of increased subscription sales, partially offset by a $6.6 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of billings and a higher level of sales, and a $4.0 million increase in deferred commissions.\nCost of Revenue\nPrior to our IPO in May 2017, we were a private company with no active public market for our common stock. Therefore, in response to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, related regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service and accounting standards related to stock-based compensation, we periodically determined for financial reporting purposes the estimated per share fair value of our common stock at various dates using contemporaneous valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.\u201d\nCost of revenue increased $14.5 million, or 28.9%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $6.0 million increase in contractor costs, a $5.3 million increase in professional services and product support staff personnel costs, a $2.6 million increase in billable expenses and a $0.7 million increase in other cost of revenue, offset by a $0.1 million decrease in facility and overhead costs. Contractor costs increased in 2017 compared to 2016 because of an increase in the usage of third-party resources for professional service engagements. Personnel costs increased due to $1.9 million in stock-based compensation expense and an increase in the number of experienced professional services employees in 2017. Billable expenses increased because we had more professional services engagements in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in other cost of revenue is due to increased hosting costs as sales of our cloud offering increased in 2017. The decrease in facility and overhead costs was due to decreased rent expense.\n\nFor multiple element arrangements involving SaaS subscriptions that include professional services in addition to the subscription to our platform, we evaluate each element to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. Because there are third-party vendors who routinely sell and provide the same professional services to our customers, our professional services are deemed to have standalone value apart from the SaaS subscription. Additionally, we offer both SaaS subscriptions and professional services on a standalone basis. Professional services revenue is therefore accounted for separately from subscription fees and recognized as the professional services are performed. We allocate revenue to the elements based on the selling price hierarchy using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price, or if neither exists, best estimated selling price, or BESP. In cases where we do not have VSOE or TPE of the elements of our arrangements, we use BESP to allocate revenue. We determine BESP for a service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, evaluating the weighted average of actual sales prices and other factors such as gross margin objectives, pricing practices and growth strategy. Pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Once the revenue is allocated to these elements, revenue is recognized as such services are provided.\nOur professional services revenue is comprised of fees for consulting services, including application development and deployment assistance and training related to our platform. Over time, as the need for professional services associated with user deployments decreases and the number of end users increases, we expect the mix of total revenue to shift more toward subscription revenue. We have several strategic partnerships, including with Deloitte, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Our agreements with our strategic partners have indefinite terms and may be terminated for convenience by either party. We intend to further grow our base of strategic partners to provide broader customer coverage and solution delivery capabilities. These partners refer software subscription customers to us and perform professional services with respect to any new service contracts they originate, increasing our software subscription revenue without any change to our professional services revenue. As we expand the network of strategic partners, we expect professional services revenue to decline as a percentage of total revenue over time since our strategic partners may perform professional services associated with software subscriptions that we sell.\nWe have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into agreements with customers. We typically enter into a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter. The increase in customer agreements for the fourth quarter is attributable to large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry. Furthermore, we usually enter into a significant portion of agreements with customers during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. However, we recognize substantially all of our revenue ratably over the terms of our subscription agreements, which generally occurs over a one to five-year period. As a result, a substantial portion of the revenue that we report in each period will be derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements entered into during previous periods. Consequently, a decline in new sales or renewals in any one period may not be immediately reflected in our revenue results for that period. This decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future periods. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our platform and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had 356 customers in a wide variety of industries, of which 285 customers were commercial and 71 customers were government or non-commercial entities. Our customers include financial services, healthcare, government, telecommunications, media, energy, manufacturing and transportation organizations. Generally, our sales force targets its efforts to organizations with over 2,000 employees and $2 billion in annual revenue. As of December 31, 2017, 29% of our commercial customers were Global 2000 organizations and included 44 Fortune 500 companies. Revenue from government agencies represented 15.4%, 26.2% and 32.7% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No single end-customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and marketing expense increased $15.8 million, or 41.3%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $9.8 million increase in sales and marketing personnel costs, a $3.3 million increase in facility and overhead costs, and $2.3 million increase in marketing costs. Personnel costs increased due to the increase in sales and marketing personnel headcount by 46.0% from the end of 2015 to the end of 2016 and increased sales commissions driven by our revenue growth. Facility and overhead costs increased to support our personnel growth. Marketing costs increased due to a rise in marketing event sponsorship and attendance.\n\nSubscriptions, Software and Support\ncategories. We grew from 719 employees at December 31, 2016 to 859 employees at December 31, 2017, and we expect to continue to hire new employees in order to support our anticipated revenue growth.\nWith our platform, organizations can rapidly and easily design, build and implement powerful, enterprise-grade custom applications through our intuitive, visual interface with little or no coding required. Our customers have used applications built on our low-code platform to launch new business lines, automate vital employee workflows, manage complex trading platforms, accelerate drug development and build global procurement systems. With our platform, decision makers can reimagine their products, services, processes and customer interactions by removing much of the complexity and many of the challenges associated with traditional approaches to software development.\n(1) Includes stock-based compensation expense below. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, no\nWe expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from quarter to quarter and year to year for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations.\nSince inception, we have invested in our professional services organization to help ensure that customers are able to build and deploy applications on our platform. We have several strategic partnerships, including with Deloitte, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers for them to refer customers to us and then to provide professional services directly to the customers using our platform. We intend to further grow our base of strategic partners to provide broader customer coverage and solution delivery capabilities. In addition, over time we expect professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue to decline as we increasingly rely on strategic partners to help our customers deploy our software. We believe our investment in professional services, including strategic partners building their practices around Appian, will drive increased adoption of our platform.\nCost of Revenue\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe generate revenue primarily through sales of subscriptions to our platform, as well as professional services. We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service or product has been provided to the customer; (3) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection of related fees is reasonably assured. If collection is not reasonably assured, we defer revenue recognition until collectability becomes reasonably assured. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return.\nOur principal uses of cash are funding operations and other working capital requirements. Over the past several years, revenue has increased significantly from year to year and, as a result, cash flows from customer collections have increased. However, operating expenses have also increased as we have invested in growing our business. Our operating cash requirements may increase in the future as we continue to invest in the strategic growth of our company.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nResearch and development expense increased $6.2 million, or 37.3%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $4.7 million increase in research and development personnel costs and a $1.4 million increase in facility and overhead costs. Personnel costs increased due to the increase in research and development personnel headcount by 41.7% from the end of 2015 to the end of 2016. Facility and overhead costs increased to support our personnel growth.\nKey Components of Results of Operations\n\n\nOur multiple element arrangements are from SaaS subscriptions and term license subscriptions that are generally sold in combination with maintenance and support service and frequently with professional services.\nOur Business Model\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nRevenue\nHistorically, we licensed our software primarily under perpetual licenses, but over time we transitioned from perpetual licenses to subscriptions. As a result, revenue from our perpetual software licenses was less than 1.0% of our total revenue for 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 1.9% of our total revenue in 2015.\nThe fair value of RSUs is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant.\nFor multiple element arrangements involving term license subscriptions, maintenance and support and professional services, we do not have VSOE of fair value for the maintenance and support. Our term license subscriptions are generally not sold on a standalone basis, and therefore, we have not established VSOE of fair value for the subscriptions. Consequently, for our bundled arrangements that include certain professional services, there are two undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established and, therefore, we utilize the combined services approach and defer all revenue until the software has been delivered and the provision of all services has commenced. We then recognize the entire fee from the arrangement ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement, assuming all other software revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nSubscriptions, Software and Support\nAt the same time, we believe that the costs we incur to retain customers and drive additional purchases of software are lower than our customer acquisition costs on a relative basis. Over time, we expect a large portion of our customers to renew their subscriptions and purchase additional subscriptions as they continue to build more applications and add more users to our platform. Over the last three completed fiscal years, we had an average subscription renewal rate of 95%. We calculate our subscription renewal rate by dividing (i) the subscription revenue from renewing customers in the current 12-month period that were customers during the entirety of the prior 12-month period, giving effect to price increases but excluding additional subscriptions for additional users, or upsells, by (ii) our subscription revenue from all customers in the corresponding prior 12-month period that were customers during the entirety of such prior 12-month period. For example, to obtain our subscription renewal rate for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2017, we identified the amount of subscription revenue in 2017 from customers that were our customers for all of 2016, and subtracted the amount of upsells to such customers in 2017. We then divided the balance of 2017 subscription revenue from such customers by all subscription revenue generated in 2016 from customers that were customers for the entirety of 2016. With respect to the average for our last three completed fiscal years, we calculated the average of the three applicable 12-month periods. We also expect the proportion of annual revenue from existing customers to grow relative to annual revenue from new customers. We believe this mix shift over time will have a positive impact on our operating margins, as we expect the percentage of revenue spent on sales and marketing to decline.\n \u2022 Growth of Our Customer Base. We believe we have a substantial opportunity to grow our customer base. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription or maintenance and support contract related to a perpetual software license as of the specified measurement date. To the extent we contract with one or more entities under common control, we count those entities as separate customers. We have aggressively invested, and intend to continue to invest, in our sales force in order to drive sales to new customers. In particular, we have recently made, and plan to continue to make, investments to enhance the expertise of our sales and marketing organization within our key industry verticals of financial services, healthcare and government. In addition, we have established relationships with strategic partners who work with organizations undergoing digital transformations. We had a total customer count of 356, 280 and 266 as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which includes customers with active software subscription agreements or with maintenance and support contracts, and our number of customers with active software subscription agreements was 291, 206 and 178 as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, 29% of our commercial customers were Global 2000 organizations and included 44 Fortune 500 companies. Our ability to continue to grow our customer base is dependent, in part, upon our ability to compete within the increasingly competitive markets in which we participate. \nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. The fair value is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award, on a straight-line basis when the only condition to vesting is continued service. For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized using the accelerated attribution method, based on the probability of satisfying the performance condition. For awards that contain market conditions, compensation expense is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model and recognized using the accelerated attribution method over the derived service period based on the expected market performance as of the grant date. We account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimating expected forfeitures.\nGross Margin\nSubscriptions, software and support revenue is primarily derived from:\nThe following table reconciles GAAP net loss per share to non-GAAP net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nAmounts drawn on the senior revolving credit facility bore interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate plus 0.75%. The facility matured in April 2019, contained covenants related to our short-term liquidity and was collateralized by all of our assets.\nIncome Taxes\nResearch and development expense increased $11.8 million, or 51.5%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $11.0 million increase in research and development personnel costs and a $0.9 million increase in facility and overhead costs, offset by a $0.1 million decrease in consulting fees. Personnel costs increased due to $2.8 million in stock-based compensation expense in 2017 and an increase in research and development personnel headcount by 32.4% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017.\nWe have invested in developing our platform, expanding our sales and marketing and research and development capabilities, and providing general and administrative resources to support our growth. We intend to continue to invest in our business to take advantage of our market opportunity. As a result, we incurred net losses of $31.0 million, $12.5 million and $7.0 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also had operating cash flows of $(9.1) million, $(7.8) million and $(2.1) million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nwas partially offset by a $9.7 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of billings, a $4.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets and a $3.5 million increase in deferred commissions due to increased sales.\nJOBS Act Transition Period\n \u2022 Investments in Growth. We have made and plan to continue to make investments for long-term growth, including investment in our platform and infrastructure to continuously maximize the power and simplicity of the platform to meet the evolving needs of our customers and to take advantage of our market opportunity. We intend to continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing, as we further expand our sales teams, increase our marketing activities and grow our international operations. We expect to use a portion of the proceeds from our IPO to fund these growth strategies. \nSeasonality\n \u2022 Mix of Subscription and Professional Services Revenue. We believe our professional services have driven customer success and facilitated the adoption of our platform by customers. During the initial period of deployment by a customer, we generally provide a greater amount of support in building applications and training than later in the deployment, with a typical engagement extending from two to six months. At the same time, many of our customers have historically purchased subscriptions only for a limited set of their total potential end users. As a result of these factors, the proportion of total revenue for a customer associated with professional services is relatively high during the initial deployment period. Over time, as the need for professional services associated with user deployments decreases and the number of end users increases, we expect the mix of total revenue to shift more toward subscription revenue. In addition, we intend to further grow our base of strategic partners to provide broader customer coverage and solution delivery capabilities. These partners perform professional services with respect to any new service contracts they sign. As we expand the network of strategic partners, we expect the proportion of our total revenue from subscriptions to increase over time relative to professional services. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, 51.8%, 52.6% and 47.8% of our revenue, respectively, was derived from sales of subscriptions, software and support, while the remaining 48.2%, 47.4% and 52.2%, respectively, was derived from the sale of professional services. \nrequired from outside sources, we may be unable to raise the funds on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent existing cash and cash equivalents and investments and cash from operations are not sufficient to fund future activities, we may need to raise additional funds. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness may have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict operations. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Although we are not currently a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies, we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek additional equity financing, incur indebtedness, or use cash resources. We have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any such acquisitions. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRecent Developments\nSaaS Subscriptions\n\nIn November 2017, we completed a secondary offering pursuant to which stockholders sold an aggregate of 4,370,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $20.25 per share, including 570,000 shares pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional Class A shares. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of our Class A common stock offered in the secondary offering.\nIn November 2017, we entered into a $20.0 million revolving line of credit with a lender. The facility matures in November 2022. We may elect whether amounts drawn on the revolving line of credit bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to either the LIBOR or the prime rate plus an additional interest rate margin that is determined by the availability of borrowings under the revolving line of credit. The additional interest rate margin will range from 2.00% to 2.50% in the case of LIBOR advances and from 1.00% to 1.50% in the case of prime rate advances. The revolving line of credit contains an unused facility fee in an amount between 0.15% and 0.25% of the average unused portion of the revolving line of credit, which is payable quarterly. The agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and requires us to maintain (i) an adjusted quick ratio of at least 1.35 to 1.0 and (ii) minimum adjusted EBITDA, in the amounts and for the periods set forth in the agreement. Any amounts borrowed under the credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had not made any borrowings under this new revolving line of credit and we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.1 million under the 2017 line of credit in connection with securing our leased office space.\nThe following table reconciles GAAP weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted, to non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nTotal revenue increased $21.7 million, or 19.5%, in 2016 compared to 2015, due to an increase in our subscriptions revenue of $16.8 million and an increase in our professional services revenue of $4.9 million. The increase in subscription revenue was attributable to $11.0 million of revenue from expanded deployments and corresponding sales of additional subscriptions to existing customers and $5.8 million in sales of subscriptions to new customers. The increase in professional services revenue was due to increased application development and deployment assistance demands from our customers.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $10.0 million, consisting of $20.0 million in net borrowings under our term loan, partially offset by $10.0 million in repayments of debt.\nWe have experienced strong revenue growth, with revenue of $176.7 million, $132.9 million and $111.2 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our subscription revenue was $82.8 million, $60.0 million and $41.5 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOur professional services revenue is comprised of fees for consulting services, including application development and deployment assistance and training related to our platform. Our professional services are not essential to the functionality of our platform because the platform is ready for the customer's use immediately upon delivery and is not modified or customized in any manner.\n2015 Term Loan\nInvesting Activities\nSignificant estimates embedded in the consolidated financial statements for the period presented include revenue recognition, stock-based compensation and income taxes.\nOur subscription fees are based primarily on the number of users who access and utilize the applications built on our platform. Our customer contract terms vary from one to five years, with an average length of three years, with most providing for payment in advance on an annual, quarterly or monthly basis. Due to the variability of our billing terms and the episodic nature of our customers purchasing additional subscriptions, we do not believe that changes in our deferred revenue in a given period are directly correlated with our revenue growth.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have uniform definitions and our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of the compensation provided to our employees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with any positive cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our line of credit, will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, particularly internationally, and the introduction of new and enhanced products and functions, platform enhancements and professional services offerings and the level of market acceptance of our applications. In the event that additional financing is\nConsulting services are billed under both time-and-material and fixed-fee arrangements. For standalone time-and-material contracts, we recognize revenue at contractually agreed upon billing rates applied to hours performed. For standalone fixed-fee contracts, we also recognize revenue as the work is performed using the proportional performance method of accounting. Training revenue is recognized when the associated training services are delivered. Training is also sold in the form of a subscription arrangement where a customer agrees to pay an annual fixed fee for a fixed number of users to have access to all of our training offerings during the year. Revenue from training subscription agreements is recognized ratably over the subscription period.\nA key factor to our success is the renewal and expansion of subscription agreements with our existing customers. We calculate this metric over a set of customers who have been with us for at least one full year. To calculate our subscription revenue retention rate for a particular trailing 12-month period, we first establish the recurring subscription revenue for the previous trailing 12-month period. This effectively represents recurring dollars that we should expect in the current trailing 12-month period from the cohort of customers from the previous trailing 12-month period without any expansion or contraction. We subsequently measure the recurring subscription revenue in the current trailing 12-month period from the cohort of customers from the previous trailing 12-month period. Subscription revenue retention rate is then calculated by dividing the aggregate recurring subscription revenue in the current trailing 12-month period by the previous trailing 12-month period. This calculation includes the impact on our revenue from customer non-renewals, pricing changes and growth in the number of users on our platform. Our subscription revenue retention rate can fluctuate from period to period due to large customer contracts in any given period.\n\n\nResearch and Development Expense\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nOur term license subscription revenue is derived from customers with on-premises installations of our platform pursuant to contracts that are generally one to five years in length. Customers with term license subscriptions have the right to use our software and receive maintenance and support. Since we do not sell maintenance and support separately from the subscription, revenue for the term license subscription and maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription, upon delivery of the platform to the customer when sold on a standalone basis.\nSee Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for information related to recently issued accounting standards.\nOur tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority. We measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.\nFinancing Activities\nResearch and Development Expense\n(1) We have annual royalty fees of $0.3 million for a non-cancellable agreement for the use of technology that is integral in\nDeferred Commissions\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities of $7.8 million consisted of a net loss of $12.5 million and $0.2 million in adjustments for non-cash items, partially offset by $4.9 million of cash provided by changes in working capital. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of a provision for deferred income taxes of $1.1 million, partially offset by depreciation and amortization expense of $0.8 million and a fair value adjustment for our warrant liability of $0.2 million. The increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $17.4 million as a result of increased subscription sales and a $3.7 million increase in accrued compensation and related benefits as a result of our increasing headcount. These increases were partially offset by an $11.2 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of billings and a higher level of sales, and a $5.3 million increase in deferred commissions.\nBacklog represents future amounts to be invoiced and recognized under subscription agreements. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had backlog of approximately $214 million and $167 million, respectively. Approximately 58% of our backlog as of December 31, 2017 is not expected to be filled in 2018.\nSubscription Revenue Retention Rate\nthe development of our software. No amounts were included in the \"More than 5 Years\" column as this agreement is perpetual and will be required as long as we continue to use the technology.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities of $9.1 million consisted of a net loss of $31.0 million, offset by $14.4 million in adjustments for non-cash items and $7.5 million of cash provided by changes in working capital. Adjustments for non-cash items consisted of stock-based compensation of $13.0 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $0.9 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.4 million and fair value adjustment for the warrant liability of $0.3 million, offset by a provision for deferred income taxes of $0.2 million. The increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $18.3 million, as a result of increased subscription sales, a $4.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a $2.4 million increase in accrued compensation and related benefits, primarily due to the timing of year-end bonus payments. This increase\n \u2022 Market Adoption of Our Platform. Our ability to grow our customer base and drive market adoption of our platform is affected by the pace at which organizations digitally transform. We expect that our revenue growth will be primarily driven by the pace of adoption and penetration of our platform. We offer a leading custom software development platform and intend to continue to invest to expand our customer base. The degree to which prospective customers \nWe calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make that determination.\nGross profit and gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of total revenue, has been, and will continue to be, affected by various factors, including the mix of subscription, software and support revenue and professional services revenue. Subscription pricing, the costs associated with third-party hosting facilities, and the extent to which we expand our professional services to support future growth will impact our gross margins. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period based on the above factors.\nThe following are several key factors that affect our performance:\nUse of Funds\nWe monitor the following metrics to help us measure and evaluate the effectiveness of our operations (dollars in thousands):\nThe following table reconciles GAAP net loss to non-GAAP net loss for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):", "item_7_text": "Revenue Recognition\n\n\nCost of Revenue\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Salaries, bonuses and other personnel-related costs are the most significant components of each of these expense\nOur maintenance and support agreements provide customers with the right to unspecified software upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the maintenance and support agreement on a when-and-if-available basis, and rights to technical support. When our platform is deployed within a customer's own data center or private cloud, it is installed on the customer's infrastructure and offered as a term or perpetual license. When our platform is delivered as a SaaS subscription, we handle its operational needs in third-party hosted data centers.\nOperating Activities\nWe exclude stock-based compensation expense because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact our non-cash expense. We believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allow for more meaningful comparisons between our operating results from period to period. We exclude the impact of change in the fair value of warrant liability and loss on extinguishment of debt as these costs are unrelated to current operations nor predictive of future results, which we believe allows for a more meaningful comparison between the operating results from period to period. Accordingly, we believe that excluding these expenses provides investors and management with greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business operations, facilitates comparison of our results with other periods and may also provide comparison with the results of other companies in our industry.\nSales and Marketing Expense\nSales and marketing expense primarily includes personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, commissions, stock-based compensation and other personnel costs related to sales teams. Additional expenses in this category include travel and entertainment, marketing and promotional events, marketing activities, subcontracting fees and allocated facility costs and overhead.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nResearch and Development Expense\n\nStock-Based Compensation\nBorrowings under the senior term loan bore interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate plus 1.25%. Borrowings were required to be repaid over 48 months, consisting of 12 months of interest-only payments followed by 36 months of principal and interest payments. We could pay off the entire senior term loan at any time by paying all outstanding principal, accrued interest, and a prepayment fee of 2% of the amount borrowed if repaid through month 12, 1% of the amount borrowed if repaid during months 13 through 24 and no prepayment fee if repaid thereafter. The senior term loan included a financial covenant related to our short-term liquidity and was collateralized by all of our assets.\n\nSaaS Subscriptions\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $4.5 million, or 36.1%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in general and administrative personnel costs, a $1.1 million increase in facility and overhead costs, and $0.9 million in increased professional services costs. Personnel costs increased due to the increase in general and administrative personnel headcount by 32.3% from the end of 2015 to the end of 2016. Facility and overhead costs as well as contractor costs increased to support our personnel growth.\nGross margin increased to 62.3% in 2016 compared to 56.4% in 2015, due primarily to an increase in the gross margin for our professional services. During 2015, we incurred increased contractor costs to support a new customer contract. Professional services gross margin increased in 2016 due to a reduction in our contractor costs of $5.4 million as compared to 2015 as we continued to hire additional internal professional services personnel.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $0.4 million, $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for the purchase of property and equipment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $50.9 million, consisting of $80.2 million in proceeds from our IPO, net of underwriting discounts, $19.6 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of issuance costs and $1.1 million in proceeds received from stock option exercises. These increases were offset by the repayment of $40.0 million of long-term debt, a $7.6 million dividend payment to the Series A preferred stockholders and the payment of deferred IPO costs of $2.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $73.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. On May 31, 2017, we closed our IPO of 7,187,500 shares of our Class A common stock at an offering price of $12.00 per share, including 937,500 shares pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional Class A shares, resulting in net proceeds to us of $77.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.0 million and offering expenses of $2.4 million.\nOur SaaS subscription revenue is derived from customers accessing our cloud offering pursuant to contracts that are generally one to five years in length. We perform all required maintenance and support for our cloud offering and we do not separately charge customers for hosting costs. In these arrangements, our customers do not have the right to take the software on-premises and, as a result, such arrangements are not accounted for within the scope of the software revenue guidance. Revenue from SaaS subscriptions is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription, beginning with the date our service is made available to our customer.\nSubscriptions, Software and Support Revenue\n\nProfessional Services\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\n2017 Financing Facility\n2015 Line of Credit\nKey Metrics\nrecognize the need for low-code software that enables organizations to digitally transform, and subsequently allocate budget dollars to purchase our software, will drive our ability to acquire new customers and increase sales to existing customers, which, in turn, will affect our future financial performance.\nSales and Marketing Expense\nCost of subscriptions, software and support revenue consists primarily of fees paid to our third-party managed hosting providers and other third-party service providers, personnel costs, including payroll and benefits for our technology operations and customer support teams, and allocated facility costs and overhead. We expect cost of revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as our customer base grows.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the use of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option, the current price of the underlying stock, the expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option. The expected term represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding. Due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected term of the stock options, we use the simplified method to estimate the expected term for its stock options. Under the simplified method, the expected term of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities for publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected term of the stock options. We assume no dividend yield because dividends on our common stock are not expected to be paid in the near future, which is consistent with our history of not paying dividends on our common stock.\nOur business model focuses on maximizing the lifetime value of customer relationships, which is a function of the duration of a customer's deployment of Appian as well as the price and number of subscriptions of Appian that a customer purchases. The costs we incur with respect to any customer may exceed revenue from that customer in earlier periods because we generally recognize costs associated with customer acquisition faster than we generate and recognize the associated revenue. We incur significant customer acquisition costs, including expenses associated with hiring new sales representatives, who generally take more than one year to become productive given the length of our sales cycle, and marketing costs, all of which are expensed as incurred. Our customer contract terms vary from one to five years, with an average length of three years, with most providing for payment in advance on an annual, quarterly or monthly basis, and we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the subscription period.\nSubscriptions, software and support revenue is primarily related to (1) SaaS subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services and (2) term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support. To a lesser extent, we also generate revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses and associated maintenance and support.\nRevenue\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nWe often sign multiple-year subscription agreements, the length in years of which may vary widely. Backlog may vary based on changes in the average non-cancellable term of subscription agreements. The change in backlog that results from changes in the average non-cancellable term of subscription agreements may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or expected future revenue. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not a reliable indicator of future revenue, and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nSubscriptions, Software and Support Gross Margin. Subscriptions, software and support gross margin is primarily affected by the growth in our subscriptions, software and support revenue as compared to the growth in, and timing of, costs to support such revenue. We expect to continue to invest in the customer support and SaaS operations to support the growth in the business and the timing of those investments is expected to cause gross margins to fluctuate in the short term but improve over time.\nOur platform is designed to be natively multi-lingual to facilitate collaboration and address challenges in multi-national organizations. We offer our platform globally. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, 27.0%, 19.5% and 19.9%, respectively, of our total revenue was generated from customers outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2017, we operated in 11 countries. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to grow our international footprint. We are investing in new geographies, including through investment in direct and indirect sales channels, professional services and customer support and implementation partners.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. We therefore believe that we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those under Risk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTotal revenue increased $43.8 million, or 33.0%, in 2017 compared to 2016, due to an increase in our professional services revenue of $22.3 million and an increase in our subscriptions, software and support revenue of $21.5 million. The increase in professional services revenue was due to $9.3 million of additional revenue from existing customers and $13.0 million in sales to new customers. The increase in subscription revenue was attributable to $17.1 million of revenue from expanded deployments and corresponding sales of additional subscriptions to existing customers and $4.4 million in sales of subscriptions to new customers.\nOur research and development efforts are focused on enhancing the speed and power of our software platform. The number of employees in research and development functions grew from 145 at December 31, 2016 to 192 at December 31, 2017. We expect research and development expenses to continue to increase as they are critical to maintain and improve our quality of applications and our competitive position.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data:\nBorrowings under the subordinated term loan bore interest at an initial rate of 11%, which increased by 1% upon each anniversary of the closing date of the financing facility. The facility matured in April 2020. Interest-only payments were required through maturity, and the principal balance was due upon maturity. We were able to borrow amounts under the subordinated term loan within the first 12 months after closing. We could pay off the entire subordinated term loan at any time by paying all outstanding principal, accrued interest, and a final payment fee of 5% of the amount borrowed if repaid through month 12, 6% of the amount borrowed if repaid during months 13 through 24 and 7% of the amount borrowed if repaid thereafter. The subordinated term loan also carried an unused facility fee of 1.5% of the unused portion of the subordinated term loan, which was payable quarterly. The subordinated term loan included a financial covenant related to our recurring revenue and was collateralized by all of our assets.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and other personnel costs for our administrative, legal, information technology, human resources, finance and accounting employees and executives. Additional expenses included in this category are non-personnel costs, such as travel-related expenses, contracting and professional fees, audit fees, tax services and legal fees, as well as insurance and other corporate expenses, along with allocated facility costs and overhead.\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted, substantially changing the U.S. federal tax system. Notable provisions of the TCJA include the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, the imposition of a one-time transition tax on unremitted cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and the implementation of a territorial tax system. While the changes from the TCJA are generally effective beginning in 2018, U.S. GAAP accounting for income taxes requires the effect of a change in tax laws or rates to be recognized in income from continuing operations for the period that includes the enactment date. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the TCJA, SAB No. 118 allows us to record provisional amounts in earnings for the year ending December 31, 2017. Where reasonable estimates can be made, the provisional accounting should be based on such estimates. When no reasonable estimate can be made, the provisional accounting may be based on the tax law in effect before the TCJA. We are required to complete our tax accounting for the TCJA in the period when it has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information to complete the income tax accounting.\nThe following table sets forth our non-GAAP net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands except share and per share data):\nare deferred and amortized over the terms of the related customer contracts consistent with the related revenue. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had total deferred commissions of $21.5 million and $18.0 million, respectively. Commission expense was $11.8 million, $6.5 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nSales and Marketing Expense\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nWe measure the effectiveness of our business model by comparing the lifetime value of our customer relationships to our customer acquisition costs. We calculate lifetime customer value as (1) average gross margin multiplied by average subscription and maintenance and support revenue from customers for a given month divided by (2) the average percentage of monthly recurring revenue that did not renew in each month for the previous 12 months. We then divide this calculated lifetime customer value by our customer acquisition cost, which is the total sales and marketing expense incurred during the corresponding month. On a rolling twelve month basis, we estimate that for each of 2017, 2016 and 2015 the average lifetime value of a customer has exceeded 7x the associated average cost of acquiring them.\nIn 2016 and 2017, we have generated the majority of our revenue from sales of subscriptions, software and support, which include (1) SaaS subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services, and (2) term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support. To a lesser extent, we also generate revenue from the sale of perpetual software license agreements and associated maintenance and support agreements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $10.0 million, consisting of $10.0 million in net borrowings under our term loan.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe number of employees in general and administrative functions grew from 86 at December 31, 2016 to 98 at December 31, 2017. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support our growth and as a result of our becoming a public company.\nThe following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nWe defer recognition of revenue from work performed on pending contract modifications until the period in which the modifications are accepted and funding is approved by the customer. Costs of work performed on pending contract modifications are expensed as incurred.\nProfessional Services Gross Margin. Professional services gross margin is affected by the growth in our professional services revenue as compared to the growth in, and timing of, the cost of our professional services organization as we continue to invest in the growth of our business. Professional services gross margin is also impacted by the ratable recognition of some of our professional services revenue as compared to the recognition of related costs of services in the period incurred, as well as the amount of services performed by subcontractors as opposed to internal resources.\nDeferred commissions are the incremental costs that are directly associated with subscription agreements with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to our direct sales force. Commissions are considered direct and incremental and as such\nIn April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards and to adopt certain of the reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. As a result of the accounting standards election, we will not be subject to the same implementation timing for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult.\nGross margin increased to 63.5% in 2017 compared to 62.3% in 2016 due to an increase in the gross margin of our subscriptions, software and support revenue as well as our professional services revenue. Our revenue mix remained relatively constant in 2017 compared to 2016. The gross margin of our professional services revenue in 2016 was negatively impacted by temporarily low utilization of professional services resources as they were being redeployed after the completion of a large engagement in the prior quarter.\n\n\nstock-based compensation expense was recognized for our stock option awards because a qualifying event had not yet occurred.\n\nInterest on the term loan borrowings accrued at a floating rate equal to the prime rate plus 1.25%. Initially, the first 12 months were to require interest-only payments followed by 36 months of monthly amortization payments. In contemplation of the new financing facility described below, the interest-only period was extended until the new financing facility was finalized. We were permitted to pay off the entire term loan at any time by paying all outstanding principal, accrued interest, and a prepayment fee of 1% of the amount advanced through month 12, 0.5% during months 13 through 24 and no prepayment fee thereafter. The term loan included a financial covenant related to our short-term liquidity.\nWe have financed our operations in large part with equity and debt financing arrangements, including net proceeds of $10.0 million from the sale of shares of preferred stock over a period of several years prior to our IPO and the net proceeds from our IPO, as well as through sales of software and professional services and borrowings under our credit facilities.\nRevenue\nAt December 31, 2015, we had a $10.0 million revolving line of credit with a lender, expiring in June 2016, which was subsequently amended in June 2016 to extend the maturity date through June 2017, and which was terminated in April 2017. The amount of borrowing available under the credit facility at any time could not exceed 80% of eligible accounts receivable at such time and any amounts borrowed were collateralized by substantially all of our assets. Amounts drawn on the revolving line of credit accrued interest at a floating rate of prime plus 0.75%. The agreement contained certain affirmative covenants related to the timely delivery of financial information to the lender and maintaining a liquidity ratio of at least 1.25 to 1, as well as certain customary negative covenants.\nSubscription Revenue\nTerm License Subscriptions\n \u2022 SaaS subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services; and \nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenue:\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $10.1 million, or 59.3%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $7.1 million increase in general and administrative personnel costs, a $1.1 million increase in professional fees, a $1.0 million increase in facility and overhead costs and a $0.9 million increase in legal costs. Personnel costs increased due to $5.1 million in stock-based compensation expense in 2017 and an increase in general and administrative personnel headcount by 14.0% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 in order to support the additional requirements of being a public company. Professional fees increased due to use of consulting services to assist with the implementation of new software to support our back-office functions as well as costs incurred during the secondary offering in November 2017. Facility and overhead costs increased to support our personnel growth. Legal costs increased due to costs incurred during the secondary offering as well as the settlement of certain legal matters.\nTerm License Subscriptions\n\nSources of Funds\nWe focus on acquiring new customers and growing our relationships with existing customers over time. The chart below illustrates our history of attracting new customers and expanding our revenue from them over time as they realize the benefits of building applications using our software.\nThe number of employees in sales and marketing functions grew from 238 at December 31, 2016 to 307 at December 31, 2017. In order to continue to grow our business, geographical footprint and brand awareness, we expect to continue investing resources in sales and marketing by increasing the number of sales and account management teams. As a result, we expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest to acquire new customers and further expand usage of our platform within our existing customer base.\nWe generate revenue primarily through sales of subscriptions to our platform, as well as professional services. We generally sell our software on a per-user basis. We generally bill customers and collect payment for subscriptions to our platform in advance on an annual, quarterly or monthly basis. In certain instances, we have had customers pay their entire contract value up front.\nProfessional Services\nCost of professional services revenue includes all direct and indirect costs to deliver our professional services and training, including employee compensation for our global professional services and training personnel, travel costs, third-party contractor costs and allocated facility costs and overhead. The unpredictability of the timing of entering into significant professional services agreements sold on a standalone basis may cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results.\nCost of revenue increased $1.6 million, or 3.4%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $5.8 million increase in professional services and product support staff personnel costs and a $1.2 million increase in facility and overhead costs, offset by decreases in contractor costs of $5.4 million. Personnel costs increased due to the increase in professional services and customer support staff personnel headcount by 4.6% from the end of 2015 to the end of 2016. Facility and overhead costs increased to support our personnel growth. Contractor costs decreased from 2015 to 2016 as we incurred additional contractor costs in 2015 to support a new customer contract.\nWe have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the TCJA; however, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects of the TCJA on our financial statements which are included as a component of income tax expense.\nWe believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our other significant accounting policies. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those financial statements and accompanying notes. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\nCustomer Cohort Analysis\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nBacklog\nResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our employees who develop and enhance our platform, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and other personnel costs. Also included are non personnel costs such as subcontracting, consulting and professional fees to third party development resources, allocated facility costs, overhead and depreciation and amortization costs.\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, we provide investors with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding, which we collectively refer to as non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude all or a combination of the following (as reflected in the following reconciliation tables): stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of warrant liability and loss on extinguishment of debt. We define non-GAAP operating loss as operating loss before stock-based compensation expense. We define non-GAAP net loss as net loss before stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of warrant liability and loss on extinguishment of debt. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past\nIn March 2015, we entered into a collateralized $10.0 million term loan facility with a lender, maturing in March 2019 and borrowed the full amount under the term loan facility in June 2015. In January 2016, we paid off the outstanding balance of the term loan and simultaneously entered into a $20.0 million term loan facility with the lender, maturing in January 2020. We borrowed the full amount under the term loan facility in January 2016, which we repaid in full in April 2017.\n \u2022 on-premises term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support.  To a lesser extent, we also generate revenue from the sale of perpetual software license agreements and associated maintenance and support.\n \u2022 Further Penetration of Existing Customers. Our sales force seeks to generate additional revenue from existing customers by adding new users to our platform. Many of our customers begin by building a single application and then grow to build dozens of applications on our platform. Generally, the development of new applications on our platform results in the expansion of our user base within an organization and a corresponding increase in revenue to us because we charge subscription fees on a per-user basis for the significant majority of our customer contracts. As a result of this land and expand\u201d strategy, we have generated significant additional revenue from our customer base. Our ability to increase sales to existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including the size of our sales force and professional services teams, customers' level of satisfaction with our platform and professional services, pricing, economic conditions and our customers' overall spending levels. \n\nWe provide a leading low-code software development platform as a service that enables organizations to rapidly develop powerful and unique applications. The applications created on our platform help companies drive digital transformation and competitive differentiation.\nProfessional Services\nFollowing our IPO, we established a policy of using the closing sale price per share of our Class A common stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant for purposes of determining the exercise price per share of our options to purchase common stock.\nResults of Operations\n\nThe chart reflects annualized subscription revenue for the group of customers that became our customers in each respective cohort year. For instance, the 2014 cohort includes all customers whose contract start date was between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014. Annualized subscription revenue is the total amount of daily subscription revenue for that applicable customer cohort in January of the following year multiplied by 365. We use January revenue data for the cohort of customers who first signed subscription agreements in the preceding year because January is the first month in which we are earning a full month of revenue from all such customers. Building upon this success, we believe a significant opportunity exists for us to acquire new customers as well as expand the use of our platform by increasing the number of users within our current customers' organizations.\nIn April 2017, we entered into a new financing facility consisting of a $5.0 million senior revolving credit facility, a $20.0 million senior term loan and a $10.0 million subordinated term loan. In connection with the execution of this financing facility, the prior line of credit was terminated, and we borrowed the full $20.0 million available under the senior term loan and repaid the outstanding balance under our prior term loan. Additionally, in connection with the execution of our new financing facility, the lender waived the prepayment fee associated with our prior line of credit.\nMultiple Element Arrangements\nOverview\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2017, we used proceeds from our IPO to pay all remaining outstanding principal and interest under the senior term loan and subsequently terminated the senior term loan and subordinated term loan. This financing facility was terminated in November 2017 in connection with our entry into a new $20.0 million revolving line of credit.\nfinancial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision making. While our non-GAAP financial measures are an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time, you should review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nOur revenue is comprised of the following:\nThe commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. The table does not include obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty. As of December 31, 2017, we had not made any borrowings under our $20.0 million revolving line of credit.\nWe generally sell our software on a per-user basis. We bill customers and collect payment for subscriptions to our platform in advance on an annual, quarterly or monthly basis. In certain instances, we have had customers pay their entire contract up front.\nSubscription revenue is a portion of our revenue contained in the subscriptions, software and support revenue line of our consolidated statements of operations, and includes (1) software as a service, or SaaS, subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services, and (2) term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support. As we generally sell our software on a per-user basis, our subscription revenue for any customer is primarily determined by the number of users who access and utilize the applications built on our platform, as well as the price paid. We believe that increasing our subscription revenue is an indicator of the demand for our platform, the pace at which the market for our solutions is growing, the productivity of our sales force and strategic relationships in growing our customer base, and our ability to further penetrate our existing customer base.\n2017 Line of Credit\nThe following table reconciles GAAP operating loss to non-GAAP operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nSales and marketing expense increased $27.8 million, or 51.4%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $21.2 million increase in sales and marketing personnel costs, a $3.5 million increase in facility and overhead costs, a $2.8 million increase in marketing costs and a $0.3 million increase in professional fees. Personnel costs increased due to $3.2 million in stock-based compensation expense in 2017, an increase in sales and marketing personnel headcount by 29.0% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, and increased sales commissions driven by our revenue growth. Facility and overhead costs increased to support our personnel growth. Marketing costs increased due to a rise in marketing event sponsorship and attendance. Professional fees increased due to an increase in consulting fees.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in operating activities of $2.1 million consisted of a net loss of $7.0 million, partially offset by $4.1 million of cash provided by changes in working capital and $0.8 million in adjustments for non-cash items. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expense of $0.8 million and a fair value adjustment for our warrant liability of $0.3 million, partially offset by a provision for deferred income taxes of $0.3 million. The increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $15.5 million as a result of increased subscription sales, partially offset by a $6.6 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of billings and a higher level of sales, and a $4.0 million increase in deferred commissions.\nCost of Revenue\nPrior to our IPO in May 2017, we were a private company with no active public market for our common stock. Therefore, in response to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, related regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service and accounting standards related to stock-based compensation, we periodically determined for financial reporting purposes the estimated per share fair value of our common stock at various dates using contemporaneous valuations performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.\u201d\nCost of revenue increased $14.5 million, or 28.9%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $6.0 million increase in contractor costs, a $5.3 million increase in professional services and product support staff personnel costs, a $2.6 million increase in billable expenses and a $0.7 million increase in other cost of revenue, offset by a $0.1 million decrease in facility and overhead costs. Contractor costs increased in 2017 compared to 2016 because of an increase in the usage of third-party resources for professional service engagements. Personnel costs increased due to $1.9 million in stock-based compensation expense and an increase in the number of experienced professional services employees in 2017. Billable expenses increased because we had more professional services engagements in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in other cost of revenue is due to increased hosting costs as sales of our cloud offering increased in 2017. The decrease in facility and overhead costs was due to decreased rent expense.\n\nFor multiple element arrangements involving SaaS subscriptions that include professional services in addition to the subscription to our platform, we evaluate each element to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. Because there are third-party vendors who routinely sell and provide the same professional services to our customers, our professional services are deemed to have standalone value apart from the SaaS subscription. Additionally, we offer both SaaS subscriptions and professional services on a standalone basis. Professional services revenue is therefore accounted for separately from subscription fees and recognized as the professional services are performed. We allocate revenue to the elements based on the selling price hierarchy using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price, or if neither exists, best estimated selling price, or BESP. In cases where we do not have VSOE or TPE of the elements of our arrangements, we use BESP to allocate revenue. We determine BESP for a service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, evaluating the weighted average of actual sales prices and other factors such as gross margin objectives, pricing practices and growth strategy. Pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Once the revenue is allocated to these elements, revenue is recognized as such services are provided.\nOur professional services revenue is comprised of fees for consulting services, including application development and deployment assistance and training related to our platform. Over time, as the need for professional services associated with user deployments decreases and the number of end users increases, we expect the mix of total revenue to shift more toward subscription revenue. We have several strategic partnerships, including with Deloitte, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Our agreements with our strategic partners have indefinite terms and may be terminated for convenience by either party. We intend to further grow our base of strategic partners to provide broader customer coverage and solution delivery capabilities. These partners refer software subscription customers to us and perform professional services with respect to any new service contracts they originate, increasing our software subscription revenue without any change to our professional services revenue. As we expand the network of strategic partners, we expect professional services revenue to decline as a percentage of total revenue over time since our strategic partners may perform professional services associated with software subscriptions that we sell.\nWe have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into agreements with customers. We typically enter into a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter. The increase in customer agreements for the fourth quarter is attributable to large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry. Furthermore, we usually enter into a significant portion of agreements with customers during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. However, we recognize substantially all of our revenue ratably over the terms of our subscription agreements, which generally occurs over a one to five-year period. As a result, a substantial portion of the revenue that we report in each period will be derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements entered into during previous periods. Consequently, a decline in new sales or renewals in any one period may not be immediately reflected in our revenue results for that period. This decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future periods. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our platform and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had 356 customers in a wide variety of industries, of which 285 customers were commercial and 71 customers were government or non-commercial entities. Our customers include financial services, healthcare, government, telecommunications, media, energy, manufacturing and transportation organizations. Generally, our sales force targets its efforts to organizations with over 2,000 employees and $2 billion in annual revenue. As of December 31, 2017, 29% of our commercial customers were Global 2000 organizations and included 44 Fortune 500 companies. Revenue from government agencies represented 15.4%, 26.2% and 32.7% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No single end-customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and marketing expense increased $15.8 million, or 41.3%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $9.8 million increase in sales and marketing personnel costs, a $3.3 million increase in facility and overhead costs, and $2.3 million increase in marketing costs. Personnel costs increased due to the increase in sales and marketing personnel headcount by 46.0% from the end of 2015 to the end of 2016 and increased sales commissions driven by our revenue growth. Facility and overhead costs increased to support our personnel growth. Marketing costs increased due to a rise in marketing event sponsorship and attendance.\n\nSubscriptions, Software and Support\ncategories. We grew from 719 employees at December 31, 2016 to 859 employees at December 31, 2017, and we expect to continue to hire new employees in order to support our anticipated revenue growth.\nWith our platform, organizations can rapidly and easily design, build and implement powerful, enterprise-grade custom applications through our intuitive, visual interface with little or no coding required. Our customers have used applications built on our low-code platform to launch new business lines, automate vital employee workflows, manage complex trading platforms, accelerate drug development and build global procurement systems. With our platform, decision makers can reimagine their products, services, processes and customer interactions by removing much of the complexity and many of the challenges associated with traditional approaches to software development.\n(1) Includes stock-based compensation expense below. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, no\nWe expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from quarter to quarter and year to year for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations.\nSince inception, we have invested in our professional services organization to help ensure that customers are able to build and deploy applications on our platform. We have several strategic partnerships, including with Deloitte, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers for them to refer customers to us and then to provide professional services directly to the customers using our platform. We intend to further grow our base of strategic partners to provide broader customer coverage and solution delivery capabilities. In addition, over time we expect professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue to decline as we increasingly rely on strategic partners to help our customers deploy our software. We believe our investment in professional services, including strategic partners building their practices around Appian, will drive increased adoption of our platform.\nCost of Revenue\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe generate revenue primarily through sales of subscriptions to our platform, as well as professional services. We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service or product has been provided to the customer; (3) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection of related fees is reasonably assured. If collection is not reasonably assured, we defer revenue recognition until collectability becomes reasonably assured. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return.\nOur principal uses of cash are funding operations and other working capital requirements. Over the past several years, revenue has increased significantly from year to year and, as a result, cash flows from customer collections have increased. However, operating expenses have also increased as we have invested in growing our business. Our operating cash requirements may increase in the future as we continue to invest in the strategic growth of our company.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nResearch and development expense increased $6.2 million, or 37.3%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $4.7 million increase in research and development personnel costs and a $1.4 million increase in facility and overhead costs. Personnel costs increased due to the increase in research and development personnel headcount by 41.7% from the end of 2015 to the end of 2016. Facility and overhead costs increased to support our personnel growth.\nKey Components of Results of Operations\n\n\nOur multiple element arrangements are from SaaS subscriptions and term license subscriptions that are generally sold in combination with maintenance and support service and frequently with professional services.\nOur Business Model\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nRevenue\nHistorically, we licensed our software primarily under perpetual licenses, but over time we transitioned from perpetual licenses to subscriptions. As a result, revenue from our perpetual software licenses was less than 1.0% of our total revenue for 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 1.9% of our total revenue in 2015.\nThe fair value of RSUs is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant.\nFor multiple element arrangements involving term license subscriptions, maintenance and support and professional services, we do not have VSOE of fair value for the maintenance and support. Our term license subscriptions are generally not sold on a standalone basis, and therefore, we have not established VSOE of fair value for the subscriptions. Consequently, for our bundled arrangements that include certain professional services, there are two undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established and, therefore, we utilize the combined services approach and defer all revenue until the software has been delivered and the provision of all services has commenced. We then recognize the entire fee from the arrangement ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement, assuming all other software revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nSubscriptions, Software and Support\nAt the same time, we believe that the costs we incur to retain customers and drive additional purchases of software are lower than our customer acquisition costs on a relative basis. Over time, we expect a large portion of our customers to renew their subscriptions and purchase additional subscriptions as they continue to build more applications and add more users to our platform. Over the last three completed fiscal years, we had an average subscription renewal rate of 95%. We calculate our subscription renewal rate by dividing (i) the subscription revenue from renewing customers in the current 12-month period that were customers during the entirety of the prior 12-month period, giving effect to price increases but excluding additional subscriptions for additional users, or upsells, by (ii) our subscription revenue from all customers in the corresponding prior 12-month period that were customers during the entirety of such prior 12-month period. For example, to obtain our subscription renewal rate for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2017, we identified the amount of subscription revenue in 2017 from customers that were our customers for all of 2016, and subtracted the amount of upsells to such customers in 2017. We then divided the balance of 2017 subscription revenue from such customers by all subscription revenue generated in 2016 from customers that were customers for the entirety of 2016. With respect to the average for our last three completed fiscal years, we calculated the average of the three applicable 12-month periods. We also expect the proportion of annual revenue from existing customers to grow relative to annual revenue from new customers. We believe this mix shift over time will have a positive impact on our operating margins, as we expect the percentage of revenue spent on sales and marketing to decline.\n \u2022 Growth of Our Customer Base. We believe we have a substantial opportunity to grow our customer base. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription or maintenance and support contract related to a perpetual software license as of the specified measurement date. To the extent we contract with one or more entities under common control, we count those entities as separate customers. We have aggressively invested, and intend to continue to invest, in our sales force in order to drive sales to new customers. In particular, we have recently made, and plan to continue to make, investments to enhance the expertise of our sales and marketing organization within our key industry verticals of financial services, healthcare and government. In addition, we have established relationships with strategic partners who work with organizations undergoing digital transformations. We had a total customer count of 356, 280 and 266 as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which includes customers with active software subscription agreements or with maintenance and support contracts, and our number of customers with active software subscription agreements was 291, 206 and 178 as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, 29% of our commercial customers were Global 2000 organizations and included 44 Fortune 500 companies. Our ability to continue to grow our customer base is dependent, in part, upon our ability to compete within the increasingly competitive markets in which we participate. \nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. The fair value is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award, on a straight-line basis when the only condition to vesting is continued service. For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized using the accelerated attribution method, based on the probability of satisfying the performance condition. For awards that contain market conditions, compensation expense is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model and recognized using the accelerated attribution method over the derived service period based on the expected market performance as of the grant date. We account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimating expected forfeitures.\nGross Margin\nSubscriptions, software and support revenue is primarily derived from:\nThe following table reconciles GAAP net loss per share to non-GAAP net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nAmounts drawn on the senior revolving credit facility bore interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate plus 0.75%. The facility matured in April 2019, contained covenants related to our short-term liquidity and was collateralized by all of our assets.\nIncome Taxes\nResearch and development expense increased $11.8 million, or 51.5%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $11.0 million increase in research and development personnel costs and a $0.9 million increase in facility and overhead costs, offset by a $0.1 million decrease in consulting fees. Personnel costs increased due to $2.8 million in stock-based compensation expense in 2017 and an increase in research and development personnel headcount by 32.4% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017.\nWe have invested in developing our platform, expanding our sales and marketing and research and development capabilities, and providing general and administrative resources to support our growth. We intend to continue to invest in our business to take advantage of our market opportunity. As a result, we incurred net losses of $31.0 million, $12.5 million and $7.0 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also had operating cash flows of $(9.1) million, $(7.8) million and $(2.1) million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nwas partially offset by a $9.7 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of billings, a $4.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets and a $3.5 million increase in deferred commissions due to increased sales.\nJOBS Act Transition Period\n \u2022 Investments in Growth. We have made and plan to continue to make investments for long-term growth, including investment in our platform and infrastructure to continuously maximize the power and simplicity of the platform to meet the evolving needs of our customers and to take advantage of our market opportunity. We intend to continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing, as we further expand our sales teams, increase our marketing activities and grow our international operations. We expect to use a portion of the proceeds from our IPO to fund these growth strategies. \nSeasonality\n \u2022 Mix of Subscription and Professional Services Revenue. We believe our professional services have driven customer success and facilitated the adoption of our platform by customers. During the initial period of deployment by a customer, we generally provide a greater amount of support in building applications and training than later in the deployment, with a typical engagement extending from two to six months. At the same time, many of our customers have historically purchased subscriptions only for a limited set of their total potential end users. As a result of these factors, the proportion of total revenue for a customer associated with professional services is relatively high during the initial deployment period. Over time, as the need for professional services associated with user deployments decreases and the number of end users increases, we expect the mix of total revenue to shift more toward subscription revenue. In addition, we intend to further grow our base of strategic partners to provide broader customer coverage and solution delivery capabilities. These partners perform professional services with respect to any new service contracts they sign. As we expand the network of strategic partners, we expect the proportion of our total revenue from subscriptions to increase over time relative to professional services. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, 51.8%, 52.6% and 47.8% of our revenue, respectively, was derived from sales of subscriptions, software and support, while the remaining 48.2%, 47.4% and 52.2%, respectively, was derived from the sale of professional services. \nrequired from outside sources, we may be unable to raise the funds on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent existing cash and cash equivalents and investments and cash from operations are not sufficient to fund future activities, we may need to raise additional funds. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness may have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict operations. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Although we are not currently a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies, we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek additional equity financing, incur indebtedness, or use cash resources. We have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any such acquisitions. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRecent Developments\nSaaS Subscriptions\n\nIn November 2017, we completed a secondary offering pursuant to which stockholders sold an aggregate of 4,370,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $20.25 per share, including 570,000 shares pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional Class A shares. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of our Class A common stock offered in the secondary offering.\nIn November 2017, we entered into a $20.0 million revolving line of credit with a lender. The facility matures in November 2022. We may elect whether amounts drawn on the revolving line of credit bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to either the LIBOR or the prime rate plus an additional interest rate margin that is determined by the availability of borrowings under the revolving line of credit. The additional interest rate margin will range from 2.00% to 2.50% in the case of LIBOR advances and from 1.00% to 1.50% in the case of prime rate advances. The revolving line of credit contains an unused facility fee in an amount between 0.15% and 0.25% of the average unused portion of the revolving line of credit, which is payable quarterly. The agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and requires us to maintain (i) an adjusted quick ratio of at least 1.35 to 1.0 and (ii) minimum adjusted EBITDA, in the amounts and for the periods set forth in the agreement. Any amounts borrowed under the credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had not made any borrowings under this new revolving line of credit and we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.1 million under the 2017 line of credit in connection with securing our leased office space.\nThe following table reconciles GAAP weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted, to non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nTotal revenue increased $21.7 million, or 19.5%, in 2016 compared to 2015, due to an increase in our subscriptions revenue of $16.8 million and an increase in our professional services revenue of $4.9 million. The increase in subscription revenue was attributable to $11.0 million of revenue from expanded deployments and corresponding sales of additional subscriptions to existing customers and $5.8 million in sales of subscriptions to new customers. The increase in professional services revenue was due to increased application development and deployment assistance demands from our customers.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $10.0 million, consisting of $20.0 million in net borrowings under our term loan, partially offset by $10.0 million in repayments of debt.\nWe have experienced strong revenue growth, with revenue of $176.7 million, $132.9 million and $111.2 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our subscription revenue was $82.8 million, $60.0 million and $41.5 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOur professional services revenue is comprised of fees for consulting services, including application development and deployment assistance and training related to our platform. Our professional services are not essential to the functionality of our platform because the platform is ready for the customer's use immediately upon delivery and is not modified or customized in any manner.\n2015 Term Loan\nInvesting Activities\nSignificant estimates embedded in the consolidated financial statements for the period presented include revenue recognition, stock-based compensation and income taxes.\nOur subscription fees are based primarily on the number of users who access and utilize the applications built on our platform. Our customer contract terms vary from one to five years, with an average length of three years, with most providing for payment in advance on an annual, quarterly or monthly basis. Due to the variability of our billing terms and the episodic nature of our customers purchasing additional subscriptions, we do not believe that changes in our deferred revenue in a given period are directly correlated with our revenue growth.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have uniform definitions and our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of the compensation provided to our employees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with any positive cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our line of credit, will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, particularly internationally, and the introduction of new and enhanced products and functions, platform enhancements and professional services offerings and the level of market acceptance of our applications. In the event that additional financing is\nConsulting services are billed under both time-and-material and fixed-fee arrangements. For standalone time-and-material contracts, we recognize revenue at contractually agreed upon billing rates applied to hours performed. For standalone fixed-fee contracts, we also recognize revenue as the work is performed using the proportional performance method of accounting. Training revenue is recognized when the associated training services are delivered. Training is also sold in the form of a subscription arrangement where a customer agrees to pay an annual fixed fee for a fixed number of users to have access to all of our training offerings during the year. Revenue from training subscription agreements is recognized ratably over the subscription period.\nA key factor to our success is the renewal and expansion of subscription agreements with our existing customers. We calculate this metric over a set of customers who have been with us for at least one full year. To calculate our subscription revenue retention rate for a particular trailing 12-month period, we first establish the recurring subscription revenue for the previous trailing 12-month period. This effectively represents recurring dollars that we should expect in the current trailing 12-month period from the cohort of customers from the previous trailing 12-month period without any expansion or contraction. We subsequently measure the recurring subscription revenue in the current trailing 12-month period from the cohort of customers from the previous trailing 12-month period. Subscription revenue retention rate is then calculated by dividing the aggregate recurring subscription revenue in the current trailing 12-month period by the previous trailing 12-month period. This calculation includes the impact on our revenue from customer non-renewals, pricing changes and growth in the number of users on our platform. Our subscription revenue retention rate can fluctuate from period to period due to large customer contracts in any given period.\n\n\nResearch and Development Expense\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nOur term license subscription revenue is derived from customers with on-premises installations of our platform pursuant to contracts that are generally one to five years in length. Customers with term license subscriptions have the right to use our software and receive maintenance and support. Since we do not sell maintenance and support separately from the subscription, revenue for the term license subscription and maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription, upon delivery of the platform to the customer when sold on a standalone basis.\nSee Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for information related to recently issued accounting standards.\nOur tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority. We measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.\nFinancing Activities\nResearch and Development Expense\n(1) We have annual royalty fees of $0.3 million for a non-cancellable agreement for the use of technology that is integral in\nDeferred Commissions\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities of $7.8 million consisted of a net loss of $12.5 million and $0.2 million in adjustments for non-cash items, partially offset by $4.9 million of cash provided by changes in working capital. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of a provision for deferred income taxes of $1.1 million, partially offset by depreciation and amortization expense of $0.8 million and a fair value adjustment for our warrant liability of $0.2 million. The increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $17.4 million as a result of increased subscription sales and a $3.7 million increase in accrued compensation and related benefits as a result of our increasing headcount. These increases were partially offset by an $11.2 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of billings and a higher level of sales, and a $5.3 million increase in deferred commissions.\nBacklog represents future amounts to be invoiced and recognized under subscription agreements. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had backlog of approximately $214 million and $167 million, respectively. Approximately 58% of our backlog as of December 31, 2017 is not expected to be filled in 2018.\nSubscription Revenue Retention Rate\nthe development of our software. No amounts were included in the \"More than 5 Years\" column as this agreement is perpetual and will be required as long as we continue to use the technology.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities of $9.1 million consisted of a net loss of $31.0 million, offset by $14.4 million in adjustments for non-cash items and $7.5 million of cash provided by changes in working capital. Adjustments for non-cash items consisted of stock-based compensation of $13.0 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $0.9 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.4 million and fair value adjustment for the warrant liability of $0.3 million, offset by a provision for deferred income taxes of $0.2 million. The increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from changes in working capital primarily consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $18.3 million, as a result of increased subscription sales, a $4.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a $2.4 million increase in accrued compensation and related benefits, primarily due to the timing of year-end bonus payments. This increase\n \u2022 Market Adoption of Our Platform. Our ability to grow our customer base and drive market adoption of our platform is affected by the pace at which organizations digitally transform. We expect that our revenue growth will be primarily driven by the pace of adoption and penetration of our platform. We offer a leading custom software development platform and intend to continue to invest to expand our customer base. The degree to which prospective customers \nWe calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make that determination.\nGross profit and gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of total revenue, has been, and will continue to be, affected by various factors, including the mix of subscription, software and support revenue and professional services revenue. Subscription pricing, the costs associated with third-party hosting facilities, and the extent to which we expand our professional services to support future growth will impact our gross margins. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period based on the above factors.\nThe following are several key factors that affect our performance:\nUse of Funds\nWe monitor the following metrics to
