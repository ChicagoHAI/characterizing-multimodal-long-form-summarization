Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nWe operate a leading digital marketing and communications platform for healthcare marketers seeking to engage and influence consumers and healthcare professionals. We combine premium health and wellness content with sophisticated proprietary data and analytics tools to enable healthcare marketers to communicate with our large audience of consumers and healthcare professionals. During 2015, our customers included five of the top ten global advertisers in 2014, as compiled by Advertising Age, 24 of the top 25 global pharmaceutical companies ranked by 2014 revenue, and more than 350 hospitals across 30 states, including six of the top ten largest health systems in the U.S.\nWe derive a significant majority of our revenues from the sale of digital advertising and sponsorship solutions that engage consumers and healthcare professionals across a variety of health categories. In recent years, we have significantly expanded our advertising and sponsorship market opportunity, diversified our customer base and increased the types of marketing solutions that we offer our customers. We specialize in providing highly-customized, data-driven solutions that can precisely target niche health audiences, and which are designed to be effective on a desktop or mobile device. We believe our customers view our data-driven digital marketing solutions as both superior to traditional media channels, which lack interactivity and the ability to measure and optimize return on investment, or ROI, in real time, and superior to other online media channels, which lack the data or technology to target the desired audience or measure the effectiveness of the campaign.\nTo a lesser extent, we generate revenues from the sale of our premium services, which consist primarily of (i) fees from hospitals for licensing our SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform and (ii) digital subscriptions sold to consumers for access to our consumer diet and fitness properties. In recent years, we have intentionally decreased our focus on generating revenues from consumer subscriptions and this trend will continue in 2016.\nPrior to late 2010, our primary focus was on offering content and tools to consumers and selling marketing solutions targeting only health consumers. In late 2010, we made a strategic decision to expand our business into the market for providing content and marketing solutions targeting healthcare professionals through our acquisition of MedPage Holdings, Inc., or MPT. We believe that the entry into the healthcare professional market provided us with a significant revenue opportunity because pharmaceutical companies spend a larger percentage of their marketing budgets targeting healthcare professionals as compared to consumers.\nIn late 2014, we expanded further into the healthcare professional sector with the acquisition of DoctorDirectory.com, Inc., or DD, a provider of multi-channel marketing solutions for pharmaceutical brands seeking to influence healthcare professionals. The acquisition of DD helped deepen our penetration into the healthcare professional market by significantly increasing our physician audience and enhancing our sophisticated ROI-based marketing solutions that we offer advertisers seeking to engage with healthcare professionals.\nIn March 2015, we expanded our ability to service pharmaceutical companies through the acquisition of Cambridge BioMarketing Group, LLC, or Cambridge, a provider of strategic launch and marketing solutions for orphan and rare disease products. Following this acquisition, we believe that our platform can service our pharmaceutical partners across the entire spectrum of therapeutic areas, including orphan, specialty and mass market brands, as well as provide solutions throughout the entire lifecycle of pharmaceutical marketing, from the strategic phase of pre-launch, during the growth years and beyond the loss of patent exclusivity.\nIn 2014 and 2015, we made the strategic decision to leverage our existing assets to generate revenue from new customer bases across the broader healthcare landscape, particularly payers and providers. Specifically, the goal was to utilize our large, highly-engaged audience, premium content and tools, and advanced data and analytics capabilities to engage and influence consumers and healthcare professionals on behalf of entities such as health insurers and hospitals. In August 2015, we acquired Tea Leaves Health, LLC, or Tea Leaves, a provider of a SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform for hospital systems to identify and engage consumers and physicians. Tea Leaves generates revenues from multi-year contracts with recurring licensing fees, as well as related custom marketing programs that drive incremental advertising revenue. We believe there is a significant revenue opportunity in providing hospital systems with marketing solutions to target both consumers and physicians and to provide measurable ROI for their strategic planning and marketing efforts.\nWe expect our advertising and sponsorship revenues to increase in 2016. We expect our premium services revenue to decrease in 2016, as the increase in hospital SaaS revenue will be offset by the decline in consumer subscription revenues.\nWe also track our revenue performance across consumer, professional and payer/provider as customers may purchase a suite of Everyday Health solutions that incorporate licensing, media and other creative services. For example, with our hospital customers, we generate SaaS revenue from licensing our platform and advertising revenue from implementing marketing programs for the same hospitals. In 2015, our direct to consumer revenue was 63% of total revenue, our direct to professional revenue was 33% of total revenue and our revenue from payers and providers was 4% of total revenue. We expect our direct to professional revenue and revenue from payers and providers to increase as a percentage of our total revenues in 2016 and beyond.\nBackground Information\nKey Trends Affecting Our Business\nWe believe that the following key trends drive our ability to continue to grow our business:\nTable 153: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Marketers are allocating an increasing proportion of their advertising budget to online advertising and are seeking solutions that better target their audience and maximize ROI. We believe that the ability to offer complex data-driven solutions that demonstrate ROI will be a key determinant in our success in attracting marketing dollars in the coming years. We also believe that the online percentage of the total health-related advertising market is still relatively small, and that this percentage will increase in the coming years. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The Internet and mobile devices have become indispensable for both consumers seeking to take a more active role in managing their diverse health and wellness needs and healthcare professionals striving to provide better care for their patients and manage their practices more efficiently. We believe that individuals will increasingly seek out digital content and solutions, and spend more time interacting with these digital channels, to educate themselves, directly manage and monitor their health and wellness, and make a wide array of other health-related purchase decisions, including purchasing health insurance. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The pharmaceutical industry is experiencing a major shift from large mass-market blockbuster\u201d drugs to niche or specialty medications that target discrete patient populations. At the same time, dramatically-reduced sales forces and other restrictions on interacting directly with physicians have made it more difficult for pharmaceutical companies to efficiently market their products and services. As a result, we believe the need for these companies to interact with consumers and physicians more directly through digital channels will increase significantly. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The evolving healthcare environment is forcing many health-related companies to face new challenges and adopt, in many cases for the first time, strategies targeting consumers and healthcare professionals. We believe our large and engaged audience, premium brands and rich database of user information afford us a significant opportunity to grow our revenues as these entities, including health insurance companies, pharmacy benefit management companies and health information technology vendors, seek new ways to drive down costs, acquire new customers and utilize technology to achieve better health outcomes. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nAdvertising and sponsorship revenues constitute a significant majority of our total revenues. We also generate revenues from premium services, which consist primarily of digital subscriptions sold to consumers and fees from hospitals for licensing our SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform.\nGiven the size and scope of our content and audience assets, we offer a variety of advertising and sponsorship solutions that engage consumers and healthcare professionals across a variety of health categories. Our diverse customer base for these marketing solutions consists primarily of pharmaceutical companies, manufacturers and retailers of over-the-counter products and consumer-packaged-goods, and, to a lesser extent, healthcare providers, such as hospital systems, and health insurers. Pharmaceutical companies represent our largest customer group. In addition to offering a wide range of marketing solutions, we also utilize a variety of revenue models depending on the specific needs and profile of the customer. For example, we may price our marketing solutions on (i) a fixed fee basis, (ii) a cost-per-impression (CPM) or cost-per-visitor (CPV) basis, or (iii) the ROI we deliver from a specific campaign. An increasing number of our marketing programs provide for revenues to us based primarily upon the ROI we deliver, such as the increase in prescription activity for a pharmaceutical product.\nMore specifically, our advertising and sponsorship solutions include, among others:\nTable 158: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>display advertisements on our properties and in our free e-mail newsletters, which are primarily sold based on a cost-per-impression advertising model; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>interactive brand sponsorships, which consist of our integrated database marketing programs and sponsorships on our properties, which typically include both components that are sold based on a cost-per-impression basis (in which we are paid based on the number of advertisements we display) and components that are sold based on a cost-per-visitor basis (in which we are paid for delivering a visitor to an advertiser's website), and sometimes include a production fee; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>customer acquisition marketing programs, which are sold based on the number of qualified potential customers that are provided to our advertisers; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>programs that allow marketers the opportunity to target specific audiences outside of our properties using our audience data and analytics; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>marketing programs that provide for revenues based upon the ROI we deliver for our customers, primarily pharmaceutical customers; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>marketing programs that are sold based on a time and materials basis. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough we typically do not distinguish between desktop and mobile channels in the structuring and pricing of our marketing campaigns, mobile channels have become increasingly important in fulfilling these campaigns as overall mobile traffic has increased. Revenues delivered via mobile channels increased 8.1% to $73.1 million in 2015 from $67.7 million in 2014.\nOur premium services revenues include revenues generated from subscriptions sold to individuals who purchase access for a defined period of time to one or more of our properties. Our subscription services are designed to provide the consumer with the ability to access consumer health content from well-recognized sources, and to personalize or customize a specific health or wellness program. Over the last several years, we have intentionally focused more directly on increasing our advertising and sponsorship revenues and less on expanding our consumer subscription revenues. By virtue of our acquisition of Tea Leaves in August 2015, premium services revenues also include fees generated from the license of Tea Leaves' SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform to hospital systems. These licensing agreements are typically multi-year contracts with recurring licensing fees. The related custom marketing programs that are sold to hospital customers that license our SaaS platform are allocated to advertising and sponsorship revenues.\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe timing of our revenues is affected by certain seasonal factors. Our advertising and sponsorship revenues are traditionally the lowest in the first quarter of the year, due primarily to the seasonal spend patterns of our customers, and increases thereafter with the highest advertising and sponsorship revenues in the fourth quarter of the year. As a result of these trends, our gross margin tends to be lowest in the first quarter of each calendar year, typically increasing thereafter. We anticipate that, as our revenues increase, our gross profit will continue to increase while our period-over-period gross margin may not increase commensurately.\nCost of Revenues, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nThe Everyday Health platform provides digital marketing and communications solutions that engage consumers and healthcare professionals across a variety of health categories. Cost of revenues consists primarily of the expenses associated with aggregating the total audience across the Everyday Health properties or delivering an audience to fulfill a marketing campaign. These costs include:\nTable 165: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>media costs; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>royalty payments to our partners; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>to a lesser extent, market research incentives, direct mail marketing and fulfillment costs, as well as costs associated with subscription fees for our premium services, ad serving and other expenses. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMedia costs consist primarily of fees paid to online publishers, Internet search companies and other media channels where we advertise our properties. These media activities are directly attributable to generating revenue, increasing the audience to the properties we operate, accumulating qualified leads, increasing the number of individuals subscribing to our premium services and growing our registered user base. Our partner royalties are generally based on the amount of revenues generated on the particular property. In some cases, we guarantee the partner a minimum annual payment.\nWe carefully monitor our gross profit and gross margin because they are key indicators of our financial performance and success in aggregating and monetizing our audience across the Everyday Health properties. Gross profit is defined as total revenues minus cost of revenues. Gross margin is defined as our gross profit as a percentage of our total revenues. While we focus on the growth of both gross profit and gross margin, we may make investments from time to time that will position us for growth at the expense of gross margin.\nSince our operating decisions are based on aggregating and monetizing our audience as a whole, we believe that our aggregate gross profit is an important measure of our overall performance. Additionally, some of the other costs to operate our properties, such as product development expenses, website hosting and maintenance expenses, are included in operating expenses and not reflected in our cost of revenues. As a result, we also believe that our Adjusted EBITDA is an important metric for measuring our overall financial performance (for a detailed description of Adjusted EBITDA, see Supplemental Financial Information\u201d below).\nBoth our revenues and gross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year periods, as shown in the table below.\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>231,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>184,325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,850 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue growth </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,338 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>165,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>135,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>112,512 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross profit growth </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect our gross profit to continue to improve in the near term as we continue to aggregate our audience more efficiently and enhance our monetization capabilities. While we expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase on an absolute basis in the foreseeable future, we do not believe that any such increases will negatively impact our gross profit or Adjusted EBITDA since we anticipate that the growth in our total revenues will continue to exceed the increase in our cost of revenues on a year-over-year basis.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including commissions and non-cash stock compensation, for our sales and account management, research, marketing, data analytics and creative design personnel, as well as compensation expense related to acquisition earn-outs and retention bonuses, fees for third-party professional marketing and analytical services and depreciation and amortization expense pertaining to property and equipment. Our sales and marketing departments include data analytics personnel that analyze traffic and advertising ROI data to determine the effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we increase the number of sales, sales support, marketing and analytical personnel.\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Development. Product development expenses consist primarily of costs related to the products and services we provide to our audience, including the costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our website properties. These costs primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, including non-cash stock compensation, for our editorial, product management, technology and customer service personnel, and compensation expense related to acquisition earn-outs. Product development expenses also include fees paid to editorial and technology consultants; other technology costs incurred for maintenance to our technology platforms and infrastructure; depreciation and amortization expense pertaining to property and equipment and capitalized technology costs, including website and mobile development costs and acquired technology assets; and impairments of product development assets when such assets are no longer expected to provide future benefit. We expect our investment in product development to increase as we continue to increase our editorial, product development and technology resources, and as we enhance our product offerings by creating and licensing content, tools and applications, including new offerings for payers and providers.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including non-cash stock compensation, for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and other administrative personnel, as well as compensation expense related to acquisition earn-outs, accounting and legal professional fees and other general corporate expenses, including insurance, facilities expenses and depreciation and amortization expense pertaining to property and equipment and amortization of definite-lived intangible assets. We expect our general and administrative expenses, including accounting and legal-related expenses and insurance costs, to increase as we have transitioned to being a public company.\nInterest Expense, Net\nThese amounts consist principally of interest expense, partially offset by interest income, as well as amortization expense related to deferred financing costs. Interest expense is primarily related to our credit facilities.\nOther Expense\nOther expense consists of certain non-operating expenses, primarily the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and prepayment fees incurred in connection with refinancing our credit facilities.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to tax at the federal, state and local level in the U.S. and in one foreign jurisdiction. Earnings from our limited non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may also be subject to U.S. income tax.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $104.0 million of U.S. federal and state net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. The U.S. federal NOL carryforwards will expire from 2026 through 2033. The full utilization of these NOL carryforwards in the future will be dependent upon our ability to generate taxable income and could be limited due to ownership changes, as defined under the provisions of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Specifically, Section 382 contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to use its previously-recognized NOL carryforwards and specified built-in losses in years after the ownership change. We completed an analysis in 2015 to determine the impact that past ownership changes may have on our ability to use our NOL carryforwards and have determined that, through 2015, there is no Section 382 limitation on our NOL carryforwards as there has not been a change in ownership of more than 50% over the three-year period through 2015. Our NOLs may also be limited under similar provisions of state law. The NOL carryforwards at December 31, 2015 include approximately $7.5 million in income tax deductions related to equity compensation, which will be reflected as a credit to additional paid-in-capital as these NOLs are utilized.\nLoss From Discontinued Operations\nIn November 2013, we sold our Doctor Solutions business, which provided local online directories, search engine marketing and other marketing services to healthcare professionals. The sale represented a disposal of a component of an entity whose operations and cash flows were eliminated from our ongoing business after the sale. As such, the operating results of this business have been reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations.\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods presented. The period-to-period comparisons of the results are not necessarily indicative of our results for future periods.\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consolidated Statement of Operations Data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Advertising and sponsorship revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>209,093 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>166,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134,893 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Premium services revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,957 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>231,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155,850 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,338 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales and marketing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,385 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product development </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,541 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,759 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,462 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>237,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>158,944 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income (loss) from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,100 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,094 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,236 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,711 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,442 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,114 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(359 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income (loss) from continuing operations before (provision) benefit for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,336 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,895 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Provision) benefit for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,304 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,102 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income (loss) from continuing operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,640 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,997 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,239 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,640 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18,236 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nRevenues\nOur total revenues increased 25.9% to $232.0 million in 2015 from $184.3 million in 2014. The $47.7 million increase in total revenues consisted of a $42.6 million increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues and a $5.1 million increase in premium services revenues. No advertiser accounted for 10% or more of total revenues in 2015 or 2014.\nAdvertising and sponsorship revenues increased 25.6% to $209.1 million in 2015 from $166.5 million in 2014. The $42.6 million increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from our pharmaceutical customers, including programs for orphan, rare and specialty diseases and ROI-based campaigns for mature brands. Our acquisitions of DD in the fourth quarter of 2014 and Cambridge in the first quarter of 2015 significantly enhanced the solutions we can offer to pharmaceutical customers.\nPremium services revenues increased 28.2% to $22.9 million in 2015 from $17.9 million in 2014. The $5.1 million increase was primarily from an increase in revenue from our payer and provider customers, including the hospital revenue resulting from our acquisition of Tea Leaves in August 2015, and revenue earned in connection with the termination of a partner licensing agreement in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased 35.8% to $66.9 million in 2015 from $49.3 million in 2014. The $17.6 million increase in cost of revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in royalties to our website partners and media expenses, commensurate with the overall increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues during 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase in cost of revenues also reflects increased expenses for market research incentives, direct mail marketing and fulfillment expenses related primarily to the 2014 and 2015 acquisitions referenced above. Cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased to 28.8% in 2015 from 26.7% in 2014.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased 53.8% to $74.8 million in 2015 from $48.6 million in 2014. This $26.2 million increase was attributable to several factors including: (i) higher cash and non-cash stock compensation expense for the increased staffing in our sales, sales development, sales operations and data analytics departments, which also includes the additional sales-related personnel acquired through the DD and Cambridge acquisitions in 2015; (ii) accrued earn-out and retention bonuses totaling $7.2 million related to the Cambridge, Tea Leaves and DD acquisitions and (iii) accrued executive transition charges and reduction in force severance charges, totaling $2.2 million, for the separation of certain of our executives during 2015. As a result of these factors, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to 32.2% in 2015, as compared to 26.4% in 2014.\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Development. Product development expenses increased 25.5% to $55.9 million in 2015 from $44.5 million in 2014. This $11.4 million increase in product development expenses was primarily due to accrued earn-out expense totaling $4.1 million related to the acquisition of Tea Leaves in 2015 and a $1.4 million asset impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2015 related to certain software development projects which we decided not to move forward with, as well as $2.0 million increased depreciation expense on product development related assets, primarily from the DD acquisition. Product development expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 24.1% in 2015, as compared to 24.2% in 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased 31.4% to $39.5 million in 2015 from $30.0 million in 2014. This $9.5 million increase was attributable to several factors, including: (i) an increase in amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets relating to the DD and Cambridge acquisitions; (ii) higher levels of non-cash stock compensation expense; (iii) accrued executive transition charges totaling $1.3 million for the separation of certain of our executives during 2015; and (iv) higher professional services fee expenses, which include additional expenses related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to 17.0% in 2015, as compared to 16.3% in 2014.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, increase 41.1% to $5.2 million in 2015, compared to $3.7 million in 2014. The $1.5 million increase in interest expense was primarily due to a net increase in the weighted-average outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities of approximately $52.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. This increase was primarily related to additional borrowings to fund the DD and Cambridge acquisitions, coupled with, to a lesser extent, a higher interest rate in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nOther Expense. There were no charges reflected as other expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. Other expense in 2014 consisted primarily of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs totaling $2.8 million and prepayment penalties totaling $1.0 million related to the March 2014 credit facility refinancing.\n(Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes. The (provision) benefit for income taxes was approximately $(1.3) million and $8.7 million during the years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The provision for income taxes in 2015 pertains primarily to deferred income taxes relating to basis differences in indefinite-lived intangible assets that cannot be offset by current year deferred tax assets since its reversal is considered indefinite in nature. Deferred income taxes increased in 2015 by $0.6 million in connection with our 2015 acquisitions, offset by a one-time tax benefit of $0.6 million related to the release of a valuation allowance from finalizing the purchase price valuation of the DD acquisition from 2014. For 2014, the deferred benefit for income taxes includes a one-time tax benefit of $10.0 million associated with the re-measurement of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets related to the DD acquisition, partially offset by a deferred tax charge relating to basis differences in indefinite-lived intangible assets as described above. The remaining provision in 2015 and 2014 pertains primarily to the current provision for federal minimum tax and state and local income taxes.\nComparison of Years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nRevenues\nOur total revenues increased 18.3% to $184.3 million in 2014 from $155.9 million in 2013. The $28.5 million increase in total revenues consisted of a $31.6 million increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in premium services revenues. No advertiser accounted for 10% or more of total revenues in 2014. In 2013, one advertiser accounted for approximately 12% of total revenues.\nAdvertising and sponsorship revenues increased 23.4% to $166.5 million in 2014 from $134.9 million in 2013. The $31.6 million increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues was driven by an increase in revenue per advertiser, as compared to 2013, due to expanded relationships with existing advertisers. The increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues was also attributable to an increase in the number of advertisers that marketed their products and services on Everyday Health properties, driven by a continued focus from our sales team on generating new customer relationships.\nPremium services revenues decreased 14.8% to $17.9 million in 2014 from $21.0 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $4.1 million decrease in subscription fee revenues to $12.9 million in 2014 from $17.0 million in 2013. The decrease in subscription fee revenues was primarily due to a decrease in our average paid subscribers per month, which resulted from a general decline in the popularity of certain of our brands. This decrease was partially offset by subscription fee revenue from a new subscription brand launched in June 2014, and higher average revenue per paid subscriber per month.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased 13.7% to $49.3 million in 2014 from $43.3 million in 2013. The $6.0 million increase in cost of revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in royalties to our partners commensurate with the increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues. Cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 26.7% in 2014 from 27.8% in 2013.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased 9.5% to $48.6 million in 2014 from $44.4 million in 2013. This $4.2 million increase was primarily due to higher levels of compensation expense, including increased staffing and related cash and non-cash stock compensation expense for the sales development, sales operations and data analytics teams associated with generating and supporting increased advertising and sponsorship revenues in 2014 compared to 2013, partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in acquisition earn-out expense in 2014 compared to 2013. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 26.4% in 2014, as compared to 28.5% in 2013.\nProduct Development. Product development expenses increased 1.8% to $44.5 million in 2014 from $43.8 million in 2013. This $0.8 million increase in product development expenses was primarily due to increases in cash and non-cash stock compensation expense, partially offset by a $1.2 million impairment charge in 2013 pertaining to website content and tools which did not recur in 2014. Product development expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 24.2% in 2014, as compared to 28.1% in 2013.\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased 9.4% to $30.0 million in 2014 from $27.5 million in 2013. This $2.6 million increase was primarily due to increases in cash and non-cash stock compensation expense and professional service fee expenses, attributed in part to being public in 2014, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in amortization expense related to intangible assets. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 16.3% in 2014, as compared to 17.6% in 2013.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, decreased 56.0% to $3.7 million in 2014, compared to $8.4 million in 2013. The $4.7 million decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the refinancing of our credit facility in March 2014 at a lower interest rate in 2014 compared with 2013, and to a net decrease in the weighted-average outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nOther Expense. Other expense in 2014 consisted primarily of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs totaling $2.8 million and prepayment penalties totaling $1.0 million related to the March 2014 credit facility refinancing, compared with certain non-operating expense charges totaling $0.4 million in 2013.\n(Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes. The (provision) benefit for income taxes was approximately $8.7 million and $(1.1) million during the years 2014 and 2013, respectively. For 2014, the benefit for income taxes includes a one-time tax benefit of $10.0 million associated with the re-measurement of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets related to the DD acquisition. The remaining provision in 2014 and 2013 pertains primarily to deferred income taxes related to basis differences in indefinite lived intangible assets that could not be offset by current year deferred tax assets, as well as the current provision for state income taxes.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\nLoss from discontinued operations of $5.2 million in 2013 consists of a $1.3 million loss on sale and $3.9 million of operating losses attributable to the Doctor Solutions business, which was sold in November 2013.\nSupplemental Financial Information\nThe following discussion provides information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, a performance measure that is not determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, as well as information regarding certain non-cash operating expenses that are reflected in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation. We use Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP operating performance measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our Board of Directors concerning our financial performance.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus: interest expense, net; income tax provision (benefit); depreciation and amortization expense; stock-based compensation expense; compensation expense related to acquisition earn-out and retention bonus arrangements; write-offs of unamortized deferred financing and other debt extinguishment costs; executive transition and reduction in force charges; contract settlement charges\u037e asset impairment and other charges\u037e preferred stock warrant mark-to-market adjustments and loss from discontinued operations We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods. Furthermore, we believe that:\nTable 174: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA provides investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, helps indicate underlying trends in our business, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations and comparisons with our peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>It is useful to exclude certain non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation and non-core operational charges, such as asset impairment and other charges and write-off of debt extinguishment costs, from Adjusted EBITDA because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not be directly correlated to the underlying performance of our business operations and these expenses can vary significantly between periods. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe do not place undue reliance on Adjusted EBITDA as our only measure of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures, including that other companies may calculate these measures differently than we do, that they do not reflect our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures and that they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital.\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs Adjusted

Since the beginning of 2003, we have issued convertible redeemable preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of $82.0 million, which were converted to common stock upon the IPO on April 2, 2014. Our IPO resulted in net proceeds of $70.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs. As of December 31, 2015, we had $111.1 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility.\nIn March 2015, we refinanced our debt. Under this credit facility, or the Credit Facility, with Silicon Valley Bank and certain other lenders, we maintain a revolver, with a maximum borrowing limit of $82.3 million, and also have a term loan. As of December 31, 2015, there was $66.1 million outstanding on the term loan and $45.0 million outstanding on the revolver, with $37.3 million available to be drawn on the revolver. The repayment terms for any balance outstanding on the revolver provide for quarterly interest payments, with the principal being due in full in November 2019. The repayment terms for the term loan provide for quarterly interest and principal payments, with a maturity date of November 2019. The interest rate on the revolver and the term loan is equal to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a variable rate ranging from 2.75% to 4.0% depending on our consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Facility agreement, and we are charged a commitment fee of 0.50% on the unused portion of the revolver. As of December 31, 2015, the interest rate on our Credit Facility was 4.33%. The Credit Facility contains certain financial and operational covenants with which we must comply, whether or not there are any borrowings outstanding. Such covenants include requirements to maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, each as defined in the Credit Facility, as well as restrictions on certain types of dispositions, mergers and acquisitions, indebtedness, investments, liens and capital expenditures, issuance of capital stock and our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions. We were in compliance with the financial and operational covenants of the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2015. The Credit Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our existing and future assets.\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn February 26, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility, which effected certain modifications to the financial covenants and terms set forth in the Credit Facility. In addition, on March 2, 2016, we drew $15.0 million under the revolver portion of the Credit Facility. As of March 2, 2016, there was $64.4 million outstanding on the term loan and $60.0 million outstanding on the revolver, with $22.3 million available to be drawn on the revolver.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nOur principal uses of cash historically have been to fund operating losses, finance business acquisitions and capital expenditures relating to purchases of property and equipment to support our infrastructure and capitalized product development costs. We currently expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our marketing solutions, including the impact of changes in advertiser spending behavior, and by other factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions, as well as the other risks to our business discussed under Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d Our cash requirements going forward may require us to raise additional funds through borrowing or the issuance of additional equity or equity-linked securities. Any increase in the amount of our borrowings will result in an increase in our interest expense. Future issuance of equity or equity-linked securities will result in dilution to the holders of our common stock. In addition, if the banking system or the financial markets are volatile, our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital could be adversely affected. Additional financing may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nComponents of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,946 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,040 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,672 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63,210 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(79,223 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17,507 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,632 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,189 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20,632 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,646 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $20.9 million, consisting of a net (loss) of $(11.6) million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $34.6 million, including depreciation and amortization, provision for doubtful accounts, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, asset impairment charge, amortization and write-off of deferred financing costs and provision for deferred income taxes. Additionally, changes in operating assets and liabilities used $2.1 million of cash, which was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $17.5 million due to higher advertising and sponsorship revenues, offset by an increase in long-term liabilities of $7.8 million primarily related to acquisition earn-out accruals, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $5.4 million due to the timing of vendor payments, and an increase in deferred revenue of $1.2 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $0.9 million higher in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, resulting primarily from an increase in non-cash expenses of $14.9 million and a decrease in cash used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $10.3 million, offset by an increase in net loss of $24.3 million. The increase in non-cash expenses of $14.9 million is driven by a $10.0 million increase in the deferred income tax provision due to a one-time, non-cash tax benefit related to the DD acquisition in 2014, a $5.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization, a $1.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and a $1.4 million increase in asset impairment charges, offset by a $3.8 million decrease in amortization and write-off of deferred financing costs. The decrease in cash used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $10.3 million is mainly due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $7.4 million and other long-term liabilities of $7.2 million primarily related to acquisition earn-out accruals, partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in accounts receivable.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $20.0 million, consisting of net income of $12.7 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $19.7 million, including depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, amortization and write- off of deferred financing costs, partially offset by a benefit for deferred income taxes. Additionally, changes in operating assets and liabilities used $12.3 million of cash, which was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable due to higher advertising and sponsorship revenues and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of vendor payments, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $18.4 million higher in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, resulting primarily from an increase in net income of $31.1 million, an increase in non-cash stock based compensation of $6.1 million, and a $4.2 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $9.5 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of vendor invoice payments and a $10.0 million decrease in the deferred income tax provision due to a one-time, non-cash tax benefit related to the DD acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 million, consisting of cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of $5.9 million offset by cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations of $4.2 million. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of $5.9 million consisted of a loss from continuing operations of $13.0 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $23.0 million, including depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Additionally, changes in operating assets and liabilities used $4.1 million of cash, which was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable due to higher advertising and sponsorship revenues and in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by an increase in (i) accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of vendor payments and (ii) deferred revenue related to certain marketing campaigns and premium services billed in advance of the services being provided. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations of $4.2 million consisted of a loss from discontinued operations of $5.2 million adjusted for non-cash items, primarily the write-off of certain assets in connection with the sale.\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvesting Activities\nOur primary investing activities have historically consisted of additions to property and equipment, including computer hardware and software, internally-developed software, website development costs, and leasehold improvements. Additionally, our investing activities included payments made to acquire businesses.\nWe used $63.2 million of net cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015, consisting of $14.5 million of additions to property and equipment, $47.3 million for purchase price payments relating to the Cambridge and Tea Leaves acquisitions and $1.4 million for security deposits and other assets. Net cash used in investing activities was $16.0 million lower than in the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to lower purchase price payments in 2015 compared to 2014.\nWe used $79.2 million of net cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014, consisting of $14.8 million of additions to property and equipment and $65.0 million for purchase price payments relating to the DD acquisition. Net cash used in investing activities was $61.7 million higher than in the year ended December 31, 2013.\nWe used $17.5 million of net cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2013, consisting of $10.7 million of additions to property and equipment, $6.7 million for payments relating to the EQAL acquisition, and $0.7 million in security deposits for additional office space. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.0 million higher than in the year ended December 31, 2012.\nFinancing Activities\nOur financing activities have historically consisted of borrowings and repayments under our credit facilities, and related financing costs, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. In addition to such activities, upon closing our IPO in April 2014, we received proceeds from our IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and related offering costs.\nWe generated $21.6 million of net cash in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily from $15.0 million in net borrowings on the revolver portion of our credit facility, $6.1 million of borrowings on the term loan portion of the facility net of principal repayments and $2.6 million received upon the exercise of stock option awards, partially offset by capital lease obligations, financing costs and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of restricted stock units. Net cash provided by financing activities was $72.0 million lower than in the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the $70.6 million net proceeds we received upon the closing of our IPO in 2014.\nWe generated $93.7 million of net cash in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily from $70.6 million received from the net proceeds upon the closing of our IPO, $7.9 million received upon the exercise of stock option awards and $18.7 million of additional net borrowings under our revolver and term loan credit facilities, partially offset by $2.9 million of related financing costs. Net cash provided by financing activities was $85.5 million higher than in the year ended December 31, 2013.\nWe generated $8.2 million of net cash in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily from $11.5 million of additional borrowings under our credit facility partially offset by $2.8 million of principal repayments under our term loan credit facility. Net cash provided by financing activities was $12.8 million lower than in the year ended December 31, 2012.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-term debt obligations (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111,056 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,731 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating lease obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,985 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,218 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,366 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minimum guarantees under royalty agreements (2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,392 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase obligations (3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>256,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,366 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>In addition to the principal repayments due under our Credit Facility shown above based on outstanding borrowings of $111.1 million as of December 31, 2015, interest payments of $4.8 million are due in less than 1 year, $8.6 million in 1-3 years and $4.3 million in 3-5 years when the Credit Facility matures in November 2019.

Accordingly, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows are not subject to off-balance sheet risks.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are often based on judgments that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made, but all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions and it is possible that other professionals, applying their own judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support alternative estimates and assumptions that would result in material changes to our operating results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nWe believe the following reflects our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe generate revenues primarily through advertising and sponsorships, and premium services, including subscriptions and licensing fees.\nWe recognized revenue only when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) the service is performed; and (iv) collectability of the related fee is reasonably assured. While the majority of our revenue transactions are based on standard business terms and conditions, we also enter into non-standard sales agreements with advertisers that sometimes involve multiple elements.\nWe typically recognize advertising revenues in the period in which the advertisement is delivered. Our revenues from sponsorship services and marketing programs are recognized over the period in which we substantially satisfy our contractual obligations set forth in the relevant sponsorship agreements. When contractual arrangements contain multiple elements, revenue is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value determined using prices charged when elements are sold separately. In instances where individual deliverables are not sold separately, or when third-party evidence is not available, fair value is determined based on our best estimate of selling price. Advertising and sponsorship revenues accounted for 90.1%, 90.3% and 86.6% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe recognize subscription revenues ratably over the relevant subscription periods, which for our SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform are typically over the multi-year contract term and for subscriptions sold to individuals are predominantly quarterly, after deducting refunds and charge-backs. For the SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform, customers are typically charged a fee to integrate the platform which is recognized over the contract term and a recurring license fee which is billed monthly. For subscriptions to individuals, we typically charge each subscriber's credit card for the full price for their subscription at the commencement of the subscription period and at each subscription renewal date, unless the consumer cancels the subscription prior to the renewal date. When consumers sign up for free-trial subscriptions, we automatically charge their credit card for a subscription at the end of the free-trial period unless they cancel before the trial period ends. Once billed, the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis, over the subscription period. No revenue is recognized ratably over, or allocated to, the free-trial period.\nWe generally recognize licensing revenue over the life of the contract.\nDeferred revenue consists primarily of (i) subscription fees that we have collected from consumers but for which revenue has not been recognized, and (ii) revenues from advertising and sponsorship services and licensing fees that we have billed in advance of when the revenue is to be earned.\nInternal Software and Website Development Cost\nWe incur costs to develop software for internal use and for our website and mobile applications. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, we capitalize costs, consisting principally of payroll and related benefits, third-party consultants and related charges, incurred during the application development phase of a project as well as the costs of content developed for our properties by third-party consultants which is deemed to be reference material in nature and to provide a future economic benefit. Upon completion of a project, the capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which is typically three years. We exercise judgment in determining the point at which various projects may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of capitalized costs, and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized.\nSoftware and website development costs that do not meet the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred and are included in product development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill resulting from our acquisitions represents the excess cost over fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets of acquired businesses. The allocation of purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to definite-lived intangible assets (discussed further below).\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Application of the impairment test requires judgment and results in impairment being recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. We operate as one operating segment and one reporting unit.\nWe perform an initial qualitative analysis to evaluate whether any events and circumstances occurred or exist that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further assessment of the reporting unit's goodwill is necessary. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the goodwill must be tested using a two-step quantitative process, and if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.\nThe evaluation of our goodwill annually on October 1 indicated that the carrying value of the asset was less than the fair value and, accordingly, there was no impairment loss recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets, in addition to goodwill discussed above, consist of property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives. These intangible assets resulted from our business acquisitions, and consist of trade names, customer relationships and agreements with certain of our website partners.\nThe amount assigned to our definite-lived intangible assets is a subjective analysis based on our estimates of the future benefit of these assets using acceptable valuation techniques. The estimated fair values assigned to our trade names and other definite-lived intangible assets are computed based on discounted cash flows using the Relief From Royalty Method and Excess Earnings Method, respectively, which applies various assumptions developed by management, including projected revenues, operating margins, attrition rates, royalty rates and discount rates.\nOur property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets are depreciated and amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally three to five years for property and equipment and three to ten years for definite-lived intangible assets, which are determined based on several factors, primarily the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service and provide benefit to us. We review these definite-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2015, an impairment charge of $1,416 was recorded related to certain software development projects included in property and equipment, which we decided not to move forward with. There were no indicators of impairment of these definite-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded impairment charges of $1.2 million related to certain website costs included in property and equipment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the current authoritative accounting guidance, under which stock-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, are measured at fair value as of the grant date and recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period), which we have elected to amortize using the graded attribution method.\nWe calculate the fair value of each restricted stock unit award based on our stock price on the date of grant. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option and Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP\u201d) awards. As there was no public market for our common stock prior to our IPO in March 2014, and therefore a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have determined the share price volatility for awards granted based on an analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies that granted awards with substantially similar terms. The expected volatility of awards granted has been determined using an average of the historical realized volatility measures of this peer group of companies for a period of time commensurate with the expected term of the option. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar entities until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified entities are no longer similar to us. In this latter case, more suitable entities whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.\nThe expected life of options granted has been determined utilizing the simplified method for determining the expected life for options qualifying for treatment due to the limited history we have with option exercise activity. The expected term for ESPP shares is based on the purchase period. The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods equal to the expected term of the awards on the grant date. We have not paid, and do not anticipate paying, cash dividends on our shares of common stock, and the expected dividend yield is, therefore, assumed to be zero.\nIn addition, stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant, based on our historical forfeiture experience, and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nThe assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. The assumptions we used in the Black-Scholes pricing model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment. If any of the assumptions used in this pricing model change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially from the awards granted previously. Additionally, the pricing model fair value of the awards is based upon the fair value of our underlying common stock.\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and one foreign jurisdiction. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the tax and financial statement reporting basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nThe components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. We reduce the measurement of a deferred tax asset, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize some or all of the deferred tax asset. As a result of our historical operating performance and the cumulative net losses incurred to date, we do not have sufficient objective evidence to support the recovery of the net deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we have established a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets for financial reporting purposes because we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon technical merits, it is more-likely-than-not\u201d that the position will be sustained upon examination. Potential interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions are recognized in income tax expense.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued amended guidance for reporting discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, only disposals that represent a strategic shift having a material impact on an entity's operations and financial results shall be reported as discontinued operations, with expanded disclosures. This amendment will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2015. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of this guidance to be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance for revenue recognition. This amendment provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model. The core principle of the guidance is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The amendment was originally to be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In August 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral of the effective date to December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the effect that the new standard will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance on stock compensation accounting requiring that a performance target that affects vesting and could be achieved after the requisite service period should be treated as a performance condition. Current GAAP does not contain explicit guidance on how to account for such share-based payments. This updated guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of this guidance to be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. The new guidance requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. This guidance will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2016 on a retrospective basis for all periods presented, with early adoption optional. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of this guidance to be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on business combinations accounting requiring the acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Previously, such adjustments were required to be retrospectively recorded in prior period financial information. The amended guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The standard is to be applied prospectively, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of this guidance to be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on balance sheet classification of deferred taxes, requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The classification change for all deferred taxes as non-current simplifies entities' processes as it eliminates the need to separately identify the net current and net non-current deferred tax asset or liability in each jurisdiction and allocate valuation allowances. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with earlier application permitted. We elected to early adopt this guidance on a retrospective basis effective December 31, 2014. As a result of the retrospective adoption, the Company reclassified $0.7 million from current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax liabilities in the 2014 balance sheet.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on leases which, for operating leases, requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in its balance sheet. The standard also requires a lessee to recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term, on a generally straight-line basis. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. We are currently evaluating the effects of the adoption and have not yet determined the impact the revised guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_truncated": "Since our operating decisions are based on aggregating and monetizing our audience as a whole, we believe that our aggregate gross profit is an important measure of our overall performance.

Cost of revenues increased 35.8% to $66.9 million in 2015 from $49.3 million in 2014. The $17.6 million increase in cost of revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in royalties to our website partners and media expenses, commensurate with the overall increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues during 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase in cost of revenues also reflects increased expenses for market research incentives, direct mail marketing and fulfillment expenses related primarily to the 2014 and 2015 acquisitions referenced above.

At the same time, dramatically-reduced sales forces and other restrictions on interacting directly with physicians have made it more difficult for pharmaceutical companies to efficiently market their products and services. As a result, we believe the need for these companies to interact with consumers and physicians more directly through digital channels will increase significantly. \nKey Trends Affecting Our Business\nOur premium services revenues include revenues generated from subscriptions sold to individuals who purchase access for a defined period of time to one or more of our properties. Our subscription services are designed to provide the consumer with the ability to access consumer health content from well-recognized sources, and to personalize or customize a specific health or wellness program. Over the last several years, we have intentionally focused more directly on increasing our advertising and sponsorship revenues and less on expanding our consumer subscription revenues. By virtue of our acquisition of Tea Leaves in August 2015, premium services revenues also include fees generated from the license of Tea Leaves' SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform to hospital systems. These licensing agreements are typically multi-year contracts with recurring licensing fees. The related custom marketing programs that are sold to hospital customers that license our SaaS platform are allocated to advertising and sponsorship revenues.\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>

The $5.1 million increase was primarily from an increase in revenue from our payer and provider customers, including the hospital revenue resulting from our acquisition of Tea Leaves in August 2015, and revenue earned in connection with the termination of a partner licensing agreement in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $0.9 million higher in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, resulting primarily from an increase in non-cash expenses of $14.9 million and a decrease in cash used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $10.3 million, offset by an increase in net loss of $24.3 million. The increase in non-cash expenses of $14.9 million is driven by a $10.0 million increase in the deferred income tax provision due to a one-time, non-cash tax benefit related to the DD acquisition in 2014, a $5.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization, a $1.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and a $1.4 million increase in asset impairment charges, offset by a $3.8 million decrease in amortization and write-off of deferred financing costs. The decrease in cash used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $10.3 million is mainly due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $7.4 million and other long-term liabilities of $7.2 million primarily related to acquisition earn-out accruals, partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in accounts receivable.\n (1) In addition to the principal repayments due under our Credit Facility shown above based on outstanding borrowings of $111.1 million as of December 31, 2015, interest payments of $4.8 million are due in less than 1 year, $8.6 million in 1-3 years and $4.3 million in 3-5 years when the Credit Facility matures in November 2019. For a description of our long-term debt obligations, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Sources of Liquidity and Long-Term Debt\u201d above. (2) Some of the minimum guaranteed payments are subject to reductions if specified performance metrics are not achieved by our partners with respect to our non-operated properties. (3) Purchase obligations pertain primarily to fees for third-party content, technology and other services. \n \u00b7 It is useful to exclude certain non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation and non-core operational charges, such as asset impairment and other charges and write-off of debt extinguishment costs, from Adjusted EBITDA because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not be directly correlated to the underlying performance of our business operations and these expenses can vary significantly between periods. \nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nRevenues\nOther Expense. There were no charges reflected as other expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. Other expense in 2014 consisted primarily of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs totaling $2.8 million and prepayment penalties totaling $1.0 million related to the March 2014 credit facility refinancing.\n\n \u00b7 interactive brand sponsorships, which consist of our integrated database marketing programs and sponsorships on our properties, which typically include both components that are sold based on a cost-per-impression basis (in which we are paid based on the number of advertisements we display) and components that are sold based on a cost-per-visitor basis (in which we are paid for delivering a visitor to an advertiser's website), and sometimes include a production fee; \nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including non-cash stock compensation, for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and other administrative personnel, as well as compensation expense related to acquisition earn-outs, accounting and legal professional fees and other general corporate expenses, including insurance, facilities expenses and depreciation and amortization expense pertaining to property and equipment and amortization of definite-lived intangible assets. We expect our general and administrative expenses, including accounting and legal-related expenses and insurance costs, to increase as we have transitioned to being a public company.\nWe are subject to tax at the federal, state and local level in the U.S. and in one foreign jurisdiction. Earnings from our limited non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may also be subject to U.S. income tax.\nWe carefully monitor our gross profit and gross margin because they are key indicators of our financial performance and success in aggregating and monetizing our audience across the Everyday Health properties. Gross profit is defined as total revenues minus cost of revenues. Gross margin is defined as our gross profit as a percentage of our total revenues. While we focus on the growth of both gross profit and gross margin, we may make investments from time to time that will position us for growth at the expense of gross margin.\nSources of Liquidity and Long-Term Debt\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus: interest expense, net; income tax provision (benefit); depreciation and amortization expense; stock-based compensation expense; compensation expense related to acquisition earn-out and retention bonus arrangements; write-offs of unamortized deferred financing and other debt extinguishment costs; executive transition and reduction in force charges; contract settlement charges; asset impairment and other charges; preferred stock warrant mark-to-market adjustments and loss from discontinued operations We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods. Furthermore, we believe that:\nWe incur costs to develop software for internal use and for our website and mobile applications. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, we capitalize costs, consisting principally of payroll and related benefits, third-party consultants and related charges, incurred during the application development phase of a project as well as the costs of content developed for our properties by third-party consultants which is deemed to be reference material in nature and to provide a future economic benefit. Upon completion of a project, the capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which is typically three years. We exercise judgment in determining the point at which various projects may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of capitalized costs, and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized.\nOur primary investing activities have historically consisted of additions to property and equipment, including computer hardware and software, internally-developed software, website development costs, and leasehold improvements. Additionally, our investing activities included payments made to acquire businesses.\nIn 2014 and 2015, we made the strategic decision to leverage our existing assets to generate revenue from new customer bases across the broader healthcare landscape, particularly payers and providers. Specifically, the goal was to utilize our large, highly-engaged audience, premium content and tools, and advanced data and analytics capabilities to engage and influence consumers and healthcare professionals on behalf of entities such as health insurers and hospitals. In August 2015, we acquired Tea Leaves Health, LLC, or Tea Leaves, a provider of a SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform for hospital systems to identify and engage consumers and physicians. Tea Leaves generates revenues from multi-year contracts with recurring licensing fees, as well as related custom marketing programs that drive incremental advertising revenue. We believe there is a significant revenue opportunity in providing hospital systems with marketing solutions to target both consumers and physicians and to provide measurable ROI for their strategic planning and marketing efforts.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased 31.4% to $39.5 million in 2015 from $30.0 million in 2014. This $9.5 million increase was attributable to several factors, including: (i) an increase in amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets relating to the DD and Cambridge acquisitions; (ii) higher levels of non-cash stock compensation expense; (iii) accrued executive transition charges totaling $1.3 million for the separation of certain of our executives during 2015; and (iv) higher professional services fee expenses, which include additional expenses related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to 17.0% in 2015, as compared to 16.3% in 2014.\nBackground Information\nWe used $63.2 million of net cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015, consisting of $14.5 million of additions to property and equipment, $47.3 million for purchase price payments relating to the Cambridge and Tea Leaves acquisitions and $1.4 million for security deposits and other assets. Net cash used in investing activities was $16.0 million lower than in the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to lower purchase price payments in 2015 compared to 2014.\n (1) Stock compensation expense includes charges related to the Company's ESPP beginning in 2014. Refer to Note 11-Stock-Based Compensation\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe generally recognize licensing revenue over the life of the contract.\n(Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes. The (provision) benefit for income taxes was approximately $8.7 million and $(1.1) million during the years 2014 and 2013, respectively. For 2014, the benefit for income taxes includes a one-time tax benefit of $10.0 million associated with the re-measurement of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets related to the DD acquisition. The remaining provision in 2014 and 2013 pertains primarily to deferred income taxes related to basis differences in indefinite lived intangible assets that could not be offset by current year deferred tax assets, as well as the current provision for state income taxes.\nRevenues\nThese amounts consist principally of interest expense, partially offset by interest income, as well as amortization expense related to deferred financing costs. Interest expense is primarily related to our credit facilities.\n \n \u00b7 royalty payments to our partners; and \nSoftware and website development costs that do not meet the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred and are included in product development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOur primary sources of cash have historically been proceeds from the issuance of convertible redeemable preferred stock, bank borrowings and our IPO. Since the beginning of 2003, we have issued convertible redeemable preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of $82.0 million, which were converted to common stock upon the IPO on April 2, 2014. Our IPO resulted in net proceeds of $70.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs. As of December 31, 2015, we had $111.1 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility.\nWe expect our advertising and sponsorship revenues to increase in 2016. We expect our premium services revenue to decrease in 2016, as the increase in hospital SaaS revenue will be offset by the decline in consumer subscription revenues.\nOn February 26, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility, which effected certain modifications to the financial covenants and terms set forth in the Credit Facility. In addition, on March 2, 2016, we drew $15.0 million under the revolver portion of the Credit Facility. As of March 2, 2016, there was $64.4 million outstanding on the term loan and $60.0 million outstanding on the revolver, with $22.3 million available to be drawn on the revolver.\nWe generated $93.7 million of net cash in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily from $70.6 million received from the net proceeds upon the closing of our IPO, $7.9 million received upon the exercise of stock option awards and $18.7 million of additional net borrowings under our revolver and term loan credit facilities, partially offset by $2.9 million of related financing costs. Net cash provided by financing activities was $85.5 million higher than in the year ended December 31, 2013.\nSupplemental Financial Information\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n \nIn April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued amended guidance for reporting discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, only disposals that represent a strategic shift having a material impact on an entity's operations and financial results shall be reported as discontinued operations, with expanded disclosures. This amendment will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2015. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of this guidance to be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance for revenue recognition. This amendment provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model. The core principle of the guidance is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The amendment was originally to be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In August 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral of the effective date to December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the effect that the new standard will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nWe expect our gross profit to continue to improve in the near term as we continue to aggregate our audience more efficiently and enhance our monetization capabilities. While we expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase on an absolute basis in the foreseeable future, we do not believe that any such increases will negatively impact our gross profit or Adjusted EBITDA since we anticipate that the growth in our total revenues will continue to exceed the increase in our cost of revenues on a year-over-year basis.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance on stock compensation accounting requiring that a performance target that affects vesting and could be achieved after the requisite service period should be treated as a performance condition. Current GAAP does not contain explicit guidance on how to account for such share-based payments. This updated guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of this guidance to be material to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe generated $8.2 million of net cash in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily from $11.5 million of additional borrowings under our credit facility partially offset by $2.8 million of principal repayments under our term loan credit facility. Net cash provided by financing activities was $12.8 million lower than in the year ended December 31, 2012.\nWe generated $21.6 million of net cash in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily from $15.0 million in net borrowings on the revolver portion of our credit facility, $6.1 million of borrowings on the term loan portion of the facility net of principal repayments and $2.6 million received upon the exercise of stock option awards, partially offset by capital lease obligations, financing costs and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of restricted stock units. Net cash provided by financing activities was $72.0 million lower than in the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the $70.6 million net proceeds we received upon the closing of our IPO in 2014.\nAs Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, the following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. The new guidance requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. This guidance will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2016 on a retrospective basis for all periods presented, with early adoption optional. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of this guidance to be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe typically recognize advertising revenues in the period in which the advertisement is delivered. Our revenues from sponsorship services and marketing programs are recognized over the period in which we substantially satisfy our contractual obligations set forth in the relevant sponsorship agreements. When contractual arrangements contain multiple elements, revenue is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value determined using prices charged when elements are sold separately. In instances where individual deliverables are not sold separately, or when third-party evidence is not available, fair value is determined based on our best estimate of selling price. Advertising and sponsorship revenues accounted for 90.1%, 90.3% and 86.6% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $30.1 million and working capital of $59.2 million.\n\nIn addition, stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant, based on our historical forfeiture experience, and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\n \u00b7 marketing programs that provide for revenues based upon the ROI we deliver for our customers, primarily pharmaceutical customers; and \n\n \nOur total revenues increased 25.9% to $232.0 million in 2015 from $184.3 million in 2014. The $47.7 million increase in total revenues consisted of a $42.6 million increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues and a $5.1 million increase in premium services revenues. No advertiser accounted for 10% or more of total revenues in 2015 or 2014.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased 53.8% to $74.8 million in 2015 from $48.6 million in 2014. This $26.2 million increase was attributable to several factors including: (i) higher cash and non-cash stock compensation expense for the increased staffing in our sales, sales development, sales operations and data analytics departments, which also includes the additional sales-related personnel acquired through the DD and Cambridge acquisitions in 2015; (ii) accrued earn-out and retention bonuses totaling $7.2 million related to the Cambridge, Tea Leaves and DD acquisitions and (iii) accrued executive transition charges and reduction in force severance charges, totaling $2.2 million, for the separation of certain of our executives during 2015. As a result of these factors, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to 32.2% in 2015, as compared to 26.4% in 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nIn November 2013, we sold our Doctor Solutions business, which provided local online directories, search engine marketing and other marketing services to healthcare professionals. The sale represented a disposal of a component of an entity whose operations and cash flows were eliminated from our ongoing business after the sale. As such, the operating results of this business have been reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe expected life of options granted has been determined utilizing the simplified method for determining the expected life for options qualifying for treatment due to the limited history we have with option exercise activity. The expected term for ESPP shares is based on the purchase period. The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods equal to the expected term of the awards on the grant date. We have not paid, and do not anticipate paying, cash dividends on our shares of common stock, and the expected dividend yield is, therefore, assumed to be zero.\nIn March 2015, we expanded our ability to service pharmaceutical companies through the acquisition of Cambridge BioMarketing Group, LLC, or Cambridge, a provider of strategic launch and marketing solutions for orphan and rare disease products. Following this acquisition, we believe that our platform can service our pharmaceutical partners across the entire spectrum of therapeutic areas, including orphan, specialty and mass market brands, as well as provide solutions throughout the entire lifecycle of pharmaceutical marketing, from the strategic phase of pre-launch, during the growth years and beyond the loss of patent exclusivity.\nMore specifically, our advertising and sponsorship solutions include, among others:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased 13.7% to $49.3 million in 2014 from $43.3 million in 2013. The $6.0 million increase in cost of revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in royalties to our partners commensurate with the increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues. Cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 26.7% in 2014 from 27.8% in 2013.\n \u00b7 display advertisements on our properties and in our free e-mail newsletters, which are primarily sold based on a cost-per-impression advertising model; \nWe generate revenues primarily through advertising and sponsorships, and premium services, including subscriptions and licensing fees.\nThe assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. The assumptions we used in the Black-Scholes pricing model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment. If any of the assumptions used in this pricing model change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially from the awards granted previously. Additionally, the pricing model fair value of the awards is based upon the fair value of our underlying common stock.\nFinancing Activities\n \nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are often based on judgments that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made, but all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions and it is possible that other professionals, applying their own judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support alternative estimates and assumptions that would result in material changes to our operating results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $20.9 million, consisting of a net (loss) of $(11.6) million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $34.6 million, including depreciation and amortization, provision for doubtful accounts, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, asset impairment charge, amortization and write-off of deferred financing costs and provision for deferred income taxes. Additionally, changes in operating assets and liabilities used $2.1 million of cash, which was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $17.5 million due to higher advertising and sponsorship revenues, offset by an increase in long-term liabilities of $7.8 million primarily related to acquisition earn-out accruals, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $5.4 million due to the timing of vendor payments, and an increase in deferred revenue of $1.2 million.\nAdvertising and sponsorship revenues increased 25.6% to $209.1 million in 2015 from $166.5 million in 2014. The $42.6 million increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from our pharmaceutical customers, including programs for orphan, rare and specialty diseases and ROI-based campaigns for mature brands. Our acquisitions of DD in the fourth quarter of 2014 and Cambridge in the first quarter of 2015 significantly enhanced the solutions we can offer to pharmaceutical customers.\nComparison of Years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased 9.5% to $48.6 million in 2014 from $44.4 million in 2013. This $4.2 million increase was primarily due to higher levels of compensation expense, including increased staffing and related cash and non-cash stock compensation expense for the sales development, sales operations and data analytics teams associated with generating and supporting increased advertising and sponsorship revenues in 2014 compared to 2013, partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in acquisition earn-out expense in 2014 compared to 2013. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 26.4% in 2014, as compared to 28.5% in 2013.\nResults of Operations\nThe Everyday Health platform provides digital marketing and communications solutions that engage consumers and healthcare professionals across a variety of health categories. Cost of revenues consists primarily of the expenses associated with aggregating the total audience across the Everyday Health properties or delivering an audience to fulfill a marketing campaign. These costs include:\nOur financing activities have historically consisted of borrowings and repayments under our credit facilities, and related financing costs, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. In addition to such activities, upon closing our IPO in April 2014, we received proceeds from our IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and related offering costs.\nWe recognized revenue only when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) the service is performed; and (iv) collectability of the related fee is reasonably assured. While the majority of our revenue transactions are based on standard business terms and conditions, we also enter into non-standard sales agreements with advertisers that sometimes involve multiple elements.\nPrior to late 2010, our primary focus was on offering content and tools to consumers and selling marketing solutions targeting only health consumers. In late 2010, we made a strategic decision to expand our business into the market for providing content and marketing solutions targeting healthcare professionals through our acquisition of MedPage Holdings, Inc., or MPT. We believe that the entry into the healthcare professional market provided us with a significant revenue opportunity because pharmaceutical companies spend a larger percentage of their marketing budgets targeting healthcare professionals as compared to consumers.\n \nIn September 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on business combinations accounting requiring the acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Previously, such adjustments were required to be retrospectively recorded in prior period financial information. The amended guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The standard is to be applied prospectively, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of this guidance to be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nProduct Development. Product development expenses increased 1.8% to $44.5 million in 2014 from $43.8 million in 2013. This $0.8 million increase in product development expenses was primarily due to increases in cash and non-cash stock compensation expense, partially offset by a $1.2 million impairment charge in 2013 pertaining to website content and tools which did not recur in 2014. Product development expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 24.2% in 2014, as compared to 28.1% in 2013.\n \u00b7 media costs; \nBoth our revenues and gross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year periods, as shown in the table below.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods presented. The period-to-period comparisons of the results are not necessarily indicative of our results for future periods.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on balance sheet classification of deferred taxes, requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The classification change for all deferred taxes as non-current simplifies entities' processes as it eliminates the need to separately identify the net current and net non-current deferred tax asset or liability in each jurisdiction and allocate valuation allowances. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with earlier application permitted. We elected to early adopt this guidance on a retrospective basis effective December 31, 2014. As a result of the retrospective adoption, the Company reclassified $0.7 million from current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax liabilities in the 2014 balance sheet.\nWorking Capital\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $104.0 million of U.S. federal and state net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. The U.S. federal NOL carryforwards will expire from 2026 through 2033. The full utilization of these NOL carryforwards in the future will be dependent upon our ability to generate taxable income and could be limited due to ownership changes, as defined under the provisions of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Specifically, Section 382 contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to use its previously-recognized NOL carryforwards and specified built-in losses in years after the ownership change. We completed an analysis in 2015 to determine the impact that past ownership changes may have on our ability to use our NOL carryforwards and have determined that, through 2015, there is no Section 382 limitation on our NOL carryforwards as there has not been a change in ownership of more than 50% over the three-year period through 2015. Our NOLs may also be limited under similar provisions of state law. The NOL carryforwards at December 31, 2015 include approximately $7.5 million in income tax deductions related to equity compensation, which will be reflected as a credit to additional paid-in-capital as these NOLs are utilized.\nThe following table summarizes our depreciation and amortization and stock compensation expenses included in the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table above and details the breakdown of such expenses in the respective statements of operations line-items.\n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA provides investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, helps indicate underlying trends in our business, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations and comparisons with our peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results; and \nComparison of Years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nIn late 2014, we expanded further into the healthcare professional sector with the acquisition of DoctorDirectory.com, Inc., or DD, a provider of multi-channel marketing solutions for pharmaceutical brands seeking to influence healthcare professionals. The acquisition of DD helped deepen our penetration into the healthcare professional market by significantly increasing our physician audience and enhancing our sophisticated ROI-based marketing solutions that we offer advertisers seeking to engage with healthcare professionals.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $18.4 million higher in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, resulting primarily from an increase in net income of $31.1 million, an increase in non-cash stock based compensation of $6.1 million, and a $4.2 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $9.5 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of vendor invoice payments and a $10.0 million decrease in the deferred income tax provision due to a one-time, non-cash tax benefit related to the DD acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.\n(Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes. The (provision) benefit for income taxes was approximately $(1.3) million and $8.7 million during the years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The provision for income taxes in 2015 pertains primarily to deferred income taxes relating to basis differences in indefinite-lived intangible assets that cannot be offset by current year deferred tax assets since its reversal is considered indefinite in nature. Deferred income taxes increased in 2015 by $0.6 million in connection with our 2015 acquisitions, offset by a one-time tax benefit of $0.6 million related to the release of a valuation allowance from finalizing the purchase price valuation of the DD acquisition from 2014. For 2014, the deferred benefit for income taxes includes a one-time tax benefit of $10.0 million associated with the re-measurement of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets related to the DD acquisition, partially offset by a deferred tax charge relating to basis differences in indefinite-lived intangible assets as described above. The remaining provision in 2015 and 2014 pertains primarily to the current provision for federal minimum tax and state and local income taxes.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe recognize subscription revenues ratably over the relevant subscription periods, which for our SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform are typically over the multi-year contract term and for subscriptions sold to individuals are predominantly quarterly, after deducting refunds and charge-backs. For the SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform, customers are typically charged a fee to integrate the platform which is recognized over the contract term and a recurring license fee which is billed monthly. For subscriptions to individuals, we typically charge each subscriber's credit card for the full price for their subscription at the commencement of the subscription period and at each subscription renewal date, unless the consumer cancels the subscription prior to the renewal date. When consumers sign up for free-trial subscriptions, we automatically charge their credit card for a subscription at the end of the free-trial period unless they cancel before the trial period ends. Once billed, the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis, over the subscription period. No revenue is recognized ratably over, or allocated to, the free-trial period.\nWe believe the following reflects our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe account for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the current authoritative accounting guidance, under which stock-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, are measured at fair value as of the grant date and recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period), which we have elected to amortize using the graded attribution method.\nWe operate a leading digital marketing and communications platform for healthcare marketers seeking to engage and influence consumers and healthcare professionals. We combine premium health and wellness content with sophisticated proprietary data and analytics tools to enable healthcare marketers to communicate with our large audience of consumers and healthcare professionals. During 2015, our customers included five of the top ten global advertisers in 2014, as compiled by Advertising Age, 24 of the top 25 global pharmaceutical companies ranked by 2014 revenue, and more than 350 hospitals across 30 states, including six of the top ten largest health systems in the U.S.\nThe evaluation of our goodwill annually on October 1 indicated that the carrying value of the asset was less than the fair value and, accordingly, there was no impairment loss recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe amount assigned to our definite-lived intangible assets is a subjective analysis based on our estimates of the future benefit of these assets using acceptable valuation techniques. The estimated fair values assigned to our trade names and other definite-lived intangible assets are computed based on discounted cash flows using the Relief From Royalty Method and Excess Earnings Method, respectively, which applies various assumptions developed by management, including projected revenues, operating margins, attrition rates, royalty rates and discount rates.\n \nWe perform an initial qualitative analysis to evaluate whether any events and circumstances occurred or exist that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further assessment of the reporting unit's goodwill is necessary. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the goodwill must be tested using a two-step quantitative process, and if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.\n \u00b7 marketing programs that are sold based on a time and materials basis. \nAlthough we typically do not distinguish between desktop and mobile channels in the structuring and pricing of our marketing campaigns, mobile channels have become increasingly important in fulfilling these campaigns as overall mobile traffic has increased. Revenues delivered via mobile channels increased 8.1% to $73.1 million in 2015 from $67.7 million in 2014.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon technical merits, it is more-likely-than-not\u201d that the position will be sustained upon examination. Potential interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions are recognized in income tax expense.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased 9.4% to $30.0 million in 2014 from $27.5 million in 2013. This $2.6 million increase was primarily due to increases in cash and non-cash stock compensation expense and professional service fee expenses, attributed in part to being public in 2014, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in amortization expense related to intangible assets. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 16.3% in 2014, as compared to 17.6% in 2013.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\nOur property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets are depreciated and amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally three to five years for property and equipment and three to ten years for definite-lived intangible assets, which are determined based on several factors, primarily the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service and provide benefit to us. We review these definite-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2015, an impairment charge of $1,416 was recorded related to certain software development projects included in property and equipment, which we decided not to move forward with. There were no indicators of impairment of these definite-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded impairment charges of $1.2 million related to certain website costs included in property and equipment.\nThe components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. We reduce the measurement of a deferred tax asset, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize some or all of the deferred tax asset. As a result of our historical operating performance and the cumulative net losses incurred to date, we do not have sufficient objective evidence to support the recovery of the net deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we have established a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets for financial reporting purposes because we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and one foreign jurisdiction. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the tax and financial statement reporting basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nInterest Expense, Net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 million, consisting of cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of $5.9 million offset by cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations of $4.2 million. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of $5.9 million consisted of a loss from continuing operations of $13.0 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $23.0 million, including depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Additionally, changes in operating assets and liabilities used $4.1 million of cash, which was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable due to higher advertising and sponsorship revenues and in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by an increase in (i) accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of vendor payments and (ii) deferred revenue related to certain marketing campaigns and premium services billed in advance of the services being provided. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations of $4.2 million consisted of a loss from discontinued operations of $5.2 million adjusted for non-cash items, primarily the write-off of certain assets in connection with the sale.\n \nWe do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, as part of our ongoing business. Accordingly, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows are not subject to off-balance sheet risks.\n \u00b7 to a lesser extent, market research incentives, direct mail marketing and fulfillment costs, as well as costs associated with subscription fees for our premium services, ad serving and other expenses. \n \nInternal Software and Website Development Cost\nAdvertising and sponsorship revenues constitute a significant majority of our total revenues. We also generate revenues from premium services, which consist primarily of digital subscriptions sold to consumers and fees from hospitals for licensing our SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, decreased 56.0% to $3.7 million in 2014, compared to $8.4 million in 2013. The $4.7 million decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the refinancing of our credit facility in March 2014 at a lower interest rate in 2014 compared with 2013, and to a net decrease in the weighted-average outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on leases which, for operating leases, requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in its balance sheet. The standard also requires a lessee to recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term, on a generally straight-line basis. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. We are currently evaluating the effects of the adoption and have not yet determined the impact the revised guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nOur total revenues increased 18.3% to $184.3 million in 2014 from $155.9 million in 2013. The $28.5 million increase in total revenues consisted of a $31.6 million increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in premium services revenues. No advertiser accounted for 10% or more of total revenues in 2014. In 2013, one advertiser accounted for approximately 12% of total revenues.\nProduct Development. Product development expenses increased 25.5% to $55.9 million in 2015 from $44.5 million in 2014. This $11.4 million increase in product development expenses was primarily due to accrued earn-out expense totaling $4.1 million related to the acquisition of Tea Leaves in 2015 and a $1.4 million asset impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2015 related to certain software development projects which we decided not to move forward with, as well as $2.0 million increased depreciation expense on product development related assets, primarily from the DD acquisition. Product development expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 24.1% in 2015, as compared to 24.2% in 2014.\nOur principal uses of cash historically have been to fund operating losses, finance business acquisitions and capital expenditures relating to purchases of property and equipment to support our infrastructure and capitalized product development costs. We currently expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our marketing solutions, including the impact of changes in advertiser spending behavior, and by other factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions, as well as the other risks to our business discussed under Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d Our cash requirements going forward may require us to raise additional funds through borrowing or the issuance of additional equity or equity-linked securities. Any increase in the amount of our borrowings will result in an increase in our interest expense. Future issuance of equity or equity-linked securities will result in dilution to the holders of our common stock. In addition, if the banking system or the financial markets are volatile, our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital could be adversely affected. Additional financing may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIncome Taxes\n\nOverview\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including commissions and non-cash stock compensation, for our sales and account management, research, marketing, data analytics and creative design personnel, as well as compensation expense related to acquisition earn-outs and retention bonuses, fees for third-party professional marketing and analytical services and depreciation and amortization expense pertaining to property and equipment. Our sales and marketing departments include data analytics personnel that analyze traffic and advertising ROI data to determine the effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we increase the number of sales, sales support, marketing and analytical personnel.\nProduct Development. Product development expenses consist primarily of costs related to the products and services we provide to our audience, including the costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our website properties. These costs primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, including non-cash stock compensation, for our editorial, product management, technology and customer service personnel, and compensation expense related to acquisition earn-outs. Product development expenses also include fees paid to editorial and technology consultants; other technology costs incurred for maintenance to our technology platforms and infrastructure; depreciation and amortization expense pertaining to property and equipment and capitalized technology costs, including website and mobile development costs and acquired technology assets; and impairments of product development assets when such assets are no longer expected to provide future benefit. We expect our investment in product development to increase as we continue to increase our editorial, product development and technology resources, and as we enhance our product offerings by creating and licensing content, tools and applications, including new offerings for payers and providers.\nGiven the size and scope of our content and audience assets, we offer a variety of advertising and sponsorship solutions that engage consumers and healthcare professionals across a variety of health categories. Our diverse customer base for these marketing solutions consists primarily of pharmaceutical companies, manufacturers and retailers of over-the-counter products and consumer-packaged-goods, and, to a lesser extent, healthcare providers, such as hospital systems, and health insurers. Pharmaceutical companies represent our largest customer group. In addition to offering a wide range of marketing solutions, we also utilize a variety of revenue models depending on the specific needs and profile of the customer. For example, we may price our marketing solutions on (i) a fixed fee basis, (ii) a cost-per-impression (CPM) or cost-per-visitor (CPV) basis, or (iii) the ROI we deliver from a specific campaign. An increasing number of our marketing programs provide for revenues to us based primarily upon the ROI we deliver, such as the increase in prescription activity for a pharmaceutical product.\nTo a lesser extent, we generate revenues from the sale of our premium services, which consist primarily of (i) fees from hospitals for licensing our SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform and (ii) digital subscriptions sold to consumers for access to our consumer diet and fitness properties. In recent years, we have intentionally decreased our focus on generating revenues from consumer subscriptions and this trend will continue in 2016.\nWe used $79.2 million of net cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014, consisting of $14.8 million of additions to property and equipment and $65.0 million for purchase price payments relating to the DD acquisition. Net cash used in investing activities was $61.7 million higher than in the year ended December 31, 2013.\n \u00b7 programs that allow marketers the opportunity to target specific audiences outside of our properties using our audience data and analytics; \nCost of Revenues, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\n \nWe used $17.5 million of net cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2013, consisting of $10.7 million of additions to property and equipment, $6.7 million for payments relating to the EQAL acquisition, and $0.7 million in security deposits for additional office space. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.0 million higher than in the year ended December 31, 2012.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Application of the impairment test requires judgment and results in impairment being recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. We operate as one operating segment and one reporting unit.\n\n \u00b7 customer acquisition marketing programs, which are sold based on the number of qualified potential customers that are provided to our advertisers; \nRevenues\nCosts and Expenses\nThe following discussion provides information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, a performance measure that is not determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, as well as information regarding certain non-cash operating expenses that are reflected in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation. We use Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP operating performance measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our Board of Directors concerning our financial performance.\nOther Expense\nOperating Expenses\n \u00b7 Marketers are allocating an increasing proportion of their advertising budget to online advertising and are seeking solutions that better target their audience and maximize ROI. We believe that the ability to offer complex data-driven solutions that demonstrate ROI will be a key determinant in our success in attracting marketing dollars in the coming years. We also believe that the online percentage of the total health-related advertising market is still relatively small, and that this percentage will increase in the coming years. \nGoodwill\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe do not place undue reliance on Adjusted EBITDA as our only measure of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures, including that other companies may calculate these measures differently than we do, that they do not reflect our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures and that they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital.\nCosts and Expenses\nLoss From Discontinued Operations\n \nWe derive a significant majority of our revenues from the sale of digital advertising and sponsorship solutions that engage consumers and healthcare professionals across a variety of health categories. In recent years, we have significantly expanded our advertising and sponsorship market opportunity, diversified our customer base and increased the types of marketing solutions that we offer our customers. We specialize in providing highly-customized, data-driven solutions that can precisely target niche health audiences, and which are designed to be effective on a desktop or mobile device. We believe our customers view our data-driven digital marketing solutions as both superior to traditional media channels, which lack interactivity and the ability to measure and optimize return on investment, or ROI, in real time, and superior to other online media channels, which lack the data or technology to target the desired audience or measure the effectiveness of the campaign.\nOther expense consists of certain non-operating expenses, primarily the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and prepayment fees incurred in connection with refinancing our credit facilities.\nOur long-lived assets, in addition to goodwill discussed above, consist of property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives. These intangible assets resulted from our business acquisitions, and consist of trade names, customer relationships and agreements with certain of our website partners.\nWe also track our revenue performance across consumer, professional and payer/provider as customers may purchase a suite of Everyday Health solutions that incorporate licensing, media and other creative services. For example, with our hospital customers, we generate SaaS revenue from licensing our platform and advertising revenue from implementing marketing programs for the same hospitals. In 2015, our direct to consumer revenue was 63% of total revenue, our direct to professional revenue was 33% of total revenue and our revenue from payers and providers was 4% of total revenue. We expect our direct to professional revenue and revenue from payers and providers to increase as a percentage of our total revenues in 2016 and beyond.\nWe believe that the following key trends drive our ability to continue to grow our business:\nComponents of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nPremium services revenues decreased 14.8% to $17.9 million in 2014 from $21.0 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $4.1 million decrease in subscription fee revenues to $12.9 million in 2014 from $17.0 million in 2013. The decrease in subscription fee revenues was primarily due to a decrease in our average paid subscribers per month, which resulted from a general decline in the popularity of certain of our brands. This decrease was partially offset by subscription fee revenue from a new subscription brand launched in June 2014, and higher average revenue per paid subscriber per month.\nWe calculate the fair value of each restricted stock unit award based on our stock price on the date of grant. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option and Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP\u201d) awards. As there was no public market for our common stock prior to our IPO in March 2014, and therefore a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have determined the share price volatility for awards granted based on an analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies that granted awards with substantially similar terms. The expected volatility of awards granted has been determined using an average of the historical realized volatility measures of this peer group of companies for a period of time commensurate with the expected term of the option. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar entities until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified entities are no longer similar to us. In this latter case, more suitable entities whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.\nGoodwill resulting from our acquisitions represents the excess cost over fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets of acquired businesses. The allocation of purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to definite-lived intangible assets (discussed further below).\nLoss from discontinued operations of $5.2 million in 2013 consists of a $1.3 million loss on sale and $3.9 million of operating losses attributable to the Doctor Solutions business, which was sold in November 2013.\nMedia costs consist primarily of fees paid to online publishers, Internet search companies and other media channels where we advertise our properties. These media activities are directly attributable to generating revenue, increasing the audience to the properties we operate, accumulating qualified leads, increasing the number of individuals subscribing to our premium services and growing our registered user base. Our partner royalties are generally based on the amount of revenues generated on the particular property. In some cases, we guarantee the partner a minimum annual payment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $20.0 million, consisting of net income of $12.7 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $19.7 million, including depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, amortization and write- off of deferred financing costs, partially offset by a benefit for deferred income taxes. Additionally, changes in operating assets and liabilities used $12.3 million of cash, which was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable due to higher advertising and sponsorship revenues and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of vendor payments, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\n \u00b7 The Internet and mobile devices have become indispensable for both consumers seeking to take a more active role in managing their diverse health and wellness needs and healthcare professionals striving to provide better care for their patients and manage their practices more efficiently. We believe that individuals will increasingly seek out digital content and solutions, and spend more time interacting with these digital channels, to educate themselves, directly manage and monitor their health and wellness, and make a wide array of other health-related purchase decisions, including purchasing health insurance. \nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, increase 41.1% to $5.2 million in 2015, compared to $3.7 million in 2014. The $1.5 million increase in interest expense was primarily due to a net increase in the weighted-average outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities of approximately $52.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. This increase was primarily related to additional borrowings to fund the DD and Cambridge acquisitions, coupled with, to a lesser extent, a higher interest rate in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nOperating Activities\nIn March 2015, we refinanced our debt. Under this credit facility, or the Credit Facility, with Silicon Valley Bank and certain other lenders, we maintain a revolver, with a maximum borrowing limit of $82.3 million, and also have a term loan. As of December 31, 2015, there was $66.1 million outstanding on the term loan and $45.0 million outstanding on the revolver, with $37.3 million available to be drawn on the revolver. The repayment terms for any balance outstanding on the revolver provide for quarterly interest payments, with the principal being due in full in November 2019. The repayment terms for the term loan provide for quarterly interest and principal payments, with a maturity date of November 2019. The interest rate on the revolver and the term loan is equal to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a variable rate ranging from 2.75% to 4.0% depending on our consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Facility agreement, and we are charged a commitment fee of 0.50% on the unused portion of the revolver. As of December 31, 2015, the interest rate on our Credit Facility was 4.33%. The Credit Facility contains certain financial and operational covenants with which we must comply, whether or not there are any borrowings outstanding. Such covenants include requirements to maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, each as defined in the Credit Facility, as well as restrictions on certain types of dispositions, mergers and acquisitions, indebtedness, investments, liens and capital expenditures, issuance of capital stock and our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions. We were in compliance with the financial and operational covenants of the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2015. The Credit Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our existing and future assets.\n \nDeferred revenue consists primarily of (i) subscription fees that we have collected from consumers but for which revenue has not been recognized, and (ii) revenues from advertising and sponsorship services and licensing fees that we have billed in advance of when the revenue is to be earned.\n \nOther Expense. Other expense in 2014 consisted primarily of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs totaling $2.8 million and prepayment penalties totaling $1.0 million related to the March 2014 credit facility refinancing, compared with certain non-operating expense charges totaling $0.4 million in 2013.\n \nThe timing of our revenues is affected by certain seasonal factors. Our advertising and sponsorship revenues are traditionally the lowest in the first quarter of the year, due primarily to the seasonal spend patterns of our customers, and increases thereafter with the highest advertising and sponsorship revenues in the fourth quarter of the year. As a result of these trends, our gross margin tends to be lowest in the first quarter of each calendar year, typically increasing thereafter. We anticipate that, as our revenues increase, our gross profit will continue to increase while our period-over-period gross margin may not increase commensurately.\nAdvertising and sponsorship revenues increased 23.4% to $166.5 million in 2014 from $134.9 million in 2013. The $31.6 million increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues was driven by an increase in revenue per advertiser, as compared to 2013, due to expanded relationships with existing advertisers. The increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues was also attributable to an increase in the number of advertisers that marketed their products and services on Everyday Health properties, driven by a continued focus from our sales team on generating new customer relationships.", "item_7_text": "Since our operating decisions are based on aggregating and monetizing our audience as a whole, we believe that our aggregate gross profit is an important measure of our overall performance. Additionally, some of the other costs to operate our properties, such as product development expenses, website hosting and maintenance expenses, are included in operating expenses and not reflected in our cost of revenues. As a result, we also believe that our Adjusted EBITDA is an important metric for measuring our overall financial performance (for a detailed description of Adjusted EBITDA, see Supplemental Financial Information\u201d below).\nThe following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased 35.8% to $66.9 million in 2015 from $49.3 million in 2014. The $17.6 million increase in cost of revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in royalties to our website partners and media expenses, commensurate with the overall increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues during 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase in cost of revenues also reflects increased expenses for market research incentives, direct mail marketing and fulfillment expenses related primarily to the 2014 and 2015 acquisitions referenced above. Cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased to 28.8% in 2015 from 26.7% in 2014.\n \u00b7 The pharmaceutical industry is experiencing a major shift from large mass-market blockbuster\u201d drugs to niche or specialty medications that target discrete patient populations. At the same time, dramatically-reduced sales forces and other restrictions on interacting directly with physicians have made it more difficult for pharmaceutical companies to efficiently market their products and services. As a result, we believe the need for these companies to interact with consumers and physicians more directly through digital channels will increase significantly. \nKey Trends Affecting Our Business\nOur premium services revenues include revenues generated from subscriptions sold to individuals who purchase access for a defined period of time to one or more of our properties. Our subscription services are designed to provide the consumer with the ability to access consumer health content from well-recognized sources, and to personalize or customize a specific health or wellness program. Over the last several years, we have intentionally focused more directly on increasing our advertising and sponsorship revenues and less on expanding our consumer subscription revenues. By virtue of our acquisition of Tea Leaves in August 2015, premium services revenues also include fees generated from the license of Tea Leaves' SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform to hospital systems. These licensing agreements are typically multi-year contracts with recurring licensing fees. The related custom marketing programs that are sold to hospital customers that license our SaaS platform are allocated to advertising and sponsorship revenues.\n \n \u00b7 The evolving healthcare environment is forcing many health-related companies to face new challenges and adopt, in many cases for the first time, strategies targeting consumers and healthcare professionals. We believe our large and engaged audience, premium brands and rich database of user information afford us a significant opportunity to grow our revenues as these entities, including health insurance companies, pharmacy benefit management companies and health information technology vendors, seek new ways to drive down costs, acquire new customers and utilize technology to achieve better health outcomes. \n \nInvesting Activities\nLong-Lived Assets\nPremium services revenues increased 28.2% to $22.9 million in 2015 from $17.9 million in 2014. The $5.1 million increase was primarily from an increase in revenue from our payer and provider customers, including the hospital revenue resulting from our acquisition of Tea Leaves in August 2015, and revenue earned in connection with the termination of a partner licensing agreement in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $0.9 million higher in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, resulting primarily from an increase in non-cash expenses of $14.9 million and a decrease in cash used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $10.3 million, offset by an increase in net loss of $24.3 million. The increase in non-cash expenses of $14.9 million is driven by a $10.0 million increase in the deferred income tax provision due to a one-time, non-cash tax benefit related to the DD acquisition in 2014, a $5.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization, a $1.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and a $1.4 million increase in asset impairment charges, offset by a $3.8 million decrease in amortization and write-off of deferred financing costs. The decrease in cash used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $10.3 million is mainly due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $7.4 million and other long-term liabilities of $7.2 million primarily related to acquisition earn-out accruals, partially offset by a $5.1 million increase in accounts receivable.\n (1) In addition to the principal repayments due under our Credit Facility shown above based on outstanding borrowings of $111.1 million as of December 31, 2015, interest payments of $4.8 million are due in less than 1 year, $8.6 million in 1-3 years and $4.3 million in 3-5 years when the Credit Facility matures in November 2019. For a description of our long-term debt obligations, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Sources of Liquidity and Long-Term Debt\u201d above. (2) Some of the minimum guaranteed payments are subject to reductions if specified performance metrics are not achieved by our partners with respect to our non-operated properties. (3) Purchase obligations pertain primarily to fees for third-party content, technology and other services. \n \u00b7 It is useful to exclude certain non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation and non-core operational charges, such as asset impairment and other charges and write-off of debt extinguishment costs, from Adjusted EBITDA because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not be directly correlated to the underlying performance of our business operations and these expenses can vary significantly between periods. \nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nRevenues\nOther Expense. There were no charges reflected as other expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. Other expense in 2014 consisted primarily of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs totaling $2.8 million and prepayment penalties totaling $1.0 million related to the March 2014 credit facility refinancing.\n\n \u00b7 interactive brand sponsorships, which consist of our integrated database marketing programs and sponsorships on our properties, which typically include both components that are sold based on a cost-per-impression basis (in which we are paid based on the number of advertisements we display) and components that are sold based on a cost-per-visitor basis (in which we are paid for delivering a visitor to an advertiser's website), and sometimes include a production fee; \nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including non-cash stock compensation, for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and other administrative personnel, as well as compensation expense related to acquisition earn-outs, accounting and legal professional fees and other general corporate expenses, including insurance, facilities expenses and depreciation and amortization expense pertaining to property and equipment and amortization of definite-lived intangible assets. We expect our general and administrative expenses, including accounting and legal-related expenses and insurance costs, to increase as we have transitioned to being a public company.\nWe are subject to tax at the federal, state and local level in the U.S. and in one foreign jurisdiction. Earnings from our limited non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may also be subject to U.S. income tax.\nWe carefully monitor our gross profit and gross margin because they are key indicators of our financial performance and success in aggregating and monetizing our audience across the Everyday Health properties. Gross profit is defined as total revenues minus cost of revenues. Gross margin is defined as our gross profit as a percentage of our total revenues. While we focus on the growth of both gross profit and gross margin, we may make investments from time to time that will position us for growth at the expense of gross margin.\nSources of Liquidity and Long-Term Debt\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus: interest expense, net; income tax provision (benefit); depreciation and amortization expense; stock-based compensation expense; compensation expense related to acquisition earn-out and retention bonus arrangements; write-offs of unamortized deferred financing and other debt extinguishment costs; executive transition and reduction in force charges; contract settlement charges; asset impairment and other charges; preferred stock warrant mark-to-market adjustments and loss from discontinued operations We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods. Furthermore, we believe that:\nWe incur costs to develop software for internal use and for our website and mobile applications. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, we capitalize costs, consisting principally of payroll and related benefits, third-party consultants and related charges, incurred during the application development phase of a project as well as the costs of content developed for our properties by third-party consultants which is deemed to be reference material in nature and to provide a future economic benefit. Upon completion of a project, the capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which is typically three years. We exercise judgment in determining the point at which various projects may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of capitalized costs, and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized.\nOur primary investing activities have historically consisted of additions to property and equipment, including computer hardware and software, internally-developed software, website development costs, and leasehold improvements. Additionally, our investing activities included payments made to acquire businesses.\nIn 2014 and 2015, we made the strategic decision to leverage our existing assets to generate revenue from new customer bases across the broader healthcare landscape, particularly payers and providers. Specifically, the goal was to utilize our large, highly-engaged audience, premium content and tools, and advanced data and analytics capabilities to engage and influence consumers and healthcare professionals on behalf of entities such as health insurers and hospitals. In August 2015, we acquired Tea Leaves Health, LLC, or Tea Leaves, a provider of a SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform for hospital systems to identify and engage consumers and physicians. Tea Leaves generates revenues from multi-year contracts with recurring licensing fees, as well as related custom marketing programs that drive incremental advertising revenue. We believe there is a significant revenue opportunity in providing hospital systems with marketing solutions to target both consumers and physicians and to provide measurable ROI for their strategic planning and marketing efforts.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased 31.4% to $39.5 million in 2015 from $30.0 million in 2014. This $9.5 million increase was attributable to several factors, including: (i) an increase in amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets relating to the DD and Cambridge acquisitions; (ii) higher levels of non-cash stock compensation expense; (iii) accrued executive transition charges totaling $1.3 million for the separation of certain of our executives during 2015; and (iv) higher professional services fee expenses, which include additional expenses related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to 17.0% in 2015, as compared to 16.3% in 2014.\nBackground Information\nWe used $63.2 million of net cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015, consisting of $14.5 million of additions to property and equipment, $47.3 million for purchase price payments relating to the Cambridge and Tea Leaves acquisitions and $1.4 million for security deposits and other assets. Net cash used in investing activities was $16.0 million lower than in the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to lower purchase price payments in 2015 compared to 2014.\n (1) Stock compensation expense includes charges related to the Company's ESPP beginning in 2014. Refer to Note 11-Stock-Based Compensation\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe generally recognize licensing revenue over the life of the contract.\n(Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes. The (provision) benefit for income taxes was approximately $8.7 million and $(1.1) million during the years 2014 and 2013, respectively. For 2014, the benefit for income taxes includes a one-time tax benefit of $10.0 million associated with the re-measurement of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets related to the DD acquisition. The remaining provision in 2014 and 2013 pertains primarily to deferred income taxes related to basis differences in indefinite lived intangible assets that could not be offset by current year deferred tax assets, as well as the current provision for state income taxes.\nRevenues\nThese amounts consist principally of interest expense, partially offset by interest income, as well as amortization expense related to deferred financing costs. Interest expense is primarily related to our credit facilities.\n \n \u00b7 royalty payments to our partners; and \nSoftware and website development costs that do not meet the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred and are included in product development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOur primary sources of cash have historically been proceeds from the issuance of convertible redeemable preferred stock, bank borrowings and our IPO. Since the beginning of 2003, we have issued convertible redeemable preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of $82.0 million, which were converted to common stock upon the IPO on April 2, 2014. Our IPO resulted in net proceeds of $70.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs. As of December 31, 2015, we had $111.1 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility.\nWe expect our advertising and sponsorship revenues to increase in 2016. We expect our premium services revenue to decrease in 2016, as the increase in hospital SaaS revenue will be offset by the decline in consumer subscription revenues.\nOn February 26, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility, which effected certain modifications to the financial covenants and terms set forth in the Credit Facility. In addition, on March 2, 2016, we drew $15.0 million under the revolver portion of the Credit Facility. As of March 2, 2016, there was $64.4 million outstanding on the term loan and $60.0 million outstanding on the revolver, with $22.3 million available to be drawn on the revolver.\nWe generated $93.7 million of net cash in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily from $70.6 million received from the net proceeds upon the closing of our IPO, $7.9 million received upon the exercise of stock option awards and $18.7 million of additional net borrowings under our revolver and term loan credit facilities, partially offset by $2.9 million of related financing costs. Net cash provided by financing activities was $85.5 million higher than in the year ended December 31, 2013.\nSupplemental Financial Information\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n \nIn April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued amended guidance for reporting discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, only disposals that represent a strategic shift having a material impact on an entity's operations and financial results shall be reported as discontinued operations, with expanded disclosures. This amendment will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2015. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of this guidance to be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance for revenue recognition. This amendment provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model. The core principle of the guidance is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The amendment was originally to be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In August 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral of the effective date to December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the effect that the new standard will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nWe expect our gross profit to continue to improve in the near term as we continue to aggregate our audience more efficiently and enhance our monetization capabilities. While we expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase on an absolute basis in the foreseeable future, we do not believe that any such increases will negatively impact our gross profit or Adjusted EBITDA since we anticipate that the growth in our total revenues will continue to exceed the increase in our cost of revenues on a year-over-year basis.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance on stock compensation accounting requiring that a performance target that affects vesting and could be achieved after the requisite service period should be treated as a performance condition. Current GAAP does not contain explicit guidance on how to account for such share-based payments. This updated guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of this guidance to be material to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe generated $8.2 million of net cash in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily from $11.5 million of additional borrowings under our credit facility partially offset by $2.8 million of principal repayments under our term loan credit facility. Net cash provided by financing activities was $12.8 million lower than in the year ended December 31, 2012.\nWe generated $21.6 million of net cash in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily from $15.0 million in net borrowings on the revolver portion of our credit facility, $6.1 million of borrowings on the term loan portion of the facility net of principal repayments and $2.6 million received upon the exercise of stock option awards, partially offset by capital lease obligations, financing costs and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of restricted stock units. Net cash provided by financing activities was $72.0 million lower than in the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the $70.6 million net proceeds we received upon the closing of our IPO in 2014.\nAs Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, the following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. The new guidance requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. This guidance will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2016 on a retrospective basis for all periods presented, with early adoption optional. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of this guidance to be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe typically recognize advertising revenues in the period in which the advertisement is delivered. Our revenues from sponsorship services and marketing programs are recognized over the period in which we substantially satisfy our contractual obligations set forth in the relevant sponsorship agreements. When contractual arrangements contain multiple elements, revenue is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value determined using prices charged when elements are sold separately. In instances where individual deliverables are not sold separately, or when third-party evidence is not available, fair value is determined based on our best estimate of selling price. Advertising and sponsorship revenues accounted for 90.1%, 90.3% and 86.6% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $30.1 million and working capital of $59.2 million.\n\nIn addition, stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant, based on our historical forfeiture experience, and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\n \u00b7 marketing programs that provide for revenues based upon the ROI we deliver for our customers, primarily pharmaceutical customers; and \n\n \nOur total revenues increased 25.9% to $232.0 million in 2015 from $184.3 million in 2014. The $47.7 million increase in total revenues consisted of a $42.6 million increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues and a $5.1 million increase in premium services revenues. No advertiser accounted for 10% or more of total revenues in 2015 or 2014.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased 53.8% to $74.8 million in 2015 from $48.6 million in 2014. This $26.2 million increase was attributable to several factors including: (i) higher cash and non-cash stock compensation expense for the increased staffing in our sales, sales development, sales operations and data analytics departments, which also includes the additional sales-related personnel acquired through the DD and Cambridge acquisitions in 2015; (ii) accrued earn-out and retention bonuses totaling $7.2 million related to the Cambridge, Tea Leaves and DD acquisitions and (iii) accrued executive transition charges and reduction in force severance charges, totaling $2.2 million, for the separation of certain of our executives during 2015. As a result of these factors, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to 32.2% in 2015, as compared to 26.4% in 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nIn November 2013, we sold our Doctor Solutions business, which provided local online directories, search engine marketing and other marketing services to healthcare professionals. The sale represented a disposal of a component of an entity whose operations and cash flows were eliminated from our ongoing business after the sale. As such, the operating results of this business have been reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe expected life of options granted has been determined utilizing the simplified method for determining the expected life for options qualifying for treatment due to the limited history we have with option exercise activity. The expected term for ESPP shares is based on the purchase period. The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods equal to the expected term of the awards on the grant date. We have not paid, and do not anticipate paying, cash dividends on our shares of common stock, and the expected dividend yield is, therefore, assumed to be zero.\nIn March 2015, we expanded our ability to service pharmaceutical companies through the acquisition of Cambridge BioMarketing Group, LLC, or Cambridge, a provider of strategic launch and marketing solutions for orphan and rare disease products. Following this acquisition, we believe that our platform can service our pharmaceutical partners across the entire spectrum of therapeutic areas, including orphan, specialty and mass market brands, as well as provide solutions throughout the entire lifecycle of pharmaceutical marketing, from the strategic phase of pre-launch, during the growth years and beyond the loss of patent exclusivity.\nMore specifically, our advertising and sponsorship solutions include, among others:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased 13.7% to $49.3 million in 2014 from $43.3 million in 2013. The $6.0 million increase in cost of revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in royalties to our partners commensurate with the increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues. Cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 26.7% in 2014 from 27.8% in 2013.\n \u00b7 display advertisements on our properties and in our free e-mail newsletters, which are primarily sold based on a cost-per-impression advertising model; \nWe generate revenues primarily through advertising and sponsorships, and premium services, including subscriptions and licensing fees.\nThe assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. The assumptions we used in the Black-Scholes pricing model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment. If any of the assumptions used in this pricing model change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially from the awards granted previously. Additionally, the pricing model fair value of the awards is based upon the fair value of our underlying common stock.\nFinancing Activities\n \nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are often based on judgments that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made, but all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions and it is possible that other professionals, applying their own judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support alternative estimates and assumptions that would result in material changes to our operating results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $20.9 million, consisting of a net (loss) of $(11.6) million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $34.6 million, including depreciation and amortization, provision for doubtful accounts, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, asset impairment charge, amortization and write-off of deferred financing costs and provision for deferred income taxes. Additionally, changes in operating assets and liabilities used $2.1 million of cash, which was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $17.5 million due to higher advertising and sponsorship revenues, offset by an increase in long-term liabilities of $7.8 million primarily related to acquisition earn-out accruals, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $5.4 million due to the timing of vendor payments, and an increase in deferred revenue of $1.2 million.\nAdvertising and sponsorship revenues increased 25.6% to $209.1 million in 2015 from $166.5 million in 2014. The $42.6 million increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from our pharmaceutical customers, including programs for orphan, rare and specialty diseases and ROI-based campaigns for mature brands. Our acquisitions of DD in the fourth quarter of 2014 and Cambridge in the first quarter of 2015 significantly enhanced the solutions we can offer to pharmaceutical customers.\nComparison of Years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased 9.5% to $48.6 million in 2014 from $44.4 million in 2013. This $4.2 million increase was primarily due to higher levels of compensation expense, including increased staffing and related cash and non-cash stock compensation expense for the sales development, sales operations and data analytics teams associated with generating and supporting increased advertising and sponsorship revenues in 2014 compared to 2013, partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in acquisition earn-out expense in 2014 compared to 2013. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 26.4% in 2014, as compared to 28.5% in 2013.\nResults of Operations\nThe Everyday Health platform provides digital marketing and communications solutions that engage consumers and healthcare professionals across a variety of health categories. Cost of revenues consists primarily of the expenses associated with aggregating the total audience across the Everyday Health properties or delivering an audience to fulfill a marketing campaign. These costs include:\nOur financing activities have historically consisted of borrowings and repayments under our credit facilities, and related financing costs, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. In addition to such activities, upon closing our IPO in April 2014, we received proceeds from our IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and related offering costs.\nWe recognized revenue only when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) the service is performed; and (iv) collectability of the related fee is reasonably assured. While the majority of our revenue transactions are based on standard business terms and conditions, we also enter into non-standard sales agreements with advertisers that sometimes involve multiple elements.\nPrior to late 2010, our primary focus was on offering content and tools to consumers and selling marketing solutions targeting only health consumers. In late 2010, we made a strategic decision to expand our business into the market for providing content and marketing solutions targeting healthcare professionals through our acquisition of MedPage Holdings, Inc., or MPT. We believe that the entry into the healthcare professional market provided us with a significant revenue opportunity because pharmaceutical companies spend a larger percentage of their marketing budgets targeting healthcare professionals as compared to consumers.\n \nIn September 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on business combinations accounting requiring the acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Previously, such adjustments were required to be retrospectively recorded in prior period financial information. The amended guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The standard is to be applied prospectively, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of this guidance to be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nProduct Development. Product development expenses increased 1.8% to $44.5 million in 2014 from $43.8 million in 2013. This $0.8 million increase in product development expenses was primarily due to increases in cash and non-cash stock compensation expense, partially offset by a $1.2 million impairment charge in 2013 pertaining to website content and tools which did not recur in 2014. Product development expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 24.2% in 2014, as compared to 28.1% in 2013.\n \u00b7 media costs; \nBoth our revenues and gross profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year periods, as shown in the table below.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods presented. The period-to-period comparisons of the results are not necessarily indicative of our results for future periods.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance on balance sheet classification of deferred taxes, requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The classification change for all deferred taxes as non-current simplifies entities' processes as it eliminates the need to separately identify the net current and net non-current deferred tax asset or liability in each jurisdiction and allocate valuation allowances. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with earlier application permitted. We elected to early adopt this guidance on a retrospective basis effective December 31, 2014. As a result of the retrospective adoption, the Company reclassified $0.7 million from current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax liabilities in the 2014 balance sheet.\nWorking Capital\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $104.0 million of U.S. federal and state net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. The U.S. federal NOL carryforwards will expire from 2026 through 2033. The full utilization of these NOL carryforwards in the future will be dependent upon our ability to generate taxable income and could be limited due to ownership changes, as defined under the provisions of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Specifically, Section 382 contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to use its previously-recognized NOL carryforwards and specified built-in losses in years after the ownership change. We completed an analysis in 2015 to determine the impact that past ownership changes may have on our ability to use our NOL carryforwards and have determined that, through 2015, there is no Section 382 limitation on our NOL carryforwards as there has not been a change in ownership of more than 50% over the three-year period through 2015. Our NOLs may also be limited under similar provisions of state law. The NOL carryforwards at December 31, 2015 include approximately $7.5 million in income tax deductions related to equity compensation, which will be reflected as a credit to additional paid-in-capital as these NOLs are utilized.\nThe following table summarizes our depreciation and amortization and stock compensation expenses included in the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table above and details the breakdown of such expenses in the respective statements of operations line-items.\n \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA provides investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, helps indicate underlying trends in our business, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations and comparisons with our peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results; and \nComparison of Years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nIn late 2014, we expanded further into the healthcare professional sector with the acquisition of DoctorDirectory.com, Inc., or DD, a provider of multi-channel marketing solutions for pharmaceutical brands seeking to influence healthcare professionals. The acquisition of DD helped deepen our penetration into the healthcare professional market by significantly increasing our physician audience and enhancing our sophisticated ROI-based marketing solutions that we offer advertisers seeking to engage with healthcare professionals.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $18.4 million higher in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, resulting primarily from an increase in net income of $31.1 million, an increase in non-cash stock based compensation of $6.1 million, and a $4.2 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $9.5 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of vendor invoice payments and a $10.0 million decrease in the deferred income tax provision due to a one-time, non-cash tax benefit related to the DD acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.\n(Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes. The (provision) benefit for income taxes was approximately $(1.3) million and $8.7 million during the years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The provision for income taxes in 2015 pertains primarily to deferred income taxes relating to basis differences in indefinite-lived intangible assets that cannot be offset by current year deferred tax assets since its reversal is considered indefinite in nature. Deferred income taxes increased in 2015 by $0.6 million in connection with our 2015 acquisitions, offset by a one-time tax benefit of $0.6 million related to the release of a valuation allowance from finalizing the purchase price valuation of the DD acquisition from 2014. For 2014, the deferred benefit for income taxes includes a one-time tax benefit of $10.0 million associated with the re-measurement of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets related to the DD acquisition, partially offset by a deferred tax charge relating to basis differences in indefinite-lived intangible assets as described above. The remaining provision in 2015 and 2014 pertains primarily to the current provision for federal minimum tax and state and local income taxes.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe recognize subscription revenues ratably over the relevant subscription periods, which for our SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform are typically over the multi-year contract term and for subscriptions sold to individuals are predominantly quarterly, after deducting refunds and charge-backs. For the SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform, customers are typically charged a fee to integrate the platform which is recognized over the contract term and a recurring license fee which is billed monthly. For subscriptions to individuals, we typically charge each subscriber's credit card for the full price for their subscription at the commencement of the subscription period and at each subscription renewal date, unless the consumer cancels the subscription prior to the renewal date. When consumers sign up for free-trial subscriptions, we automatically charge their credit card for a subscription at the end of the free-trial period unless they cancel before the trial period ends. Once billed, the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis, over the subscription period. No revenue is recognized ratably over, or allocated to, the free-trial period.\nWe believe the following reflects our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe account for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the current authoritative accounting guidance, under which stock-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, are measured at fair value as of the grant date and recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period), which we have elected to amortize using the graded attribution method.\nWe operate a leading digital marketing and communications platform for healthcare marketers seeking to engage and influence consumers and healthcare professionals. We combine premium health and wellness content with sophisticated proprietary data and analytics tools to enable healthcare marketers to communicate with our large audience of consumers and healthcare professionals. During 2015, our customers included five of the top ten global advertisers in 2014, as compiled by Advertising Age, 24 of the top 25 global pharmaceutical companies ranked by 2014 revenue, and more than 350 hospitals across 30 states, including six of the top ten largest health systems in the U.S.\nThe evaluation of our goodwill annually on October 1 indicated that the carrying value of the asset was less than the fair value and, accordingly, there was no impairment loss recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe amount assigned to our definite-lived intangible assets is a subjective analysis based on our estimates of the future benefit of these assets using acceptable valuation techniques. The estimated fair values assigned to our trade names and other definite-lived intangible assets are computed based on discounted cash flows using the Relief From Royalty Method and Excess Earnings Method, respectively, which applies various assumptions developed by management, including projected revenues, operating margins, attrition rates, royalty rates and discount rates.\n \nWe perform an initial qualitative analysis to evaluate whether any events and circumstances occurred or exist that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further assessment of the reporting unit's goodwill is necessary. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the goodwill must be tested using a two-step quantitative process, and if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.\n \u00b7 marketing programs that are sold based on a time and materials basis. \nAlthough we typically do not distinguish between desktop and mobile channels in the structuring and pricing of our marketing campaigns, mobile channels have become increasingly important in fulfilling these campaigns as overall mobile traffic has increased. Revenues delivered via mobile channels increased 8.1% to $73.1 million in 2015 from $67.7 million in 2014.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon technical merits, it is more-likely-than-not\u201d that the position will be sustained upon examination. Potential interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions are recognized in income tax expense.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased 9.4% to $30.0 million in 2014 from $27.5 million in 2013. This $2.6 million increase was primarily due to increases in cash and non-cash stock compensation expense and professional service fee expenses, attributed in part to being public in 2014, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in amortization expense related to intangible assets. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 16.3% in 2014, as compared to 17.6% in 2013.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\nOur property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets are depreciated and amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally three to five years for property and equipment and three to ten years for definite-lived intangible assets, which are determined based on several factors, primarily the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service and provide benefit to us. We review these definite-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2015, an impairment charge of $1,416 was recorded related to certain software development projects included in property and equipment, which we decided not to move forward with. There were no indicators of impairment of these definite-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded impairment charges of $1.2 million related to certain website costs included in property and equipment.\nThe components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. We reduce the measurement of a deferred tax asset, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize some or all of the deferred tax asset. As a result of our historical operating performance and the cumulative net losses incurred to date, we do not have sufficient objective evidence to support the recovery of the net deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we have established a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets for financial reporting purposes because we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and one foreign jurisdiction. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the tax and financial statement reporting basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nInterest Expense, Net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 million, consisting of cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of $5.9 million offset by cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations of $4.2 million. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of $5.9 million consisted of a loss from continuing operations of $13.0 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $23.0 million, including depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Additionally, changes in operating assets and liabilities used $4.1 million of cash, which was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable due to higher advertising and sponsorship revenues and in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by an increase in (i) accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of vendor payments and (ii) deferred revenue related to certain marketing campaigns and premium services billed in advance of the services being provided. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations of $4.2 million consisted of a loss from discontinued operations of $5.2 million adjusted for non-cash items, primarily the write-off of certain assets in connection with the sale.\n \nWe do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, as part of our ongoing business. Accordingly, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows are not subject to off-balance sheet risks.\n \u00b7 to a lesser extent, market research incentives, direct mail marketing and fulfillment costs, as well as costs associated with subscription fees for our premium services, ad serving and other expenses. \n \nInternal Software and Website Development Cost\nAdvertising and sponsorship revenues constitute a significant majority of our total revenues. We also generate revenues from premium services, which consist primarily of digital subscriptions sold to consumers and fees from hospitals for licensing our SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, decreased 56.0% to $3.7 million in 2014, compared to $8.4 million in 2013. The $4.7 million decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the refinancing of our credit facility in March 2014 at a lower interest rate in 2014 compared with 2013, and to a net decrease in the weighted-average outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on leases which, for operating leases, requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in its balance sheet. The standard also requires a lessee to recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term, on a generally straight-line basis. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. We are currently evaluating the effects of the adoption and have not yet determined the impact the revised guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nOur total revenues increased 18.3% to $184.3 million in 2014 from $155.9 million in 2013. The $28.5 million increase in total revenues consisted of a $31.6 million increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in premium services revenues. No advertiser accounted for 10% or more of total revenues in 2014. In 2013, one advertiser accounted for approximately 12% of total revenues.\nProduct Development. Product development expenses increased 25.5% to $55.9 million in 2015 from $44.5 million in 2014. This $11.4 million increase in product development expenses was primarily due to accrued earn-out expense totaling $4.1 million related to the acquisition of Tea Leaves in 2015 and a $1.4 million asset impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2015 related to certain software development projects which we decided not to move forward with, as well as $2.0 million increased depreciation expense on product development related assets, primarily from the DD acquisition. Product development expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 24.1% in 2015, as compared to 24.2% in 2014.\nOur principal uses of cash historically have been to fund operating losses, finance business acquisitions and capital expenditures relating to purchases of property and equipment to support our infrastructure and capitalized product development costs. We currently expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our marketing solutions, including the impact of changes in advertiser spending behavior, and by other factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions, as well as the other risks to our business discussed under Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d Our cash requirements going forward may require us to raise additional funds through borrowing or the issuance of additional equity or equity-linked securities. Any increase in the amount of our borrowings will result in an increase in our interest expense. Future issuance of equity or equity-linked securities will result in dilution to the holders of our common stock. In addition, if the banking system or the financial markets are volatile, our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital could be adversely affected. Additional financing may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIncome Taxes\n\nOverview\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including commissions and non-cash stock compensation, for our sales and account management, research, marketing, data analytics and creative design personnel, as well as compensation expense related to acquisition earn-outs and retention bonuses, fees for third-party professional marketing and analytical services and depreciation and amortization expense pertaining to property and equipment. Our sales and marketing departments include data analytics personnel that analyze traffic and advertising ROI data to determine the effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we increase the number of sales, sales support, marketing and analytical personnel.\nProduct Development. Product development expenses consist primarily of costs related to the products and services we provide to our audience, including the costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our website properties. These costs primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, including non-cash stock compensation, for our editorial, product management, technology and customer service personnel, and compensation expense related to acquisition earn-outs. Product development expenses also include fees paid to editorial and technology consultants; other technology costs incurred for maintenance to our technology platforms and infrastructure; depreciation and amortization expense pertaining to property and equipment and capitalized technology costs, including website and mobile development costs and acquired technology assets; and impairments of product development assets when such assets are no longer expected to provide future benefit. We expect our investment in product development to increase as we continue to increase our editorial, product development and technology resources, and as we enhance our product offerings by creating and licensing content, tools and applications, including new offerings for payers and providers.\nGiven the size and scope of our content and audience assets, we offer a variety of advertising and sponsorship solutions that engage consumers and healthcare professionals across a variety of health categories. Our diverse customer base for these marketing solutions consists primarily of pharmaceutical companies, manufacturers and retailers of over-the-counter products and consumer-packaged-goods, and, to a lesser extent, healthcare providers, such as hospital systems, and health insurers. Pharmaceutical companies represent our largest customer group. In addition to offering a wide range of marketing solutions, we also utilize a variety of revenue models depending on the specific needs and profile of the customer. For example, we may price our marketing solutions on (i) a fixed fee basis, (ii) a cost-per-impression (CPM) or cost-per-visitor (CPV) basis, or (iii) the ROI we deliver from a specific campaign. An increasing number of our marketing programs provide for revenues to us based primarily upon the ROI we deliver, such as the increase in prescription activity for a pharmaceutical product.\nTo a lesser extent, we generate revenues from the sale of our premium services, which consist primarily of (i) fees from hospitals for licensing our SaaS-based marketing and analytics platform and (ii) digital subscriptions sold to consumers for access to our consumer diet and fitness properties. In recent years, we have intentionally decreased our focus on generating revenues from consumer subscriptions and this trend will continue in 2016.\nWe used $79.2 million of net cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014, consisting of $14.8 million of additions to property and equipment and $65.0 million for purchase price payments relating to the DD acquisition. Net cash used in investing activities was $61.7 million higher than in the year ended December 31, 2013.\n \u00b7 programs that allow marketers the opportunity to target specific audiences outside of our properties using our audience data and analytics; \nCost of Revenues, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\n \nWe used $17.5 million of net cash in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2013, consisting of $10.7 million of additions to property and equipment, $6.7 million for payments relating to the EQAL acquisition, and $0.7 million in security deposits for additional office space. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.0 million higher than in the year ended December 31, 2012.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Application of the impairment test requires judgment and results in impairment being recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. We operate as one operating segment and one reporting unit.\n\n \u00b7 customer acquisition marketing programs, which are sold based on the number of qualified potential customers that are provided to our advertisers; \nRevenues\nCosts and Expenses\nThe following discussion provides information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, a performance measure that is not determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, as well as information regarding certain non-cash operating expenses that are reflected in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation. We use Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP operating performance measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our Board of Directors concerning our financial performance.\nOther Expense\nOperating Expenses\n \u00b7 Marketers are allocating an increasing proportion of their advertising budget to online advertising and are seeking solutions that better target their audience and maximize ROI. We believe that the ability to offer complex data-driven solutions that demonstrate ROI will be a key determinant in our success in attracting marketing dollars in the coming years. We also believe that the online percentage of the total health-related advertising market is still relatively small, and that this percentage will increase in the coming years. \nGoodwill\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe do not place undue reliance on Adjusted EBITDA as our only measure of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures, including that other companies may calculate these measures differently than we do, that they do not reflect our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures and that they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital.\nCosts and Expenses\nLoss From Discontinued Operations\n \nWe derive a significant majority of our revenues from the sale of digital advertising and sponsorship solutions that engage consumers and healthcare professionals across a variety of health categories. In recent years, we have significantly expanded our advertising and sponsorship market opportunity, diversified our customer base and increased the types of marketing solutions that we offer our customers. We specialize in providing highly-customized, data-driven solutions that can precisely target niche health audiences, and which are designed to be effective on a desktop or mobile device. We believe our customers view our data-driven digital marketing solutions as both superior to traditional media channels, which lack interactivity and the ability to measure and optimize return on investment, or ROI, in real time, and superior to other online media channels, which lack the data or technology to target the desired audience or measure the effectiveness of the campaign.\nOther expense consists of certain non-operating expenses, primarily the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and prepayment fees incurred in connection with refinancing our credit facilities.\nOur long-lived assets, in addition to goodwill discussed above, consist of property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives. These intangible assets resulted from our business acquisitions, and consist of trade names, customer relationships and agreements with certain of our website partners.\nWe also track our revenue performance across consumer, professional and payer/provider as customers may purchase a suite of Everyday Health solutions that incorporate licensing, media and other creative services. For example, with our hospital customers, we generate SaaS revenue from licensing our platform and advertising revenue from implementing marketing programs for the same hospitals. In 2015, our direct to consumer revenue was 63% of total revenue, our direct to professional revenue was 33% of total revenue and our revenue from payers and providers was 4% of total revenue. We expect our direct to professional revenue and revenue from payers and providers to increase as a percentage of our total revenues in 2016 and beyond.\nWe believe that the following key trends drive our ability to continue to grow our business:\nComponents of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nPremium services revenues decreased 14.8% to $17.9 million in 2014 from $21.0 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $4.1 million decrease in subscription fee revenues to $12.9 million in 2014 from $17.0 million in 2013. The decrease in subscription fee revenues was primarily due to a decrease in our average paid subscribers per month, which resulted from a general decline in the popularity of certain of our brands. This decrease was partially offset by subscription fee revenue from a new subscription brand launched in June 2014, and higher average revenue per paid subscriber per month.\nWe calculate the fair value of each restricted stock unit award based on our stock price on the date of grant. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option and Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP\u201d) awards. As there was no public market for our common stock prior to our IPO in March 2014, and therefore a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have determined the share price volatility for awards granted based on an analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies that granted awards with substantially similar terms. The expected volatility of awards granted has been determined using an average of the historical realized volatility measures of this peer group of companies for a period of time commensurate with the expected term of the option. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar entities until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified entities are no longer similar to us. In this latter case, more suitable entities whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.\nGoodwill resulting from our acquisitions represents the excess cost over fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets of acquired businesses. The allocation of purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to definite-lived intangible assets (discussed further below).\nLoss from discontinued operations of $5.2 million in 2013 consists of a $1.3 million loss on sale and $3.9 million of operating losses attributable to the Doctor Solutions business, which was sold in November 2013.\nMedia costs consist primarily of fees paid to online publishers, Internet search companies and other media channels where we advertise our properties. These media activities are directly attributable to generating revenue, increasing the audience to the properties we operate, accumulating qualified leads, increasing the number of individuals subscribing to our premium services and growing our registered user base. Our partner royalties are generally based on the amount of revenues generated on the particular property. In some cases, we guarantee the partner a minimum annual payment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $20.0 million, consisting of net income of $12.7 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $19.7 million, including depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, amortization and write- off of deferred financing costs, partially offset by a benefit for deferred income taxes. Additionally, changes in operating assets and liabilities used $12.3 million of cash, which was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable due to higher advertising and sponsorship revenues and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of vendor payments, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\n \u00b7 The Internet and mobile devices have become indispensable for both consumers seeking to take a more active role in managing their diverse health and wellness needs and healthcare professionals striving to provide better care for their patients and manage their practices more efficiently. We believe that individuals will increasingly seek out digital content and solutions, and spend more time interacting with these digital channels, to educate themselves, directly manage and monitor their health and wellness, and make a wide array of other health-related purchase decisions, including purchasing health insurance. \nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, increase 41.1% to $5.2 million in 2015, compared to $3.7 million in 2014. The $1.5 million increase in interest expense was primarily due to a net increase in the weighted-average outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities of approximately $52.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. This increase was primarily related to additional borrowings to fund the DD and Cambridge acquisitions, coupled with, to a lesser extent, a higher interest rate in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nOperating Activities\nIn March 2015, we refinanced our debt. Under this credit facility, or the Credit Facility, with Silicon Valley Bank and certain other lenders, we maintain a revolver, with a maximum borrowing limit of $82.3 million, and also have a term loan. As of December 31, 2015, there was $66.1 million outstanding on the term loan and $45.0 million outstanding on the revolver, with $37.3 million available to be drawn on the revolver. The repayment terms for any balance outstanding on the revolver provide for quarterly interest payments, with the principal being due in full in November 2019. The repayment terms for the term loan provide for quarterly interest and principal payments, with a maturity date of November 2019. The interest rate on the revolver and the term loan is equal to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a variable rate ranging from 2.75% to 4.0% depending on our consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Facility agreement, and we are charged a commitment fee of 0.50% on the unused portion of the revolver. As of December 31, 2015, the interest rate on our Credit Facility was 4.33%. The Credit Facility contains certain financial and operational covenants with which we must comply, whether or not there are any borrowings outstanding. Such covenants include requirements to maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, each as defined in the Credit Facility, as well as restrictions on certain types of dispositions, mergers and acquisitions, indebtedness, investments, liens and capital expenditures, issuance of capital stock and our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions. We were in compliance with the financial and operational covenants of the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2015. The Credit Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our existing and future assets.\n \nDeferred revenue consists primarily of (i) subscription fees that we have collected from consumers but for which revenue has not been recognized, and (ii) revenues from advertising and sponsorship services and licensing fees that we have billed in advance of when the revenue is to be earned.\n \nOther Expense. Other expense in 2014 consisted primarily of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs totaling $2.8 million and prepayment penalties totaling $1.0 million related to the March 2014 credit facility refinancing, compared with certain non-operating expense charges totaling $0.4 million in 2013.\n \nThe timing of our revenues is affected by certain seasonal factors. Our advertising and sponsorship revenues are traditionally the lowest in the first quarter of the year, due primarily to the seasonal spend patterns of our customers, and increases thereafter with the highest advertising and sponsorship revenues in the fourth quarter of the year. As a result of these trends, our gross margin tends to be lowest in the first quarter of each calendar year, typically increasing thereafter. We anticipate that, as our revenues increase, our gross profit will continue to increase while our period-over-period gross margin may not increase commensurately.\nAdvertising and sponsorship revenues increased 23.4% to $166.5 million in 2014 from $134.9 million in 2013. The $31.6 million increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues was driven by an increase in revenue per advertiser, as compared to 2013, due to expanded relationships with existing advertisers. The increase in advertising and sponsorship revenues was also attributable to an increase in the number of advertisers that marketed their products and services on Everyday Health properties, driven by a continued focus from our sales team on generating new customer relationships.", "item_7_tables": "Table 168: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
