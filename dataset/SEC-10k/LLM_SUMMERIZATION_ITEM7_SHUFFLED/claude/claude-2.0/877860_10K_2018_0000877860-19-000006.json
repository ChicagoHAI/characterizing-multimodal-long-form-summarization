MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of National Health Investors, Inc. for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other important factors are identified in Item 1. Business\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d above.\nExecutive Overview\nNational Health Investors, Inc., established in 1991 as a Maryland corporation, is a self-managed REIT specializing in sale-leaseback, joint-venture, mortgage and mezzanine financing of need-driven and discretionary senior housing and medical investments. Our portfolio consists of lease, mortgage and other note investments in independent living facilities, assisted living facilities, entrance-fee communities, senior living campuses, skilled nursing facilities, specialty hospitals and medical office buildings. Other investments have included marketable securities and, until 2016, a joint venture structured to comply with the provisions of the REIT Investment Diversification Empowerment Act of 2007 ( RIDEA\u201d) through which we invested in facility operations managed by an independent third-party. We have funded our real estate investments primarily through: (1) operating cash flow, (2) debt offerings, including bank lines of credit and term debt, both unsecured and secured, and (3) the sale of equity securities.\nPortfolio\nAt December 31, 2018, we had investments in real estate, mortgage and other notes receivable involving 232 facilities located in 33 states. These investments involve 151 senior housing properties, 76 skilled nursing facilities, 3 hospitals, 2 medical office buildings and other notes receivable. These investments (excluding our corporate office of $2,471,000) consisted of properties with an original cost of $2,815,894,000, rented under triple-net leases to 30 lessees, and $246,111,000 aggregate carrying value of mortgage and other notes receivable due from 10 borrowers.\nWe classify the properties in our portfolio as either senior housing or medical properties. We further classify our senior housing properties as either need-driven (assisted living facilities and senior living campuses) or discretionary (independent living facilities and entrance-fee communities). Medical properties within our portfolio include skilled nursing facilities, medical office buildings and specialty hospitals.\nThe following tables summarize our investments in real estate and mortgage and other notes receivable as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate Properties\n</td> <td>Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beds/Sq.

We seek tenants who will become mission-oriented partners in relationships where our business goals are aligned. This approach aims to fuel steady, and thus, enduring growth for those partners and for NHI. Within the context of our growth model, we rely on a cost-effective access to debt and equity capital to finance acquisitions that will drive our earnings. There is significant competition for healthcare assets from other REITs, both public and private, and from private equity sources. Large-scale portfolios continue to command premium pricing, due to the continued abundance of private and foreign buyers seeking to invest in healthcare real estate. This combination of circumstances places a premium on our ability to execute acquisitions and negotiate leases that will generate meaningful earnings growth for our shareholders. We emphasize growth with our existing tenants and borrowers as a way to insulate us from other competition.\nWith lower capitalization rates for existing healthcare facilities, there has been increased interest in constructing new facilities in hopes of generating better returns on invested capital. Using our relationship-driven model, we continue to look for opportunities to support new and existing tenants and borrowers with the capital needed to expand existing facilities and to initiate ground-up development of new facilities. We concentrate our efforts in those markets where there is both a demonstrated demand for a particular product type and where we perceive we have a competitive advantage. The projects we agree to finance have attractive upside potential and are expected to provide above-average returns to our shareholders to mitigate the risks inherent with property development and construction.\nFollowing three 25 basis-point increases in 2017, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve announced four further increases during 2018. As inflation is expected to rise, officials have forecast a total of two increases in 2019. However, the actual path the federal funds rate takes will depend on the changing economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The anticipation of past and further increases in the federal funds rate in 2018 and beyond has been a primary source of much volatility in REIT equity markets. As a result, there will be pressure on the spread between our cost of capital and the returns we earn. We expect that pressure to be partially mitigated by market forces that would tend to result in higher capitalization rates for healthcare assets and higher lease rates indicative of historical levels. Our cost of capital has increased over the past year as we transition some of our short term revolving borrowings into debt instruments with longer maturities and fixed interest rates. Managing long-term risk involves trade-offs with the competing alternative goal of maximizing short-term profitability. Our intention is to strike an appropriate balance between these competing interests within the context of our investor profile. As interest rates rise, our share price may decline as investors adjust prices to reflect a dividend yield that is sufficiently in excess of a risk-free rate.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 27% of our revenue was derived from operators of our skilled nursing facilities that receive a significant portion of their revenue from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. Such revenues are subject annually to statutory and regulatory changes and in recent years have been reduced due to federal and state budgetary pressures. Over the past five years, we have selectively diversified our portfolio by directing a significant portion of our investments into properties which do not rely primarily on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, but rather on private pay sources (assisted living and memory care facilities, senior living campuses, independent living facilities and entrance-fee communities). We will occasionally acquire skilled nursing facilities in good physical condition with a proven operator and strong local market fundamentals, because diversification implies a periodic rebalancing, but our recent investment focus has been on acquiring need-driven and discretionary senior housing assets.\nFor individual tenant revenue as a percentage of total lease revenue, Bickford is our largest assisted living tenant, an affiliate of Holiday is our largest independent living tenant, NHC is our largest skilled nursing tenant and Senior Living Communities is our largest entrance-fee community tenant. Our shift toward private payor facilities, as well as our expansion into the discretionary senior housing market, has further resulted in a portfolio whose current composition is relatively balanced between medical facilities, need-driven and discretionary senior housing.\nWe manage our business with a goal of increasing the regular annual dividends paid to shareholders. Our Board of Directors approves a regular quarterly dividend which is reflective of expected taxable income on a recurring basis. Our transactions that are infrequent and non-recurring that generate additional taxable income have been distributed to shareholders in the form of special dividends. Taxable income is determined in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and differs from net income for\nfinancial statements purposes determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our goal of increasing annual dividends requires a careful balance between identification of high-quality lease and mortgage assets in which to invest and the cost of our capital with which to fund such investments. We consider the competing interests of short and long-term debt (interest rates, maturities and other terms) versus the higher cost of new equity. We accept some level of risk associated with leveraging our investments. We intend to continue to make new investments that meet our underwriting criteria and where the spreads over our cost of capital will generate sufficient returns to our shareholders.\nOur dividends per share for the last three years are as follows:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>$\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur investments in healthcare real estate have been partially accomplished by our ability to effectively leverage our balance sheet. However, we continue to maintain a relatively low-leverage balance sheet compared with many in our peer group. We believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio, which is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including amounts in discontinued operations, excluding real estate asset impairments and gains on dispositions) to fixed charges (interest expense at contractual rates net of capitalized interest and principal payments on debt), and the ratio of consolidated net debt to Adjusted EBITDA are meaningful measures of our ability to service our debt. We use these two measures as a useful basis to compare the strength of our balance sheet with those in our peer group. We also believe this gives us a competitive advantage when accessing debt markets.\nWe calculate our fixed charge coverage ratio as approximately 6.0x for the year ended December 31, 2018 (see our discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to our net income on page 52). Giving effect to our acquisitions and financings on an annualized basis, our consolidated net debt-to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is approximately 4.5x for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Total Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,281,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(4,659\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Net Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,277,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized impact of recent investments\n</td> <td>2,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>282,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>x\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccording to the Administration on Aging ( AoA\u201d) of the US Department of Health and Human Services, in 2016, the latest year for which data is available, 49.2 million people were age 65 or older in the United States (a 33% increase over the last ten years). Census estimates showed that, by 2040, those 65 or older are expected to constitute 21.7% of the population. The population aged 85 and above is projected to rise from 6.4 million in 2016 to 14.6 million in the US by 2040 (a 129% increase).\nPer the AoA, in 2015, the median value of homes owned by older homeowners age 75 and over was $150,000 (with a median purchase price of $53,000). In comparison, the median home value of all homeowners was $180,000. Of the 11.9 million households headed by persons age 75 and over in 2015, 76% were owners. About 78% of these older homeowners in 2015 owned their homes free and clear. Home ownership provides the elderly with greater freedom to choose their lifestyles.\nEquipped with the basics of financial security, many will be economically able to enter the market for senior housing. These strong demographic trends provide the context for continued growth in senior housing in 2019 and the years ahead. We plan to fund any new real estate and mortgage investments during 2019 using our liquid assets and debt financing. As the weight of additional debt resulting from new acquisitions suggests the need to rebalance our capital structure, we would then expect to access the capital markets through an at-the-market ( ATM\u201d) or other equity offering. Our disciplined investment strategy implemented through measured increments of debt and equity sets the stage for access to capital at the lowest possible rates, annual dividend growth, continued low leverage, a portfolio of diversified, high-quality assets, and business relationships with experienced operators whom we make our priority, continue to be the key drivers of our business plan.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nEstimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. If actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.\nWe consider an accounting estimate or assumption critical if:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.\n</td> <td>the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.\n</td> <td>the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nValuations and Impairments\nOur tenants and borrowers who operate SNFs derive their revenues primarily from Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs. Amounts paid under these government programs are subject to legislative and government budget constraints. From time to time, there may be material changes in government reimbursement. In the past, SNFs have experienced material reductions in government reimbursement.\nThe long-term health care industry has experienced significant professional liability claims which have resulted in an increase in the cost of insurance to cover potential claims. In previous years, these factors have combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings, bankruptcy court rulings and court judgments affecting our lessees and borrowers. In prior years, we have determined that impairment of certain of our loan investments had occurred as a result of these events.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values of our properties on a property-by-property basis. On a quarterly basis, we review our properties for recoverability when events or circumstances, including significant physical changes in the property, significant adverse changes in general economic conditions and significant deteriorations of the underlying cash flows of the property, indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable. The need to recognize an impairment charge is based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of that property. If recognition of an impairment charge is necessary, it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the fair value of the property.\nFor our mortgage and other notes receivable, we evaluate the estimated collectibility of contractual loan payments and general economic conditions on an instrument-by-instrument basis. On a quarterly basis, we review our notes receivable for ability to realize on such notes when events or circumstances, including the non-receipt of contractual principal and interest payments, significant deteriorations of the financial condition of the borrower and significant adverse changes in general economic conditions, indicate that the carrying amount of the note receivable may not be recoverable. If necessary, impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value as measured by the discounted cash flows expected to be received under the note receivable or, if foreclosure is probable, the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable.\nThe determination of fair value and whether a shortfall in operating revenues or the existence of operating losses is indicative of a loss in value that is other than temporary involves significant judgment. Our estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and trends, the duration of the fair value deficiency, and any other relevant factors. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.\nWhile we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties are recoverable and our notes receivable and other investments are realizable, it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe collect rent and interest from our tenants and borrowers. Generally, our policy is to recognize income on an accrual basis as earned. However, when we determine, based on current collections and the lack of expected future collections, that rent or\ninterest is not probable of collection until received, our policy is to recognize rental or interest income when assured, which we consider to be the period in which cash is received or accrued on the basis of tenant security deposits available to us for the recognition of lease revenue in the period in which it was earned. We identify investments as nonperforming if a required payment is not received within 30 days of the date it is due. This policy could cause our revenues to vary significantly from period to period. Rental income from minimum lease payments under our leases is recognized on a straight-line basis to the extent that future lease payments are considered collectible. Lease payments that depend on a factor directly related to future use of the property, such as an increase in annual revenues over base year revenues, are considered to be contingent rentals and are included in rental income when they are determinable and earned.\nREIT Qualification\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with REIT requirements. Our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. We believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will be able to so qualify at all times. Until September 30, 2016, we operated a taxable REIT subsidiary under a joint venture structured to comply with the provisions of the RIDEA through which we invested in facility operations managed by independent third-parties. On September 30, 2016, NHI and Bickford entered into a definitive agreement terminating the joint venture. In the past we recorded income tax expense or benefit with respect to the subsidiary which was taxed under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations. Aside from such income taxes that may have been applicable to the taxable income in our taxable REIT subsidiary, we are not subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that we continue to qualify as a REIT and make distributions to stockholders equal to or in excess of our taxable income. This treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation\u201d (at the corporate and stockholder levels) that typically applies to corporate dividends. Our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable REIT qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the accounts of joint ventures in which we own a majority voting interest with the ability to control operations and where no substantive participating rights or substantive kick-out rights have been granted to the noncontrolling interests. In addition, we consolidate a legal entity deemed to be a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) when we determine that we are the VIE's primary beneficiary. All material inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) guidance for our arrangements with VIEs which requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. We may change our assessment of a VIE due to events such as modifications of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity's equity investments at risk and the disposal of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary.\nReal Estate Properties\nReal property we develop is recorded at cost, including the capitalization of interest during construction. The cost of real property investments we acquire is allocated to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their relative fair values. We make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. For properties acquired in transactions accounted for as asset purchases, the purchase price allocation is based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired. Cost includes the amount of contingent consideration, if any, deemed to be probable at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration is deemed to be probable to the extent that a significant reversal in amounts recognized is not likely to occur when the uncertainty associated with the contingent consideration is subsequently resolved. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to land, equipment, buildings and other improvements, and intangible assets, if any. Our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term.\nOur leases are typically structured as triple net leases\u201d on single-tenant properties having an initial leasehold term of 10 to 15 years with one or more 5-year renewal options. As such, there may be reporting periods in which we experience few, if any, lease renewals or expirations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not have any renewing or expiring leases.\nMost of our existing leases contain annual escalators in rent payments. For financial statement purposes, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain of our operators hold purchase options allowing them to acquire properties they currently lease from NHI. For options open or coming open in the short term, we are engaged in negotiations to continue as lessor or in some other capacity.\nWe adjust rental income for the amortization of payments recorded as the result of the eventual settlement of commitments and contingencies listed later in Item 7 as lease inducements. Amortization of these payments against revenues was $387,000, $119,000 and $40,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nMajor Tenants\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we have four lessees (including their affiliated entities, which are the legal tenants) from whom we individually derive at least 10% of our rental income as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Original\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rental Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lease\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Asset Class\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Renewal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior Living Communities\n</td> <td>EFC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>551,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2029\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bickford Senior Living\n</td> <td>ALF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Various\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Holiday Retirement\n</td> <td>ILF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>493,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2035\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>National HealthCare Corporation\n</td> <td>SNF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2026\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All others\n</td> <td>Various\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,067,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Various\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,815,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>265,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStraight-line rent of $5,436,000 and $6,984,000 was recognized from the Senior Living lease for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Straight-line rent of $5,028,000 and $5,102,000 was recognized from the Bickford leases for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Straight-line rent of $5,616,000 and $7,397,000 was recognized from the Holiday lease for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In November 2018, we announced an agreement with Holiday to receive approximately $65,762,000 in specified cash and other consideration in exchange for a reduced annual rental payment for the existing 25 properties, beginning at $31,500,000 for 2019, as discussed below under the heading Other Portfolio Activity. For NHC, rent escalations are based on a percentage increase in revenue over a base year and do not give rise to non-cash, straight-line rental income.\nOur operators report to us the results of their operations on a periodic basis, which we in turn subject to further analysis as a means of monitoring potential concerns within our portfolio. We have identified EBITDARM (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees) as the most elemental barometer of success for our tenants, based on results they have reported to us. We believe EBITDARM is useful in our most fundamental analyses, as it is a property level measure of our operators' success, by eliminating the effects of the operator's method of acquiring the use of its assets (interest and rent), its non-cash expenses (depreciation and amortization), expenses that are dependent on its level of success (income taxes), and also excluding the effect of the operator's payment of its management fees, as typically those fees are contractually subordinate to our lease payment. For operators of our entrance-fee communities, our calculation of EBITDARM includes other cash flow adjustments typical of the industry which may include, but are not limited to, net cash flows from entrance fees; amortization of deferred entrance fees; adjustments for tenant rent obligations, depreciation and amortization; and management fee true-ups. The eliminations and adjustments reflect covenants in our leases and provide a comparable basis for assessing our various relationships\nWe believe that EBITDARM is a useful way to analyze the cash potential of a group of assets. From EBITDARM we calculate a lease coverage ratio (EBITDARM/Cash Rent), measuring the ability of the operator to meet its monthly rental obligation. In addition to EBITDARM and the lease coverage ratio, we rely on, a careful balance sheet analysis, and other analytical procedures to help us identify potential areas of concern relative to our operators' ability to generate sufficient liquidity to meet their obligations, including their obligation to continue to pay the rent due to us. Typical among our operators is a varying lag in reporting to us the results of their operations. Across our portfolio, however, our operators report their results, at the latest, within ninety days of month's end. For computational purposes, we exclude development and lease-up properties that have been in operation less than\n24 months and selected immaterial properties identified in 2019 as available for sale.For stabilized acquisitions in the portfolio less than 24 months and renewing leases with changes in scheduled rent, we include pro forma cash rent. For this reporting period, we have excluded results from SH Regency Leasing, LLC, as noted below under the heading Other Portfolio Activity.\nThe results by asset type are presented below on a

independent living facilities\nFluctuations in portfolio coverage are a result of market and economic trends, local market competition, and regulatory factors as well as the operational success of our tenants. We use the results of individual leases to inform our decision making with respect to specific tenants, but trends described above by property type and operator bear analysis. Our Need-Driven SHO portfolio shows a decline brought about primarily by a softening in occupancy within particular markets, as well as rising wage pressures. For many of the affected operators, as is typical of our portfolio in general, NHI has significant security deposits in place and/or corporate guarantees should actual cash rental shortfalls eventually materialize. In certain instances, our operators may elect to increase their security deposits with us in an amount equal to the coverage shortfall, and, upon subsequent compliance with the required lease coverage ratio, the operator would then be entitled to a full refund. The metrics presented in the tables above give no effect to the presence of these security deposits. For Skilled Nursing, coverage in the All Other segment of our portfolio has improved due to a better operating environment for the segment, as a whole, and for the Ensign portfolio transition, in particular. Each MOB's coverage is driven by the underlying performance of its on-campus hospital as the tenant or guarantor under the lease. In Texas, the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 witnessed the shut-down of the guarantor hospital for a few days resulting in lost revenue, overtime and other one-time charges, negatively impacting the hospital's bottom-line and\nresultant coverage ratios for that MOB. Within the context of this event-specific occurrence, it is also typical of MOB operations that there may be other large fluctuations in coverage resulting from hospital operations.\nRIDEA\nOn September 30, 2016, NHI and Sycamore Street, LLC ( Sycamore\u201d), an affiliate of Bickford, entered into a definitive agreement terminating our joint venture which consisted of the ownership and operation of 40 properties and converting Bickford's participation to a triple-net tenancy with assumption of existing leases and terms. Through September 30, 2016, NHI owned an 85% equity interest and Sycamore owned a 15% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary, PropCo which owned 40 assisted living/memory care facilities, three new facilities and two facilities in development. The facilities had been leased to OpCo, in which NHI previously held a non-controlling 85% ownership interest. The facilities are managed by Bickford. The joint venture was structured to comply with the provisions of RIDEA. For the combined transaction, we recognized a gain of $1,657,000 on the sale of OpCo; we recognized $462,000 of income tax expense in applying a full valuation allowance to our state net operating loss carry-forwards on our Taxable REIT Subsidiary; Bickford's non-controlling interest was de-recognized; and the difference between the fair value of NHI's cost allocated to the redemption and the carrying amount of the 15% non-controlling interest was recorded as an adjustment to equity through additional-paid-in capital.\nPotential Effects of Medicare Reimbursement\nOur SNF operators receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare (federal) and Medicaid (states). Changes in reimbursement rates and limits on the scope of services reimbursed to skilled nursing facilities could have a material impact on the operators' liquidity and financial condition. On August 1, 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) announced the CMS Skilled Nursing Prospective Payment System ( PPS\u201d) final rule whereby, effective October 1, 2019, its Patient-Driven Payment Model ( PDPM\u201d) will replace Resource Utilization Groups ( RUGs\u201d)-IV. Facilities will have one year to transition to PDPM from RUGs-IV by the October 1, 2019 implementation date. PDPM is designed as a more simplified payment model than RUGs-IV and is projected to reduce administrative costs and foster innovation to improve care to patients. Regulators forecast a $2 billion reduction in provider costs over 10 years as a result of simplified paperwork requirements for resident assessments. The new model shifts care delivery under Medicare away from fee-for-service, which in the past has based reimbursement on the amount of care provided, to focus on value-based care, which will base reimbursement on clinical complexity and the resident's conditions and care needs. The final rule also established a 2.4% market basket increase beginning October 1, 2018.\nWe currently estimate that our borrowers and lessees will find these Medicare increases to be adequate in the near term due to their credit quality, profitability and their debt or lease coverage ratios, although no assurances can be given as to what the ultimate effect that PDPM increases on an annual basis will have on each of our borrowers and lessees. According to industry studies, state Medicaid funding is not expected to keep pace with inflation. Any future acquisitions by NHI of skilled nursing facilities are planned on a selective basis, with emphasis on operator quality and newer construction.\nInvestment Highlights\nSince January 1, 2018,

units and comprising five facilities, one of which is subject to a ground lease with remaining term, including extensions, of 50 years. The purchase price was $69,750,000, inclusive of $500,000 in closing costs and $1,750,000 in specified capital improvements, which will be added to the lease base upon funding. In addition to the cash consideration stated above, we recorded an intangible liability of $590,000 to recognize our above-market obligation for the ground lease. We included this portfolio in a separate master lease with Bickford which provides for a lease rate of 6.85%, with annual fixed escalators over a term of 15 years plus renewal options, subject to a fair market value rent reset feature available to NHI between years three and five.\nAt December 31, 2018, our ALF construction loans to Bickford are summarized as follows:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commencement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Commitment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Drawn\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Location\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>July 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,047,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Illinois\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,931,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Michigan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,000,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,515,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Virginia\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>July 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,700,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,978,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Michigan\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,700,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32,471,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe construction loans are secured by first mortgage liens on substantially all real and personal property as well as a pledge of any and all leases or agreements which may grant a right of use to the subject property. Usual and customary covenants extend to the agreements, including the borrower's obligation for payment of insurance and taxes. NHI has a purchase option on the properties at stabilization, whereby the lease rate will be set with a floor of 9.55%, based on NHI's total investment, plus fixed\nannual escalators. On these and future loan development projects, Bickford as the borrower is entitled to up to $2,000,000 per project in incentive loan draws based upon the achievement of predetermined operational milestones, the funding of which will increase the principal amount, NHI's future purchase price under option and, upon exercise, eventual lease payment to NHI.\nOur loans to Bickford represent a variable interest as do our leases which are considered analogous to financing arrangements. Bickford is structured to limit liability for potential claims for damages, is capitalized to achieve that purpose and is considered a VIE.\nEnsign\nOn January 12, 2018, NHI acquired from a developer a 121-bed skilled nursing facility in Waxahachie, Texas for a cash investment of $14,404,000, and in May, we acquired from another developer two 132-bed skilled nursing facilities in Garland and Fort Worth, Texas, for a cash investment totaling $29,000,000. Additional consideration of $1,275,000 for the Waxahachie property and $1,250,000 for each of Garland and Ft. Worth were contributed by the lessee, The Ensign Group ( Ensign\u201d). We have capitalized the tenant contributions as a component of the cost of the facilities and have recorded the contributions as deferred revenue, which we are amortizing to revenue over the term of the master lease to which these properties have now been added. The remaining term of the master lease extends through April 2031, plus renewal options. The blended initial lease rate is set at 8.1%, subject to annual escalators based on prevailing inflation rates. The acquisitions were accounted for as asset purchases and fulfill our original commitment to acquire and lease to Ensign four skilled nursing facilities in New Braunfels, Waxahachie, Garland and Fort Worth, Texas.\nComfort Care\nOn May 31, 2018, NHI acquired two assisted living facilities comprising a total of 106 units in Bridgeport and Saginaw, Michigan for a cash investment of $17,140,000, inclusive of $100,000 in closing costs. We leased the facilities to affiliates of Comfort Care Senior Living ( Comfort Care\u201d) at an initial lease rate of 7.25% with annual escalators adjusted for prevailing inflation rates, subject to a floor and ceiling of 2% and 3%, respectively. The lease provides for an initial six-month cash escrow. With the acquisition, NHI also obtained fair value-based purchase options for two newly constructed facilities operated by Comfort Care, with the purchase option windows to open upon stabilization. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase.\nIgnite\nIn December 2018, we reached an agreement with Ignite Team Partners, LLC, d/b/a Ignite Medical Resorts, to develop a $25,350,000 skilled nursing facility in suburban Milwaukee. The facility is currently under construction with an expected opening date in the fourth quarter of 2019. The facility will be leased to Ignite Healthcare, Inc. ( Ignite\u201d) for a term of 12 years, with two ten-year renewal options, at an initial lease rate of 9.5% plus annual fixed escalators. Ignite will be eligible for an earn-out of up to $2,000,000, to be funded beginning in 2026 upon the attainment of specified metrics. NHI will have a right of first offer on future Ignite projects. We accounted for the transaction as an asset purchase. At December 31, 2018, we had funded $4,674,000, including $2,000,000 for the purchase of land.\nLife Care Services\nOn December 21, 2018 we entered into an agreement to lend LCS-Westminster Partnership IV LLP ( Life Care Services IV\u201d), an affiliate of Life Care Services, the manager of the facility, up to $180,000,000. The loan agreement conveys a mortgage interest and will facilitate the construction of Phase II of Sagewood, a Type-A Continuing Care Retirement Community in Scottsdale, AZ.\nThe loan takes the form of two notes under a master credit agreement. The senior note ( Note A\u201d) totals $118,800,000 at a 7.25% interest rate with 10 basis-point escalators after year three and has a term of 10 years. We have funded $76,653,000 of Note A as of December 31, 2018. Note A is interest-only and is locked to prepayment until January 2021. After 2020, the prepayment penalty starts at 2% and declines to 1% in 2022. The second note ( Note B\u201d) is a construction loan for up to $61,200,000 at an annual interest rate of 8.50% and carries a five-year maturity. We anticipate funding Note B through April 2020 and anticipate substantial repayment with new resident entrance fees upon the opening of Phase II. The total amount funded on Note B was $10,165,000 as of December 31, 2018.\nWingate\nOn January 15, 2019, we acquired a 267-unit senior living campus in Massachusetts for a purchase price of $50,300,000, including closing costs of $300,000. The facility is being leased to Wingate Healthcare, Inc. ( Wingate\u201d) for a term of 10 years, with three five-year renewal options, at an initial lease rate of 7.5% plus annual fixed escalators. We have committed to the\nadditional funding of up to $1,900,000 in capital improvements, and the lease provides for incentives of $5,000,000 to become available beginning in 2020 upon the attainment of certain operating metrics. NHI will have a right of first offer on two additional Wingate-operated facilities. We accounted for the transaction as an asset purchase.\nOther Lease Portfolio Activity\nHoliday\nAs of December 31, 2018, we leased 25 independent living facilities to an affiliate of Holiday Retirement ( Holiday\u201d) at an original cost of $493,000,000. The 17-year master lease began in December 2013 and provides for a minimum annual escalator of 3.5% after 2017.\nOf our total revenues, $43,311,000 (15%), $43,817,000 (16%) and $43,817,000 (18%) were derived from Holiday for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, including $5,616,000, $7,397,000 and $8,965,000 in straight-line rent, respectively. Our tenant operates the facilities pursuant to a management agreement with a Holiday-affiliated manager.\nIn November 2018, we entered into a lease amendment and guaranty release ( the Agreement\u201d) with Holiday. The Agreement extends the term of the lease, increases required minimum capital expenditure per unit and provides NHI with stronger projected 2019 lease coverage ratio. Below is a summary of the provisions of the new agreement:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We are to receive consideration of approximately $65,762,000 consisting of a combination of cash and real estate equaling $55,125,000 and the forfeiture to us of $10,637,000 which is one-half of the original $21,275,000 security deposit.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The agreement provided that, in lieu of cash mentioned above, we could have sole discretion to acquire a Holiday property that will be leased back to Holiday at an agreed-upon rent and subject to the same terms and conditions of the amended master lease.

The use of the Credit Enhancement will be limited to payment of NHI rent and NHI-approved capital expenditures. Future return of the Credit Enhancement will further be limited by performance measures, including liquidity and lease service coverage ratio covenants. The Agreement also requires that $6,500,000 of equity be contributed to the Holiday management company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Effective January 1, 2019, Holiday rent was reset to $31,500,000 for the existing 25 properties, as opposed to the $39,000,000 previously obligated, with escalators commencing annually November 1, 2020, equal to the greater of 2.0% or 45% of trailing 12 months year-over-year revenue growth of the NHI/Holiday portfolio, not to exceed 3.0%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We have committed to invest up to $5,000,000 in capital expenditures into the communities at a 7.0% lease rate on funds drawn.

From 2019 through June 2022 we will include the deferred revenue balance of the straight-line payable for this lease among other liabilities on our balance sheet. After June 2022, cumulative straight-line amortization of the deferred revenue/expense associated with the Holiday lease will result in the more typical asset balance.\nTenant Non-Compliance\nAffiliates of East Lake\nIn documents we have previously filed with and furnished to the SEC, we have used the shorthand East Lake\u201d to refer to the East Lake Capital Management affiliated entities for whom we have acted or continue to act as landlord. These entities consist of\nEL FW Intermediary I, LLC (for the Freshwater/Watermark continuing care retirement communities) and SH Regency Leasing, LLC (for the three assisted living facilities in Tennessee, Indiana and North Carolina referred to as Regency\u201d).\nOn June 15, 2018, East Lake Capital Management LLC and certain related entities, including Regency, filed suit against NHI and NHI-REIT of Axel, LLC, in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas; 95th Judicial District for injunctive and declaratory relief and unspecified monetary damages, including attorney's fees. The suit sought, among other things, to enjoin NHI from making certain references to East Lake in NHI's public filings. In response to this lawsuit, related litigation, and other circumstances, we entered motions calling for the immediate appointment of a receiver and for pre-judgment possession, hearing, and bond.\nResulting from these claims and counterclaims, on December 6, 2018, the plaintiff parties entered into an agreement with NHI under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which rule ensures the enforceability of an agreement between lawyers in a case when the agreement is in writing and filed in the papers of the court. As provided by the agreement, Regency vacated our facilities in Indiana and North Carolina on December 7, 2018 and in Tennessee on December 14, 2018. Due to a decrease in occupancy and the deferral of needed maintenance and capital expenditures related to their operation, NHI made arrangements with operators to manage the three facilities. NHI will receive 95% of operating cash flow, if any, as generated by the facilities until such time as operations become stabilized or more formal agreements are entered into.\nThe original libel action of the East Lake affiliated entities survives the Rule 11 agreement and is set to continue in February 2019. NHI is not precluded from further action in damages under terms of the lease.\nAs of December 31, 2018, based on our assessment of likely undiscounted cash flows we determined no impairment charge was required on the land, building and improvements formerly leased to Regency. We wrote off straight-line receivables from the Regency properties totaling $1,820,000 during the fourth quarter of 2018 and included this amount in loan and realty losses in our consolidated statement of income.\nOf our total revenues, $5,103,000 (2%), $5,466,000 (2%), and $5,444,000 (2%) in lease revenues were derived from Regency for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOther\nIn the second quarter of 2018, we identified a single-property lease with a tenant in Wisconsin as non-performing. Lease revenues from the tenant have comprised less than 1% of our rental income, and the tenant is two months, or $840,000, in arrears on its rent payments to us as of December 31, 2018. In accordance with our revenue recognition policies, we will recognize future rental income from the lease in the period in which cash is received. Additionally, we may transition the lease to a new tenant. As a consequence of this course of action, the related straight-line receivable is considered uncollectible. Accordingly, in June 2018, we wrote off the balance of $1,436,000 pertaining to this tenant, included this amount in loan and realty losses in our consolidated statement of income and we ceased recording straight-line rent income. Personal guarantees totaling $3,000,000 remain in place.\nAnother of our tenants, The LaSalle Group, with five buildings in Illinois and Texas, is in material non-compliance with provisions of our lease regarding mandated coverage ratios, working capital requirements and timeliness of rent payments. Lease revenues from the tenant have comprised less than 2% of our rental income, and the tenant is two months in arrears on its rent payments to us as of December 31, 2018. As of October 31, 2018, we wrote off the accumulated straight-line rent receivable of $1,496,000, we ceased recording straight-line rent income, and we adopted the cash basis for recognition of revenues from this tenant. We have made no rent concessions to the tenant as of December 31, 2018, and we are pursuing our remedies to the full extent of our agreements. The tenant has requested forbearance, though no assurance can be given as of the date of this filing that an effective forbearance agreement can be reached.\nBased on our assessment of current operations and the availability of suitable operating partners, we may seek new tenants or managers for the other properties mentioned above. If we enter into a management agreement rather than a lease as we seek to stabilize the operations of these facilities and if our resulting operating partner does not have adequate liquidity to accept the risks and rewards of ownership, NHI might be deemed the primary beneficiary of the operations and might be required to consolidate those statements of financial position and results of operations of the managers or operating partners into our consolidated financial statements.\nOf our total revenues, $5,540,000 (2%), $6,141,000 (2%), and $1,957,000 (1%) in lease revenues were derived from the above tenants for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nUtilization of Tenant Escrow Deposits\nWe have available to us a total of $3,485,000 in escrowed deposits for the above-mentioned non-compliant tenants. Through the end of 2018, we made no draws against these deposits. When tenants have been changed to cash basis and prior to adjudication of any amounts in controversy, we assess the probability of recovery, if any, through legal recourse against amounts on escrow. We consider available escrowed funds to the extent, under governing lease provisions, that specified costs incurred are to be borne by the tenant. Accordingly, we have recognized $2,534,000 as a receivable against these escrowed deposits to satisfy property tax liabilities and as reimbursement for expenses explicitly delineated under the leases.\nVIE Considerations\nWith Regency's relinquishment of possession of the three NHI facilities as discussed above, our prospective entry into management agreements with operators willing to venture into speculative operations entails structuring the agreements so that NHI, who stands to gain the most from rehabilitation of the properties, will likely expect to absorb most of the losses, if any, that these operators will encounter during revitalization of operations at the three properties. As a result of finalizing these agreements, entity-level operations at each facility may be considered variable interests, the operators may be considered variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d), and NHI may potentially be considered the primary beneficiary of those entities. Consequently, NHI may be required to consolidate these operations in 2019. If so, we expect that our statements of income will reflect revenues and expenses from these foreclosed operations. During 2018, activities at these facilities were immaterial to the results of NHI's operations.\nIt is possible that consolidation will also result from our interactions and negotiations with any of the operators of the other properties discussed above, however, the nature and form of any agreements that will result from this process are unknown at this time.\nFor operations which we place in our Taxable REIT Subsidiary ( TRS\u201d), we have NOL carryforwards of $462,000 available to offset taxable income in the TRS. The carry-forwards expire beginning in 2028.\nPrior Year\nIn October 2017, we issued a letter of forbearance to one of our tenants for a default on our lease terms involving coverage and liquidity ratios. Rent payments to NHI are current as of December 31, 2018. Lease revenues from the tenant and its affiliates comprise 3% of our rental income, and the related straight-line rent receivable was approximately $4,566,000 at December 31, 2018. NHI's ongoing monitoring from 2017 through 2018 indicated that the tenant's operations and financial position have continued to improve, and in February 2019 we released them from provisions of the forbearance letter.\nTenant Purchase Options\nCertain of our operators hold purchase options allowing them to acquire properties they currently lease from NHI. For options open or coming open in the near future, we are engaged in preliminary negotiations to continue as lessor or in some other capacity. A summary of these tenant options to purchase senior housing communities, hospitals, medical office buildings and skilled nursing facilities is presented below ($ in thousands):\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset\n</td> <td>Number of\n</td> <td>Lease\n</td> <td>1st Option\n</td> <td>Current\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Type\n</td> <td>Facilities\n</td> <td>Expiration\n</td> <td>Open Year\n</td> <td>Cash Rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MOB\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>February 2025\n</td> <td>Open\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HOSP\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>September 2027\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SHO\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>December 2024\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HOSP\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>March 2025\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SHO\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>May 2031\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HOSP\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>June 2022\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Various\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen present, tenant purchase options generally give the lessee an option to purchase the underlying property for consideration determined by i) a sliding base dependent upon the extent of appreciation in the property plus a specified proportion of any appreciation; ii) our acquisition costs plus a specified proportion of any appreciation; iii) an agreed capitalization rate applied to the current rental; or iv) our acquisition costs plus a profit floor plus a specified proportion of any appreciation.\nReal Estate and Mortgage Write-downs\nOur borrowers and tenants experience periods of significant financial pressures and difficulties similar to those encountered by other health care providers. Governments at both the federal and state levels have enacted legislation to lower, or at least slow, the growth in payments to health care providers. Furthermore, the cost of professional liability insurance has increased significantly during this same period. Since our inception in 1991, a number of our facility operators and mortgage loan borrowers have undergone bankruptcy. Others have been forced to surrender properties to us in lieu of foreclosure or, for certain periods, have failed to make timely payments on their obligations to us.\nWe believe that the current carrying amounts of our real estate properties are recoverable and that mortgage notes receivable are realizable and supported by the value of the underlying collateral. However, it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments to these carrying amounts.\nResults of Operations\nThe significant items affecting revenues and expenses are

Net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased primarily due to $225,646,000 of investments in real estate and notes, which were partially offset by collection of notes receivable, sales of marketable securities and certain real estate assets, compared with $486,788,000 of investments in real estate and notes in 2016 that were similarly offset by collections.\nFinancing Activities - The use of cash in financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 resulted primarily from the excess of dividend payments over proceeds from equity offerings, the impact of other large transactions primarily being the restructuring of our debt.\nLiquidity\nApart from operations, a primary source of our liquidity is our unsecured bank credit facility. At December 31, 2018, we had $466,000,000 available to draw on our revolving credit facility.\nOur bank credit facility derives from agreements entered into in August 2017 and September 2018. Together these agreements establish our unsecured $1,100,000,000 bank credit facility, which consists of $250,000,000 and $300,000,000 term loans and a $550,000,000 revolving credit facility. The $250,000,000 term loan and $550,000,000 revolving facility mature in August 2022, and the $300,000,000 term loan matures in September 2023. With the 2018 Agreement, we converted $300,000,000 of debt initially drawn on our revolving facility into a five-year term loan.\nThe revolving facility fee is currently 20 basis points per annum, and floating interest on the revolver and term loans are presently set at 30-day LIBOR (252 bps at December 31, 2018) plus 115 and a blended 127 basis points, respectively. Within the facility, the employment of interest rate swaps for our fixed term debt leaves only our revolving credit facility and newly issued term loan of $300,000,000 exposed to interest rate risk through April 2019, when our $40,000,000 swap expires. Our swaps and the financial instruments to which they relate are described later in this section. The current interest spreads and facility fee reflect our leverage-ratio compliance based on the applicable margin for LIBOR loans, measuring debt to Total Asset Value,\u201d at Level 2 in the Interest Rate Schedule provided below in abridged format:\nInterest Rate Schedule\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level\n</td> <td>Leverage Ratio\n</td> <td>Revolver\n</td> <td>$300m Term Loan\n</td> <td>$250m Term Loan\n</td> <td>Facility Fee\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>< 0.35\n</td> <td>1.10%\n</td> <td>1.20%\n</td> <td>1.25%\n</td> <td>0.15%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>\u2265 0.35 & < 0.40\n</td> <td>1.15%\n</td> <td>1.25%\n</td> <td>1.30%\n</td> <td>0.20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3\n</td> <td>\u2265 0.40 & < 0.45\n</td> <td>1.20%\n</td> <td>1.30%\n</td> <td>1.35%\n</td> <td>0.20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4\n</td> <td>\u2265 0.45 & < 0.50\n</td> <td>1.25%\n</td> <td>1.40%\n</td> <td>1.45%\n</td> <td>0.25%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBeyond the applicable ratios detailed above, increasing levels of leverage (not shown) will subject our debt to defined increases in interest rates and fees.\nThe credit facility agreement requires that we calculate specified financial statement metrics and meet or exceed a variety of financial ratios, which are usual and customary in nature. These ratios are calculated quarterly and have been within required limits. The calculation of our leverage ratio involves intermediate determinations of our total indebtedness\u201d and of our total asset value,\u201d as defined. We are near the upper bounds delineated by Level 2 in the Interest Rate Schedule, above.\nAside from a more favorable rate, the 2018 Agreement generally calls for the same covenants and financial statement metrics required for compliance with terms of the 2017 Agreement. Although we are currently eligible under both agreements to transact in our unsecured bank credit facilities at the respective scheduled rates represented by Level 2, the movement of our leverage ratio into Level 3 at current levels of debt would result in additional annual costs of approximately $375,000, assuming an average revolver balance of approximately $200,000,000. Further movement of our leverage ratio beyond levels currently contemplated by management would be subject to escalating increases in interest. If, in addition to changes in the leverage ratio, certain qualitative indicators of our risk profile were to materially change, further interest-rate escalations may result.\nTraditionally, debt financing and cash resulting from operating and investing activities, which are derived from proceeds of lease and note collections, loan payoffs and the recovery of previous write-downs, have been used to satisfy our operational and investing needs and to provide a return to our shareholders. Those operational and investing needs reflect the resources necessary to maintain and cultivate our funding sources and have generally fallen into three categories: debt service, REIT operating expenses, and new real estate and note investments.\nNHI's at-the-market ( ATM\u201d) offerings were initially made pursuant to a prospectus dated March 18, 2014, and a related prospectus supplement dated February 17, 2015, which constitute a part of our effective shelf registration statement that was previously filed with the SEC. We filed a new registration statement and commenced a new ATM program effective February 22, 2017. The following table summarizes the issuances since inception on our ATM as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Shares\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Share Price\n</td> <td>Net Proceeds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>830,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,389,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>1,395,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,190,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>1,661,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>1,112,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,001,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>4,999,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>358,080,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table above does not include indirect legal and accounting costs of $263,000 for 2017 and $217,000 for 2018 associated with updating and maintaining our shelf registration statement.\nWe began liquidating our position in LTC Properties, Inc. ( LTC\u201d) common stock in the fourth quarter of 2015. We realized taxable gains of $10,038,000 and $29,673,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe use of funds from our ATM and the liquidation of our position in LTC common stock effected a rebalancing of our leverage in response to our acquisitions and has kept our options flexible for further expansion. We continue to explore various other funding sources including bank term loans, convertible debt, traditional equity placement, unsecured bonds and senior notes, debt private placement and secured government agency financing. We view our ATM program as an effective way to match-fund our smaller acquisitions by exercising control over the timing and size of transactions and achieving a more favorable cost of capital as compared to larger follow-on offerings.\nWe expect that borrowings on our revolving credit facility, borrowings on term loans, and our ATM program will allow us to continue to make real estate investments during 2019. However, we anticipate that our historically low cost of debt capital will continue to rise in the near to mid-term, as the federal government prolongs the upward transitioning of the federal funds rate. In response to the changed interest-rate environment, we may find it advisable within the coming year to acquire a public credit rating as a tool for managing our interest costs.\nWe anticipate continued use of proceeds from the ATM program for general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions and repayment of indebtedness, including borrowings under our credit facility. Acquisitions, if any, whose magnitude would entail an equity match unable to be efficiently sourced through the ATM would likely trigger a prospectus supplement and an underwritten or overnight offering of NHI common stock, rather than placement through the ATM.\nConcurrent with the amendments to our credit facility and with the exception of specific debt-coverage ratios, covenants pertaining to our private placement term loans were generally conformed with those governing the credit facility.\nIn other financing transactions during the year ended December 31, 2018, we undertook targeted open-market repurchases of certain of our convertible notes. Settlement of the notes requires management to allocate the consideration we ultimately pay between the debt component and the equity conversion feature as though they were separate instruments. The allocation is effected by fair valuing the debt component first, with any remainder allocated to the conversion feature. Amounts expended to settle the notes are recognized first as a settlement of the notes at our carrying value and then are recognized in income to the extent the portion allocated to the debt instrument differs from carrying value. The remainder of the allocation, if any, is treated as settlement of equity and adjusted through our capital in excess of par account.\nA roll-forward of our convertible note balances, including the effect of year-to-date amortization, net of issuance costs, is presented below:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>Amounts Retired\n</td> <td>Amortization\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Face Amount\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,575\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount\n</td> <td>(2,637\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,391\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuance Costs\n</td> <td>(1,752\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(910\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Carrying Value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal expenditures of $29,985,000 include paid amounts of $27,558,000 allocated to the note retirement with the remaining expenditure of $2,427,000 allocated to capital in excess of par. A loss of $738,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, resulted from the excess of cash expenditures over the book value of the notes retired, net of discount and issuance costs.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our senior unsecured convertible notes were convertible at a rate of 14.42 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount, representing a conversion price of approximately $69.36 per share for a total of 1,730,174 remaining underlying shares. For the year ended December 31, 2018, dilution resulting from the conversion option within our convertible debt is 80,123 shares. If NHI's current share price increases above the adjusted $69.36 conversion price, further dilution will be attributable to the conversion feature. On December 31, 2018, the value of the convertible debt, computed as if the debt were immediately eligible for conversion, exceeded its face amount by $10,697,000.\nWe may continue from time to time to seek to retire or purchase some of our outstanding convertible notes through cash open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. As with our 2018 repurchases, amounts and timing of further repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be dependent on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nWhen we take on new debt or when we modify or replace existing debt, we incur debt issuance costs. These costs are subject to amortization over the term of the new debt instrument and may result in the write-off of fees associated with debt which has been replaced or modified. Sustaining long-term dividend growth will require that we consider all sources of capital mentioned above, with the goal of maintaining a low-leverage balance sheet as mitigation against potential adverse changes in the business of our industry, tenants and borrowers.\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nTo mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk, we have in place the following interest rate swap contracts in place to hedge against floating rates on our $250,000,000 bank term loan as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Date Entered\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fixed Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate Index\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Notional Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.84%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-month LIBOR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.41%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-month LIBOR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.46%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-month LIBOR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative has been reported as a component of other comprehensive income ( OCI\u201d), and reclassified into earnings in the same period, or periods, during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness have been recognized in earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness related to our cash flow hedges, which is reported in current period earnings as interest expense, was not significant in 2016. With the amendment of our bank credit facility in August 2017, discussed above, the introduction to the debt instrument of a LIBOR floor not present in the hedges resulted in hedge inefficiency of approximately $353,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, which we credited to interest expense.\nOn January 1, 2018 we adopted ASU 2017-12 Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, as discussed in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. The transition method is a modified retrospective approach that required the Company to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of 2018. The primary provision in the ASU requiring adjustment to our beginning retained earnings is the change in timing and income statement line item for ineffectiveness related to cash flow hedges. Upon the adoption of the new standard, we reversed cumulative ineffectiveness occurring in the last six months of 2017, resulting in a retroactive net charge to retained earnings and a credit to accumulated other comprehensive income of $235,000 as of January 1, 2018. Upon adoption of the ASU, the Company achieved a better alignment of its financial reporting for hedging activities with the economic objectives of those activities.\nWe intend to comply with REIT dividend requirements that we distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2018 and thereafter. Dividends declared for the fourth quarter of each fiscal year are paid by the end of the following January and are, with some exceptions, treated for tax purposes as having been paid in the fiscal year just ended as provided in IRS Code Sec. 857(b)(8). We declare special dividends when we compute our REIT taxable income in an amount that exceeds our regular dividends for the fiscal year.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently have no outstanding guarantees. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, our leases, mortgages and other notes receivable with certain entities represent variable interests in those enterprises. However, because we do not control these entities, nor do we have any role in their day-to-day management, we are not their primary beneficiary. Except as discussed below under Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities, we have no further material obligations arising from our transactions with these entities, and we believe our maximum exposure to loss at December 31, 2018, due to this involvement would be limited to our contractual commitments and contingent liabilities and the amount of our current investments with them, as detailed further in in Notes 1, 2, 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2014 we issued $200,000,000 of convertible notes, the conversion feature being intended to broaden the Company's credit profile and as a means to obtain a more favorable coupon rate. For this feature we calculate the dilutive effect using market prices prevailing over the reporting period. Because the dilution calculation is market-driven, and per share guidance we provide is based on diluted amounts, the theoretical effects of the conversion feature result in per share unpredictability.\nAdditional disclosure requirements also give widely ranging results depending on market price variability. The notes will be freely convertible in the last six months of their contractual life, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020; however, generally accepted accounting principles require us to periodically report the amount by which the notes' convertible value exceeds their principal amount, without regard to the current availability of the conversion feature. Further, the mechanics of the calculation require the use of an end-of-period stock price, so that using that amount for the remaining notes outstanding of $120,000,000 at December 31, 2018, delivers an excess of $10,697,000, whereas the use of another price point would give a different result.\nThe conversion feature is generally available to the noteholders entering the last six months of the notes' term but may also become actionable if the market price of NHI's common stock should, for 20 of 30 consecutive trading days within a calendar quarter, sustain a level in excess of 130% of the adjusted conversion price, or $90.44 per share, down from $93.55 per share, initially. The notes are optional net-share settlement\u201d instruments, meaning that NHI has the ability and intent to settle the principal amount of the indebtedness in cash, with possible dilutive share issuances for any excess, at NHI's option. Settlement of the notes requires management to allocate the consideration we ultimately pay between the debt component and the equity conversion\nfeature as though they were separate instruments. The allocation is effected by valuing the debt component first, with any remainder allocated to the conversion feature. Amounts expended to settle the notes will be recognized first as a settlement of the notes at par and then will be recognized in income to the extent the portion allocated to the debt instrument differs from par value. The remainder of the allocation, if any, will be treated as settlement of equity and adjusted through our paid in capital account.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2018, our contractual payment obligations were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt, including interest1\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,557,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>596,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>746,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction commitments\n</td> <td>24,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan commitments\n</td> <td>132,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,714,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>596,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>746,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Interest is calculated based on the weighted average interest rate of outstanding debt balances as of December 31, 2018.

Upon funding, these payments are added to the lease base and amortized against rental income.\nFor a discussion of incentive loan draws of $8,000,000 available to Bickford related to borrowings for the development of its properties in Illinois, Michigan, and Virginia, see page 34 of Investment Highlights.\nLitigation\nOn June 15, 2018, East Lake Capital Management LLC and certain related entities, including Regency, filed suit against NHI and NHI-REIT of Axel, LLC, in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas; 95th Judicial District for injunctive and declaratory relief and unspecified monetary damages, including attorney's fees. The suit sought, among other things, to enjoin NHI from making certain references to East Lake in NHI's public filings. In response to this lawsuit, related litigation, and other circumstances, we entered motions calling for the immediate appointment of a receiver and for pre-judgment possession, hearing, and bond.\nResulting from these claims and counterclaims, on December 6, 2018, the plaintiff parties entered into an agreement with NHI under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which rule ensures the enforceability of an agreement between lawyers in a case when the agreement is in writing and filed in the papers of the court. The agreement provided that Regency vacate our facilities in Indiana and North Carolina on December 7, 2018 and in Tennessee on December 14, 2018. Further, Regency agreed to provide minimal levels of cooperation in transitioning the facilities.\nThe original libel action of the East Lake affiliated entities survives the Rule 11 agreement and is set to continue in January 2019. NHI is not precluded from further action in damages under terms of the lease.\nWith Regency's relinquishment of possession of the three NHI facilities as discussed above, our prospective entry into management agreements with operators willing to venture into speculative operations entails structuring the agreements so that NHI, who stands to gain the most from rehabilitation of the properties, will likely expect to absorb most of the losses, if any, that these operators will encounter during revitalization of operations at the three properties. As a result of finalizing these agreements, entity-level operations at each facility may be considered variable interests, the operators may be considered variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d), and NHI may potentially be considered the primary beneficiary of those entities. Consequently, NHI may be required to consolidate these operations in 2019. If so, we expect that our statements of income will reflect revenues and expenses from these foreclosed operations. During 2018, activities at these facilities were immaterial to the results of NHI's operations.\nFFO, AFFO & FAD\nThese supplemental operating performance measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other REITs. Consequently, our Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d), Normalized FFO, Normalized Adjusted Funds From Operations ( AFFO\u201d) and Normalized Funds Available for Distribution ( FAD\u201d) may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other REITs. Since other REITs may not use our definition of these operating performance measures, caution should be exercised when comparing our Company's FFO, Normalized FFO, Normalized AFFO and Normalized FAD to that of other REITs. These financial performance measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) (these measures do not include changes in operating assets and liabilities) and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance, or to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity, and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.\nFunds From Operations - FFO\nOur FFO per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $(0.14) (2.5%) over the same period in 2017. Our normalized FFO for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $0.17 (3.2%) over the same period in 2017, primarily as the result of our new real estate investments in 2017 and 2018. FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) and applied by us, is net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment, if applicable, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, if any. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from that of the Company; therefore, caution should be exercised when comparing our Company's FFO to that of other REITs. Diluted FFO assumes the exercise of stock options and other potentially dilutive securities. Normalized FFO excludes from FFO certain items which may create some difficulty in comparing FFO for the current period to similar prior periods, and may include, but are not limited to, impairment of non-real estate assets, gains and losses attributable to the acquisition and disposition of assets and liabilities, recoveries of previous write-downs and the write off of debt issuance costs due to credit facility modifications.\nFFO and normalized FFO are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative, and should be supplemented with a measure such as FFO. The term FFO was designed by the REIT industry to address this issue.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations - AFFO\nOur normalized AFFO per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $0.29 (6.1%) over the same period in 2017 due primarily to the impact of real estate investments completed during 2017 and 2018. In addition to the adjustments included in the calculation of normalized FFO, normalized AFFO excludes the impact of any straight-line rent revenue, amortization of the original issue discount on our convertible senior notes and amortization of debt issuance costs.\nNormalized AFFO is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT. GAAP requires a lessor to recognize contractual lease payments into income on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease. This straight-line adjustment has the effect of reporting lease income that is significantly more or less than the contractual cash flows received pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement. GAAP also requires the original issue discount of our convertible senior notes and debt issuance costs to be amortized as non-cash adjustments to earnings. Normalized AFFO is useful to our investors as it reflects the growth inherent in the contractual lease payments of our real estate portfolio.\nFunds Available for Distribution - FAD\nOur normalized FAD for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $16,395,000 (8.3%) over the same period in 2017 due primarily to the impact of real estate investments completed during 2017 and 2018. In addition to the adjustments included in the calculation of normalized AFFO, normalized FAD excludes the impact of non-cash stock based compensation. Normalized FAD is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT as a useful indicator of the ability to distribute dividends to shareholders. Additionally, normalized FAD improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with: (i) expected results, (ii) results of previous periods and (iii) results among REITs, more meaningful. Because FAD may function as a liquidity measure, we do not present FAD on a per-share basis.\nThe following table reconciles net income attributable to common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP metric, to FFO, Normalized FFO, Normalized AFFO and Normalized FAD and is presented for both basic and diluted weighted average common shares (in thousands, except share and per share

to evaluate our performance and serves as an indication of our ability to service debt. We define Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including amounts in discontinued operations, excluding real estate asset impairments and gains on dispositions and certain items which may create some difficulty in comparing Adjusted EBITDA for the current period to similar prior periods, and may include, but are not limited to, impairment of non-real estate assets, gains and losses attributable to the acquisition and disposition of assets and liabilities, and recoveries of previous write-downs.

unsecured convertible notes were convertible at a rate of 14.42 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount, representing a conversion price of approximately $69.36 per share for a total of 1,730,174 remaining underlying shares. For the year ended December 31, 2018, dilution resulting from the conversion option within our convertible debt is 80,123 shares. If NHI's current share price increases above the adjusted $69.36 conversion price, further dilution will be attributable to the conversion feature. On December 31, 2018, the value of the convertible debt, computed as if the debt were immediately eligible for conversion, exceeded its face amount by $10,697,000.\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt, including interest1\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,557,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>596,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>746,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction commitments\n</td> <td>24,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan commitments\n</td> <td>132,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,714,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>596,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>746,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\n\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Asset Class\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Ensign Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January / May 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SNF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bickford Senior Living\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comfort Care Senior Living\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ignite Medical Resorts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SNF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Note Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bickford Senior Living\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bickford Senior Living\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Life Care Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>364,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wingate Healthcare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Holiday Retirement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>SHO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for full details of our loan commitments.

we develop is recorded at cost, including the capitalization of interest during construction. The cost of real property investments we acquire is allocated to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their relative fair values. We make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. For properties acquired in transactions accounted for as asset purchases, the purchase price allocation is based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired. Cost includes the amount of contingent consideration, if any, deemed to be probable at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration is deemed to be probable to the extent that a significant reversal in amounts recognized is not likely to occur when the uncertainty associated with the contingent consideration is subsequently resolved. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to land, equipment, buildings and other improvements, and intangible assets, if any. Our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term.\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Estate Properties\n</td> <td>Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beds/Sq.

As a result of finalizing these agreements, entity-level operations at each facility may be considered variable interests, the operators may be considered variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d), and NHI may potentially be considered the primary beneficiary of those entities. Consequently, NHI may be required to consolidate these operations in 2019. If so, we expect that our statements of income will reflect revenues and expenses from these foreclosed operations.

covenants and financial statement metrics required for compliance with terms of the 2017 Agreement. Although we are currently eligible under both agreements to transact in our unsecured bank credit facilities at the respective scheduled rates represented by Level 2, the movement of our leverage ratio into Level 3 at current levels of debt would result in additional annual costs of approximately $375,000, assuming an average revolver balance of approximately $200,000,000. Further movement of our leverage ratio beyond levels currently contemplated by management would be subject to escalating increases in interest. If, in addition to changes in the leverage ratio, certain qualitative indicators of our risk profile were to materially change, further interest-rate escalations may result.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Date Entered\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maturity Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fixed Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate Index\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Notional Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>April 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.84%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-month LIBOR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.41%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-month LIBOR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.46%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-month LIBOR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>687\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable GAAP metric, to Adjusted EBITDA:\n\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portfolio Summary\n</td> <td>Properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beds/Sq.

As provided by the agreement, Regency vacated our facilities in Indiana and North Carolina on December 7, 2018 and in Tennessee on December 14, 2018. Due to a decrease in occupancy and the deferral of needed maintenance and capital expenditures related to their operation, NHI made arrangements with operators to manage the three facilities. NHI will receive 95% of operating cash flow, if any, as generated by the facilities until such time as operations become stabilized or more formal agreements are entered into.\nEL FW Intermediary I, LLC (for the Freshwater/Watermark continuing care retirement communities) and SH Regency Leasing, LLC (for the three assisted living facilities in Tennessee, Indiana and North Carolina referred to as Regency\u201d).\nPortfolio\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. If actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Total Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,281,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(4,659\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Net Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,277,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized impact of recent investments\n</td> <td>2,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>282,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>x\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that EBITDARM is a useful way to analyze the cash potential of a group of assets. From EBITDARM we calculate a lease coverage ratio (EBITDARM/Cash Rent), measuring the ability of the operator to meet its monthly rental obligation. In addition to EBITDARM and the lease coverage ratio, we rely on, a careful balance sheet analysis, and other analytical procedures to help us identify potential areas of concern relative to our operators' ability to generate sufficient liquidity to meet their obligations, including their obligation to continue to pay the rent due to us. Typical among our operators is a varying lag in reporting to us the results of their operations. Across our portfolio, however, our operators report their results, at the latest, within ninety days of month's end.

Because the dilution calculation is market-driven, and per share guidance we provide is based on diluted amounts, the theoretical effects of the conversion feature result in per share unpredictability.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

discussed above, our prospective entry into management agreements with operators willing to venture into speculative operations entails structuring the agreements so that NHI, who stands to gain the most from rehabilitation of the properties, will likely expect to absorb most of the losses, if any, that these operators will encounter during revitalization of operations at the three properties. As a result of finalizing these agreements, entity-level operations at each facility may be considered variable interests, the operators may be considered variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d), and NHI may potentially be considered the primary beneficiary of those entities. Consequently, NHI may be required to consolidate these operations in 2019. If so, we expect that our statements of income will reflect revenues and expenses from these foreclosed operations. During 2018, activities at these facilities were immaterial to the results of NHI's operations.\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LIBOR Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level\n</td> <td>Leverage Ratio\n</td> <td>Revolver\n</td> <td>$300m Term Loan\n</td> <td>$250m Term Loan\n</td> <td>Facility Fee\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>< 0.35\n</td> <td>1.10%\n</td> <td>1.20%\n</td> <td>1.25%\n</td> <td>0.15%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>\u2265 0.35 & < 0.40\n</td> <td>1.15%\n</td> <td>1.25%\n</td> <td>1.30%\n</td> <td>0.20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3\n</td> <td>\u2265 0.40 & < 0.45\n</td> <td>1.20%\n</td> <td>1.30%\n</td> <td>1.35%\n</td> <td>0.20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4\n</td> <td>\u2265 0.45 & < 0.50\n</td> <td>1.25%\n</td> <td>1.40%\n</td> <td>1.45%\n</td> <td>0.25%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConcurrent with the amendments to our credit facility and with the exception of specific debt-coverage ratios, covenants pertaining to our private placement term loans were generally conformed with those governing the credit facility.\nTenant Purchase Options\n\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Shares\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Share Price\n</td> <td>Net Proceeds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>830,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,389,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>1,395,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75.79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,190,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>1,661,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>1,112,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,001,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>4,999,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>358,080,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the second quarter of 2018, we identified a single-property lease with a tenant in Wisconsin as non-performing. Lease revenues from the tenant have comprised less than 1% of our rental income, and the tenant is two months, or $840,000, in arrears on its rent payments to us as of December 31, 2018. In accordance with our revenue recognition policies, we will recognize future rental income from the lease in the period in which cash is received. Additionally, we may transition the lease to a new tenant. As a consequence of this course of action, the related straight-line receivable is considered uncollectible. Accordingly, in June 2018, we wrote off the balance of $1,436,000 pertaining to this tenant, included this amount in loan and realty losses in our consolidated statement of income and we ceased recording straight-line rent income. Personal guarantees totaling $3,000,000 remain in place.\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the accounts of joint ventures in which we own a majority voting interest with the ability to control operations and where no substantive participating rights or substantive kick-out rights have been granted to the noncontrolling interests. In addition, we consolidate a legal entity deemed to be a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) when we determine that we are the VIE's primary beneficiary. All material inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n \u2022 In September 2016 we unwound our joint venture interest in a RIDEA that we accounted for under the equity method. Subsequent periods show no corresponding entry for the attribution of $1,176,000 to the minority interest. \nOur FFO per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $(0.14) (2.5%) over the same period in 2017. Our normalized FFO for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $0.17 (3.2%) over the same period in 2017, primarily as the result of our new real estate investments in 2017 and 2018. FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) and applied by us, is net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment, if applicable, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, if any. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from that of the Company; therefore, caution should be exercised when comparing our Company's FFO to that of other REITs. Diluted FFO assumes the exercise of stock options and other potentially dilutive securities. Normalized FFO excludes from FFO certain items which may create some difficulty in comparing FFO for the current period to similar prior periods, and may include, but are not limited to, impairment of non-real estate assets, gains and losses attributable to the acquisition and disposition of assets and liabilities, recoveries of previous write-downs and the write off of debt issuance costs due to credit facility modifications.\n \u2022 Depreciation expense increased $7,648,000 primarily due to new real estate investments completed during 2017 and 2016. \nAt December 31, 2018, our ALF construction loans to Bickford are summarized as follows:\n \u2022 Interest expense, including amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, increased $2,731,000 primarily as a result of an increase in 30-day LIBOR, which is the benchmark for our revolving debt. \nOur dividends per share for the last three years are as follows:\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nPotential Effects of Medicare Reimbursement\nWe adjust rental income for the amortization of payments recorded as the result of the eventual settlement of commitments and contingencies listed later in Item 7 as lease inducements. Amortization of these payments against revenues was $387,000, $119,000 and $40,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe conversion feature is generally available to the noteholders entering the last six months of the notes' term but may also become actionable if the market price of NHI's common stock should, for 20 of 30 consecutive trading days within a calendar quarter, sustain a level in excess of 130% of the adjusted conversion price, or $90.44 per share, down from $93.55 per share, initially. The notes are optional net-share settlement\u201d instruments, meaning that NHI has the ability and intent to settle the principal amount of the indebtedness in cash, with possible dilutive share issuances for any excess, at NHI's option. Settlement of the notes requires management to allocate the consideration we ultimately pay between the debt component and the equity conversion\nInvestment Highlights\nInvesting Activities - Net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased primarily due to $254,636,000 of investments in real estate and notes, which were partially offset by collection of notes receivable. Net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased primarily due to $225,646,000 of investments in real estate and notes, which were partially offset by collection of notes receivable, sales of marketable securities and certain real estate assets, compared with $486,788,000 of investments in real estate and notes in 2016 that were similarly offset by collections.\nLife Care Services\nReal Estate Properties\nTenant Non-Compliance\nWe are evaluating and will likely make real estate and note investments in 2019 while we continue to monitor and improve our existing properties. We seek tenants who will become mission-oriented partners in relationships where our business goals are aligned. This approach aims to fuel steady, and thus, enduring growth for those partners and for NHI. Within the context of our growth model, we rely on a cost-effective access to debt and equity capital to finance acquisitions that will drive our earnings. There is significant competition for healthcare assets from other REITs, both public and private, and from private equity sources. Large-scale portfolios continue to command premium pricing, due to the continued abundance of private and foreign buyers seeking to invest in healthcare real estate. This combination of circumstances places a premium on our ability to execute acquisitions and negotiate leases that will generate meaningful earnings growth for our shareholders. We emphasize growth with our existing tenants and borrowers as a way to insulate us from other competition.\n 2. the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. \nWe currently estimate that our borrowers and lessees will find these Medicare increases to be adequate in the near term due to their credit quality, profitability and their debt or lease coverage ratios, although no assurances can be given as to what the ultimate effect that PDPM increases on an annual basis will have on each of our borrowers and lessees. According to industry studies, state Medicaid funding is not expected to keep pace with inflation. Any future acquisitions by NHI of skilled nursing facilities are planned on a selective basis, with emphasis on operator quality and newer construction.\nHoliday\nThe significant items affecting revenues and expenses are described below (in thousands):\nadditional funding of up to $1,900,000 in capital improvements, and the lease provides for incentives of $5,000,000 to become available beginning in 2020 upon the attainment of certain operating metrics. NHI will have a right of first offer on two additional Wingate-operated facilities. We accounted for the transaction as an asset purchase.\nLiquidity\nMost of our existing leases contain annual escalators in rent payments. For financial statement purposes, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain of our operators hold purchase options allowing them to acquire properties they currently lease from NHI. For options open or coming open in the short term, we are engaged in negotiations to continue as lessor or in some other capacity.\nFFO and normalized FFO are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative, and should be supplemented with a measure such as FFO. The term FFO was designed by the REIT industry to address this issue.\nOur normalized FAD for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $16,395,000 (8.3%) over the same period in 2017 due primarily to the impact of real estate investments completed during 2017 and 2018. In addition to the adjustments included in the calculation of normalized AFFO, normalized FAD excludes the impact of non-cash stock based compensation. Normalized FAD is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT as a useful indicator of the ability to distribute dividends to shareholders. Additionally, normalized FAD improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with: (i) expected results, (ii) results of previous periods and (iii) results among REITs, more meaningful. Because FAD may function as a liquidity measure, we do not present FAD on a per-share basis.\nWe calculate our fixed charge coverage ratio as approximately 6.0x for the year ended December 31, 2018 (see our discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to our net income on page 52). Giving effect to our acquisitions and financings on an annualized basis, our consolidated net debt-to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is approximately 4.5x for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nOf our total revenues, $43,311,000 (15%), $43,817,000 (16%) and $43,817,000 (18%) were derived from Holiday for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, including $5,616,000, $7,397,000 and $8,965,000 in straight-line rent, respectively. Our tenant operates the facilities pursuant to a management agreement with a Holiday-affiliated manager.\nOn June 15, 2018, East Lake Capital Management LLC and certain related entities, including Regency, filed suit against NHI and NHI-REIT of Axel, LLC, in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas; 95th Judicial District for injunctive and declaratory relief and unspecified monetary damages, including attorney's fees. The suit sought, among other things, to enjoin NHI from making certain references to East Lake in NHI's public filings. In response to this lawsuit, related litigation, and other circumstances, we entered motions calling for the immediate appointment of a receiver and for pre-judgment possession, hearing, and bond.\nOperating Activities - Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 increased primarily as a result of the collection of lease and interest payments on new real estate and note investments completed during 2018 and 2017.\nThe following tables summarize information as of December 31, 2018 related to our outstanding commitments and contingencies which are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nPrior Year\n 1. the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and \nOther\nThe credit facility agreement requires that we calculate specified financial statement metrics and meet or exceed a variety of financial ratios, which are usual and customary in nature. These ratios are calculated quarterly and have been within required limits. The calculation of our leverage ratio involves intermediate determinations of our total indebtedness\u201d and of our total asset value,\u201d as defined. We are near the upper bounds delineated by Level 2 in the Interest Rate Schedule, above.\nIn other financing transactions during the year ended December 31, 2018, we undertook targeted open-market repurchases of certain of our convertible notes. Settlement of the notes requires management to allocate the consideration we ultimately pay between the debt component and the equity conversion feature as though they were separate instruments. The allocation is effected by fair valuing the debt component first, with any remainder allocated to the conversion feature. Amounts expended to settle the notes are recognized first as a settlement of the notes at our carrying value and then are recognized in income to the extent the portion allocated to the debt instrument differs from carrying value. The remainder of the allocation, if any, is treated as settlement of equity and adjusted through our capital in excess of par account.\nComfort Care\n\nFinancial highlights of the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016 were as follows:\n\nFor a discussion of incentive loan draws of $8,000,000 available to Bickford related to borrowings for the development of its properties in Illinois, Michigan, and Virginia, see page 34 of Investment Highlights.\nAs of December 31, 2018 our Bickford lease portfolio is structured as follows (in thousands):\nNormalized AFFO is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT. GAAP requires a lessor to recognize contractual lease payments into income on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease. This straight-line adjustment has the effect of reporting lease income that is significantly more or less than the contractual cash flows received pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement. GAAP also requires the original issue discount of our convertible senior notes and debt issuance costs to be amortized as non-cash adjustments to earnings. Normalized AFFO is useful to our investors as it reflects the growth inherent in the contractual lease payments of our real estate portfolio.\nFluctuations in portfolio coverage are a result of market and economic trends, local market competition, and regulatory factors as well as the operational success of our tenants. We use the results of individual leases to inform our decision making with respect to specific tenants, but trends described above by property type and operator bear analysis. Our Need-Driven SHO portfolio shows a decline brought about primarily by a softening in occupancy within particular markets, as well as rising wage pressures. For many of the affected operators, as is typical of our portfolio in general, NHI has significant security deposits in place and/or corporate guarantees should actual cash rental shortfalls eventually materialize. In certain instances, our operators may elect to increase their security deposits with us in an amount equal to the coverage shortfall, and, upon subsequent compliance with the required lease coverage ratio, the operator would then be entitled to a full refund. The metrics presented in the tables above give no effect to the presence of these security deposits. For Skilled Nursing, coverage in the All Other segment of our portfolio has improved due to a better operating environment for the segment, as a whole, and for the Ensign portfolio transition, in particular. Each MOB's coverage is driven by the underlying performance of its on-campus hospital as the tenant or guarantor under the lease. In Texas, the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 witnessed the shut-down of the guarantor hospital for a few days resulting in lost revenue, overtime and other one-time charges, negatively impacting the hospital's bottom-line and\nAt December 31, 2018, we had investments in real estate, mortgage and other notes receivable involving 232 facilities located in 33 states. These investments involve 151 senior housing properties, 76 skilled nursing facilities, 3 hospitals, 2 medical office buildings and other notes receivable. These investments (excluding our corporate office of $2,471,000) consisted of properties with an original cost of $2,815,894,000, rented under triple-net leases to 30 lessees, and $246,111,000 aggregate carrying value of mortgage and other notes receivable due from 10 borrowers.\nOur primary sources of cash include rent payments, principal and interest payments on mortgage and other notes receivable, interest and dividends received on our marketable securities, proceeds from the sales of real property, net proceeds from offerings of equity securities and borrowings from our term loans and revolving credit facility. Our primary uses of cash include debt service payments (both principal and interest), new investments in real estate and notes, dividend distributions to our shareholders and general corporate overhead.\nStraight-line rent of $5,436,000 and $6,984,000 was recognized from the Senior Living lease for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Straight-line rent of $5,028,000 and $5,102,000 was recognized from the Bickford leases for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Straight-line rent of $5,616,000 and $7,397,000 was recognized from the Holiday lease for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In November 2018, we announced an agreement with Holiday to receive approximately $65,762,000 in specified cash and other consideration in exchange for a reduced annual rental payment for the existing 25 properties, beginning at $31,500,000 for 2019, as discussed below under the heading Other Portfolio Activity. For NHC, rent escalations are based on a percentage increase in revenue over a base year and do not give rise to non-cash, straight-line rental income.\nOf our total revenues, $5,540,000 (2%), $6,141,000 (2%), and $1,957,000 (1%) in lease revenues were derived from the above tenants for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOn January 1, 2018 we adopted ASU 2017-12 Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, as discussed in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. The transition method is a modified retrospective approach that required the Company to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of 2018. The primary provision in the ASU requiring adjustment to our beginning retained earnings is the change in timing and income statement line item for ineffectiveness related to cash flow hedges. Upon the adoption of the new standard, we reversed cumulative ineffectiveness occurring in the last six months of 2017, resulting in a retroactive net charge to retained earnings and a credit to accumulated other comprehensive income of $235,000 as of January 1, 2018. Upon adoption of the ASU, the Company achieved a better alignment of its financial reporting for hedging activities with the economic objectives of those activities.\nWe currently have no outstanding guarantees. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, our leases, mortgages and other notes receivable with certain entities represent variable interests in those enterprises. However, because we do not control these entities, nor do we have any role in their day-to-day management, we are not their primary beneficiary. Except as discussed below under Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities, we have no further material obligations arising from our transactions with these entities, and we believe our maximum exposure to loss at December 31, 2018, due to this involvement would be limited to our contractual commitments and contingent liabilities and the amount of our current investments with them, as detailed further in in Notes 1, 2, 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements.\n1 NHC based on corporate-level fixed-charge coverage and includes 3 independent living facilities\nOn January 15, 2019, we acquired a 267-unit senior living campus in Massachusetts for a purchase price of $50,300,000, including closing costs of $300,000. The facility is being leased to Wingate Healthcare, Inc. ( Wingate\u201d) for a term of 10 years, with three five-year renewal options, at an initial lease rate of 7.5% plus annual fixed escalators. We have committed to the\nAnother of our tenants, The LaSalle Group, with five buildings in Illinois and Texas, is in material non-compliance with provisions of our lease regarding mandated coverage ratios, working capital requirements and timeliness of rent payments. Lease revenues from the tenant have comprised less than 2% of our rental income, and the tenant is two months in arrears on its rent payments to us as of December 31, 2018. As of October 31, 2018, we wrote off the accumulated straight-line rent receivable of $1,496,000, we ceased recording straight-line rent income, and we adopted the cash basis for recognition of revenues from this tenant. We have made no rent concessions to the tenant as of December 31, 2018, and we are pursuing our remedies to the full extent of our agreements. The tenant has requested forbearance, though no assurance can be given as of the date of this filing that an effective forbearance agreement can be reached.\nAdditional disclosure requirements also give widely ranging results depending on market price variability. The notes will be freely convertible in the last six months of their contractual life, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020; however, generally accepted accounting principles require us to periodically report the amount by which the notes' convertible value exceeds their principal amount, without regard to the current availability of the conversion feature. Further, the mechanics of the calculation require the use of an end-of-period stock price, so that using that amount for the remaining notes outstanding of $120,000,000 at December 31, 2018, delivers an excess of $10,697,000, whereas the use of another price point would give a different result.\nAffiliates of East Lake\nFFO, AFFO & FAD\nOur bank credit facility derives from agreements entered into in August 2017 and September 2018. Together these agreements establish our unsecured $1,100,000,000 bank credit facility, which consists of $250,000,000 and $300,000,000 term loans and a $550,000,000 revolving credit facility. The $250,000,000 term loan and $550,000,000 revolving facility mature in August 2022, and the $300,000,000 term loan matures in September 2023. With the 2018 Agreement, we converted $300,000,000 of debt initially drawn on our revolving facility into a five-year term loan.\nThe construction loans are secured by first mortgage liens on substantially all real and personal property as well as a pledge of any and all leases or agreements which may grant a right of use to the subject property. Usual and customary covenants extend to the agreements, including the borrower's obligation for payment of insurance and taxes. NHI has a purchase option on the properties at stabilization, whereby the lease rate will be set with a floor of 9.55%, based on NHI's total investment, plus fixed\nfeature as though they were separate instruments. The allocation is effected by valuing the debt component first, with any remainder allocated to the conversion feature. Amounts expended to settle the notes will be recognized first as a settlement of the notes at par and then will be recognized in income to the extent the portion allocated to the debt instrument differs from par value. The remainder of the allocation, if any, will be treated as settlement of equity and adjusted through our paid in capital account.\nOn December 21, 2018 we entered into an agreement to lend LCS-Westminster Partnership IV LLP ( Life Care Services IV\u201d), an affiliate of Life Care Services, the manager of the facility, up to $180,000,000. The loan agreement conveys a mortgage interest and will facilitate the construction of Phase II of Sagewood, a Type-A Continuing Care Retirement Community in Scottsdale, AZ.\n \u2022 Loan and realty losses of $15,856,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 relate to non-cash transactional write-offs involving the acquisition of eight skilled nursing facilities from Legend and transition of a total of 15 SNF leases to Ensign in the second quarter of 2016, and the non-cash write-off of straight-line rent receivable during the third quarter of 2016 resulting from a tenant's material non-compliance with our lease terms which, as of October 1, 2017, NHI has transitioned to another tenant. \nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nLitigation\nThe long-term health care industry has experienced significant professional liability claims which have resulted in an increase in the cost of insurance to cover potential claims. In previous years, these factors have combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings, bankruptcy court rulings and court judgments affecting our lessees and borrowers. In prior years, we have determined that impairment of certain of our loan investments had occurred as a result of these events.\nThe original libel action of the East Lake affiliated entities survives the Rule 11 agreement and is set to continue in January 2019. NHI is not precluded from further action in damages under terms of the lease.\nEnsign\nThe following tables summarize our investments in real estate and mortgage and other notes receivable as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nThe table above does not include indirect legal and accounting costs of $263,000 for 2017 and $217,000 for 2018 associated with updating and maintaining our shelf registration statement.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 27% of our revenue was derived from operators of our skilled nursing facilities that receive a significant portion of their revenue from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. Such revenues are subject annually to statutory and regulatory changes and in recent years have been reduced due to federal and state budgetary pressures. Over the past five years, we have selectively diversified our portfolio by directing a significant portion of our investments into properties which do not rely primarily on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, but rather on private pay sources (assisted living and memory care facilities, senior living campuses, independent living facilities and entrance-fee communities). We will occasionally acquire skilled nursing facilities in good physical condition with a proven operator and strong local market fundamentals, because diversification implies a periodic rebalancing, but our recent investment focus has been on acquiring need-driven and discretionary senior housing assets.\nIt is possible that consolidation will also result from our interactions and negotiations with any of the operators of the other properties discussed above, however, the nature and form of any agreements that will result from this process are unknown at this time.\n1 Interest is calculated based on the weighted average interest rate of outstanding debt balances as of December 31, 2018. The calculation also includes a commitment fee of.20%.\nWhen present, tenant purchase options generally give the lessee an option to purchase the underlying property for consideration determined by i) a sliding base dependent upon the extent of appreciation in the property plus a specified proportion of any appreciation; ii) our acquisition costs plus a specified proportion of any appreciation; iii) an agreed capitalization rate applied to the current rental; or iv) our acquisition costs plus a profit floor plus a specified proportion of any appreciation.\nFor operations which we place in our Taxable REIT Subsidiary ( TRS\u201d), we have NOL carryforwards of $462,000 available to offset taxable income in the TRS. The carry-forwards expire beginning in 2028.\nAccording to the Administration on Aging ( AoA\u201d) of the US Department of Health and Human Services, in 2016, the latest year for which data is available, 49.2 million people were age 65 or older in the United States (a 33% increase over the last ten years). Census estimates showed that, by 2040, those 65 or older are expected to constitute 21.7% of the population. The population aged 85 and above is projected to rise from 6.4 million in 2016 to 14.6 million in the US by 2040 (a 129% increase).\n \u2022 NHI and Holiday are reviewing the portfolio to identify underperforming properties within the existing Holiday lease. A subsequent sale of properties, if any, would reduce the rent owed us by 7.0% of the net proceeds received by NHI. Stated levels of our security deposit and tenant Credit Enhancement will not be adjusted as a result of any future sale. \nUtilization of Tenant Escrow Deposits\nWe intend to comply with REIT dividend requirements that we distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2018 and thereafter. Dividends declared for the fourth quarter of each fiscal year are paid by the end of the following January and are, with some exceptions, treated for tax purposes as having been paid in the fiscal year just ended as provided in IRS Code Sec. 857(b)(8). We declare special dividends when we compute our REIT taxable income in an amount that exceeds our regular dividends for the fiscal year.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values of our properties on a property-by-property basis. On a quarterly basis, we review our properties for recoverability when events or circumstances, including significant physical changes in the property, significant adverse changes in general economic conditions and significant deteriorations of the underlying cash flows of the property, indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable. The need to recognize an impairment charge is based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of that property. If recognition of an impairment charge is necessary, it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the fair value of the property.\nThe results by asset type are presented below on a trailing twelve-month basis, as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 (the most recent periods available):\n \u2022 Investment and other gains for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $10,038,000 from the sale of marketable securities. \nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with REIT requirements. Our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. We believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will be able to so qualify at all times. Until September 30, 2016, we operated a taxable REIT subsidiary under a joint venture structured to comply with the provisions of the RIDEA through which we invested in facility operations managed by independent third-parties. On September 30, 2016, NHI and Bickford entered into a definitive agreement terminating the joint venture. In the past we recorded income tax expense or benefit with respect to the subsidiary which was taxed under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations. Aside from such income taxes that may have been applicable to the taxable income in our taxable REIT subsidiary, we are not subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that we continue to qualify as a REIT and make distributions to stockholders equal to or in excess of our taxable income. This treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation\u201d (at the corporate and stockholder levels) that typically applies to corporate dividends. Our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable REIT qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n \u2022 Payroll and related compensation expenses increased $2,080,000 due primarily to the addition of new corporate employees and the expense of certain incentive bonuses. \nResulting from these claims and counterclaims, on December 6, 2018, the plaintiff parties entered into an agreement with NHI under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which rule ensures the enforceability of an agreement between lawyers in a case when the agreement is in writing and filed in the papers of the court. The agreement provided that Regency vacate our facilities in Indiana and North Carolina on December 7, 2018 and in Tennessee on December 14, 2018. Further, Regency agreed to provide minimal levels of cooperation in transitioning the facilities.\nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) guidance for our arrangements with VIEs which requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. We may change our assessment of a VIE due to events such as modifications of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity's equity investments at risk and the disposal of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary.\nWe began liquidating our position in LTC Properties, Inc. ( LTC\u201d) common stock in the fourth quarter of 2015. We realized taxable gains of $10,038,000 and $29,673,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nREIT Qualification\n\nThe following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of National Health Investors, Inc. for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other important factors are identified in Item 1. Business\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d above.\n \u2022 Investment and other gains for the year ended December 31, 2017 consist of $10,038,000 from the sale of marketable securities. For the year ended December 31, 2016, investment and other gains include $29,673,000 from the sale of marketable securities, $2,805,000 from the sale of two Texas skilled nursing facilities, $1,654,000 from the sale of an Idaho skilled nursing facility, $123,000 from the sale of a vacant land parcel in Alabama and $1,657,000 recorded as a gain on the sale of our 85% non-controlling interest in OpCo. \nFor instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative has been reported as a component of other comprehensive income ( OCI\u201d), and reclassified into earnings in the same period, or periods, during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness have been recognized in earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness related to our cash flow hedges, which is reported in current period earnings as interest expense, was not significant in 2016. With the amendment of our bank credit facility in August 2017, discussed above, the introduction to the debt instrument of a LIBOR floor not present in the hedges resulted in hedge inefficiency of approximately $353,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, which we credited to interest expense.\nWe may continue from time to time to seek to retire or purchase some of our outstanding convertible notes through cash open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. As with our 2018 repurchases, amounts and timing of further repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be dependent on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nThese sources and uses of cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as summarized below (dollars in thousands):\nWe will amortize to income the net proceeds received from Holiday under the Agreement so that cash or other consideration received in 2019 will be adjusted to deferred revenue/expense, resulting in the recognition of annual revenues from this lease through 2035 of $37,748,000 on a straight-line basis. From 2019 through June 2022 we will include the deferred revenue balance of the straight-line payable for this lease among other liabilities on our balance sheet. After June 2022, cumulative straight-line amortization of the deferred revenue/expense associated with the Holiday lease will result in the more typical asset balance.\nOur tenants and borrowers who operate SNFs derive their revenues primarily from Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs. Amounts paid under these government programs are subject to legislative and government budget constraints. From time to time, there may be material changes in government reimbursement. In the past, SNFs have experienced material reductions in government reimbursement.\nresultant coverage ratios for that MOB. Within the context of this event-specific occurrence, it is also typical of MOB operations that there may be other large fluctuations in coverage resulting from hospital operations.\nWhen we take on new debt or when we modify or replace existing debt, we incur debt issuance costs. These costs are subject to amortization over the term of the new debt instrument and may result in the write-off of fees associated with debt which has been replaced or modified. Sustaining long-term dividend growth will require that we consider all sources of capital mentioned above, with the goal of maintaining a low-leverage balance sheet as mitigation against potential adverse changes in the business of our industry, tenants and borrowers.\nannual escalators. On these and future loan development projects, Bickford as the borrower is entitled to up to $2,000,000 per project in incentive loan draws based upon the achievement of predetermined operational milestones, the funding of which will increase the principal amount, NHI's future purchase price under option and, upon exercise, eventual lease payment to NHI.\nIn October 2017, we issued a letter of forbearance to one of our tenants for a default on our lease terms involving coverage and liquidity ratios. Rent payments to NHI are current as of December 31, 2018. Lease revenues from the tenant and its affiliates comprise 3% of our rental income, and the related straight-line rent receivable was approximately $4,566,000 at December 31, 2018. NHI's ongoing monitoring from 2017 through 2018 indicated that the tenant's operations and financial position have continued to improve, and in February 2019 we released them from provisions of the forbearance letter.\nFor all periods presented, EBITDA reflects GAAP interest expense, which excludes amounts capitalized during the period.\n\nNational Health Investors, Inc., established in 1991 as a Maryland corporation, is a self-managed REIT specializing in sale-leaseback, joint-venture, mortgage and mezzanine financing of need-driven and discretionary senior housing and medical investments. Our portfolio consists of lease, mortgage and other note investments in independent living facilities, assisted living facilities, entrance-fee communities, senior living campuses, skilled nursing facilities, specialty hospitals and medical office buildings. Other investments have included marketable securities and, until 2016, a joint venture structured to comply with the provisions of the REIT Investment Diversification Empowerment Act of 2007 ( RIDEA\u201d) through which we invested in facility operations managed by an independent third-party. We have funded our real estate investments primarily through: (1) operating cash flow, (2) debt offerings, including bank lines of credit and term debt, both unsecured and secured, and (3) the sale of equity securities.\ninterest is not probable of collection until received, our policy is to recognize rental or interest income when assured, which we consider to be the period in which cash is received or accrued on the basis of tenant security deposits available to us for the recognition of lease revenue in the period in which it was earned. We identify investments as nonperforming if a required payment is not received within 30 days of the date it is due. This policy could cause our revenues to vary significantly from period to period. Rental income from minimum lease payments under our leases is recognized on a straight-line basis to the extent that future lease payments are considered collectible. Lease payments that depend on a factor directly related to future use of the property, such as an increase in annual revenues over base year revenues, are considered to be contingent rentals and are included in rental income when they are determinable and earned.\nWe believe that the current carrying amounts of our real estate properties are recoverable and that mortgage notes receivable are realizable and supported by the value of the underlying collateral. However, it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments to these carrying amounts.\nOn April 30, 2018, we acquired an assisted living/memory-care portfolio in Ohio and Pennsylvania totaling 320 units and comprising five facilities, one of which is subject to a ground lease with remaining term, including extensions, of 50 years. The purchase price was $69,750,000, inclusive of $500,000 in closing costs and $1,750,000 in specified capital improvements, which will be added to the lease base upon funding. In addition to the cash consideration stated above, we recorded an intangible liability of $590,000 to recognize our above-market obligation for the ground lease. We included this portfolio in a separate master lease with Bickford which provides for a lease rate of 6.85%, with annual fixed escalators over a term of 15 years plus renewal options, subject to a fair market value rent reset feature available to NHI between years three and five.\nIn December 2018, we reached an agreement with Ignite Team Partners, LLC, d/b/a Ignite Medical Resorts, to develop a $25,350,000 skilled nursing facility in suburban Milwaukee. The facility is currently under construction with an expected opening date in the fourth quarter of 2019. The facility will be leased to Ignite Healthcare, Inc. ( Ignite\u201d) for a term of 12 years, with two ten-year renewal options, at an initial lease rate of 9.5% plus annual fixed escalators. Ignite will be eligible for an earn-out of up to $2,000,000, to be funded beginning in 2026 upon the attainment of specified metrics. NHI will have a right of first offer on future Ignite projects. We accounted for the transaction as an asset purchase. At December 31, 2018, we had funded $4,674,000, including $2,000,000 for the purchase of land.\nApart from operations, a primary source of our liquidity is our unsecured bank credit facility. At December 31, 2018, we had $466,000,000 available to draw on our revolving credit facility.\nNHI's at-the-market ( ATM\u201d) offerings were initially made pursuant to a prospectus dated March 18, 2014, and a related prospectus supplement dated February 17, 2015, which constitute a part of our effective shelf registration statement that was previously filed with the SEC. We filed a new registration statement and commenced a new ATM program effective February 22, 2017. The following table summarizes the issuances since inception on our ATM as of December 31, 2018:\n24 months and selected immaterial properties identified in 2019 as available for sale.For stabilized acquisitions in the portfolio less than 24 months and renewing leases with changes in scheduled rent, we include pro forma cash rent. For this reporting period, we have excluded results from SH Regency Leasing, LLC, as noted below under the heading Other Portfolio Activity.\nOn January 12, 2018, NHI acquired from a developer a 121-bed skilled nursing facility in Waxahachie, Texas for a cash investment of $14,404,000, and in May, we acquired from another developer two 132-bed skilled nursing facilities in Garland and Fort Worth, Texas, for a cash investment totaling $29,000,000. Additional consideration of $1,275,000 for the Waxahachie property and $1,250,000 for each of Garland and Ft. Worth were contributed by the lessee, The Ensign Group ( Ensign\u201d). We have capitalized the tenant contributions as a component of the cost of the facilities and have recorded the contributions as deferred revenue, which we are amortizing to revenue over the term of the master lease to which these properties have now been added. The remaining term of the master lease extends through April 2031, plus renewal options. The blended initial lease rate is set at 8.1%, subject to annual escalators based on prevailing inflation rates. The acquisitions were accounted for as asset purchases and fulfill our original commitment to acquire and lease to Ensign four skilled nursing facilities in New Braunfels, Waxahachie, Garland and Fort Worth, Texas.\n \u2022 Depreciation expense increased $4,176,000 primarily due to new real estate investments completed during 2018 and 2017. \n\n \u2022 Effective January 1, 2019, Holiday rent was reset to $31,500,000 for the existing 25 properties, as opposed to the $39,000,000 previously obligated, with escalators commencing annually November 1, 2020, equal to the greater of 2.0% or 45% of trailing 12 months year-over-year revenue growth of the NHI/Holiday portfolio, not to exceed 3.0%. \n \u2022 We have committed to invest up to $5,000,000 in capital expenditures into the communities at a 7.0% lease rate on funds drawn. In addition, Holiday has committed to a minimum of $1,500 per unit in annual capital expenditures. \n\nWe consider an accounting estimate or assumption critical if:\n\nOur operators report to us the results of their operations on a periodic basis, which we in turn subject to further analysis as a means of monitoring potential concerns within our portfolio. We have identified EBITDARM (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees) as the most elemental barometer of success for our tenants, based on results they have reported to us. We believe EBITDARM is useful in our most fundamental analyses, as it is a property level measure of our operators' success, by eliminating the effects of the operator's method of acquiring the use of its assets (interest and rent), its non-cash expenses (depreciation and amortization), expenses that are dependent on its level of success (income taxes), and also excluding the effect of the operator's payment of its management fees, as typically those fees are contractually subordinate to our lease payment. For operators of our entrance-fee communities, our calculation of EBITDARM includes other cash flow adjustments typical of the industry which may include, but are not limited to, net cash flows from entrance fees; amortization of deferred entrance fees; adjustments for tenant rent obligations, depreciation and amortization; and management fee true-ups. The eliminations and adjustments reflect covenants in our leases and provide a comparable basis for assessing our various relationships\nAs of December 31, 2018, we leased 25 independent living facilities to an affiliate of Holiday Retirement ( Holiday\u201d) at an original cost of $493,000,000. The 17-year master lease began in December 2013 and provides for a minimum annual escalator of 3.5% after 2017.\nIn November 2018, we entered into a lease amendment and guaranty release ( the Agreement\u201d) with Holiday. The Agreement extends the term of the lease, increases required minimum capital expenditure per unit and provides NHI with stronger projected 2019 lease coverage ratio. Below is a summary of the provisions of the new agreement:\nOther Lease Portfolio Activity\nAs of December 31, 2018, our contractual payment obligations were as follows (in thousands):\n\nContractual Obligations\nInterest Rate Schedule\n \u2022 Loan and realty losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulted primarily from $4,752,000 of straight-line rent receivable write-downs including $1,436,000 related to a Wisconsin property, $1,820,000 from our SH Regency portfolio and $1,496,000 from a Midwest portfolio, as well as a $363,000 write-down of a note receivable. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n \u2022 The agreement provided that, in lieu of cash mentioned above, we could have sole discretion to acquire a Holiday property that will be leased back to Holiday at an agreed-upon rent and subject to the same terms and conditions of the amended master lease. On January 31, 2019, we acquired a senior housing facility in Vero Beach, Florida as discussed in Note 15. \nAs of December 31, 2018, based on our assessment of likely undiscounted cash flows we determined no impairment charge was required on the land, building and improvements formerly leased to Regency. We wrote off straight-line receivables from the Regency properties totaling $1,820,000 during the fourth quarter of 2018 and included this amount in loan and realty losses in our consolidated statement of income.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations - AFFO\nTotal expenditures of $29,985,000 include paid amounts of $27,558,000 allocated to the note retirement with the remaining expenditure of $2,427,000 allocated to capital in excess of par. A loss of $738,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, resulted from the excess of cash expenditures over the book value of the notes retired, net of discount and issuance costs.\n\nOf our total revenues, $5,103,000 (2%), $5,466,000 (2%), and $5,444,000 (2%) in lease revenues were derived from Regency for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWe manage our business with a goal of increasing the regular annual dividends paid to shareholders. Our Board of Directors approves a regular quarterly dividend which is reflective of expected taxable income on a recurring basis. Our transactions that are infrequent and non-recurring that generate additional taxable income have been distributed to shareholders in the form of special dividends. Taxable income is determined in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and differs from net income for\nThe revolving facility fee is currently 20 basis points per annum, and floating interest on the revolver and term loans are presently set at 30-day LIBOR (252 bps at December 31, 2018) plus 115 and a blended 127 basis points, respectively. Within the facility, the employment of interest rate swaps for our fixed term debt leaves only our revolving credit facility and newly issued term loan of $300,000,000 exposed to interest rate risk through April 2019, when our $40,000,000 swap expires. Our swaps and the financial instruments to which they relate are described later in this section. The current interest spreads and facility fee reflect our leverage-ratio compliance based on the applicable margin for LIBOR loans, measuring debt to Total Asset Value,\u201d at Level 2 in the Interest Rate Schedule provided below in abridged format:\nFinancing Activities - The use of cash in financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 resulted primarily from the excess of dividend payments over proceeds from equity offerings, the impact of other large transactions primarily being the restructuring of our debt.\n\nBased on our assessment of current operations and the availability of suitable operating partners, we may seek new tenants or managers for the other properties mentioned above. If we enter into a management agreement rather than a lease as we seek to stabilize the operations of these facilities and if our resulting operating partner does not have adequate liquidity to accept the risks and rewards of ownership, NHI might be deemed the primary beneficiary of the operations and might be required to consolidate those statements of financial position and results of operations of the managers or operating partners into our consolidated financial statements.\nA roll-forward of our convertible note balances, including the effect of year-to-date amortization, net of issuance costs, is presented below:\nWingate\nContingent lease inducement payments of $10,000,000 related to the five Bickford development properties constructed in 2016 and 2017 include a licensure incentive of $250,000 per property and a three-tiered operator incentive schedule paying up to an additional $1,750,000, based on the attainment of certain performance metrics. Upon funding, these payments are added to the lease base and amortized against rental income.\nThe significant items affecting revenues and expenses are described below (in thousands):\nThe determination of fair value and whether a shortfall in operating revenues or the existence of operating losses is indicative of a loss in value that is other than temporary involves significant judgment. Our estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and trends, the duration of the fair value deficiency, and any other relevant factors. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.\n \u2022 The lease maturity is extended by five years to December 31, 2035, and will be secured by the remaining half of the NHI-held security deposit. Additionally, NHI is requiring $5,000,000 of equity to be contributed by the parent into the Holiday tenant entity ( the Credit Enhancement\u201d). The use of the Credit Enhancement will be limited to payment of NHI rent and NHI-approved capital expenditures. Future return of the Credit Enhancement will further be limited by performance measures, including liquidity and lease service coverage ratio covenants. The Agreement also requires that $6,500,000 of equity be contributed to the Holiday management company. \nOur borrowers and tenants experience periods of significant financial pressures and difficulties similar to those encountered by other health care providers. Governments at both the federal and state levels have enacted legislation to lower, or at least slow, the growth in payments to health care providers. Furthermore, the cost of professional liability insurance has increased significantly during this same period. Since our inception in 1991, a number of our facility operators and mortgage loan borrowers have undergone bankruptcy. Others have been forced to surrender properties to us in lieu of foreclosure or, for certain periods, have failed to make timely payments on their obligations to us.\nWe expect that borrowings on our revolving credit facility, borrowings on term loans, and our ATM program will allow us to continue to make real estate investments during 2019. However, we anticipate that our historically low cost of debt capital will continue to rise in the near to mid-term, as the federal government prolongs the upward transitioning of the federal funds rate. In response to the changed interest-rate environment, we may find it advisable within the coming year to acquire a public credit rating as a tool for managing our interest costs.\n \u2022 Interest expense, including amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, increased $3,216,000 primarily as a result of an increase in 30-day LIBOR, which is the benchmark for our revolving debt, and the refinancing of $75,000,000 in September 2016 to an 8-year note with annual interest at 3.93%. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n \u2022 Rental income, before straight-line adjustments, increased $18,947,000, or 7.9%, primarily as a result of new investments and lease escalators in our existing portfolio. Generally, future increases in rental income depend on our ability to make new investments which meet our underwriting criteria. \nWe collect rent and interest from our tenants and borrowers. Generally, our policy is to recognize income on an accrual basis as earned. However, when we determine, based on current collections and the lack of expected future collections, that rent or\nFollowing three 25 basis-point increases in 2017, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve announced four further increases during 2018. As inflation is expected to rise, officials have forecast a total of two increases in 2019. However, the actual path the federal funds rate takes will depend on the changing economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The anticipation of past and further increases in the federal funds rate in 2018 and beyond has been a primary source of much volatility in REIT equity markets. As a result, there will be pressure on the spread between our cost of capital and the returns we earn. We expect that pressure to be partially mitigated by market forces that would tend to result in higher capitalization rates for healthcare assets and higher lease rates indicative of historical levels. Our cost of capital has increased over the past year as we transition some of our short term revolving borrowings into debt instruments with longer maturities and fixed interest rates. Managing long-term risk involves trade-offs with the competing alternative goal of maximizing short-term profitability. Our intention is to strike an appropriate balance between these competing interests within the context of our investor profile. As interest rates rise, our share price may decline as investors adjust prices to reflect a dividend yield that is sufficiently in excess of a risk-free rate.\nBeyond the applicable ratios detailed above, increasing levels of leverage (not shown) will subject our debt to defined increases in interest rates and fees.\nWe anticipate continued use of proceeds from the ATM program for general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions and repayment of indebtedness, including borrowings under our credit facility. Acquisitions, if any, whose magnitude would entail an equity match unable to be efficiently sourced through the ATM would likely trigger a prospectus supplement and an underwritten or overnight offering of NHI common stock, rather than placement through the ATM.\n \u2022 We are to receive consideration of approximately $65,762,000 consisting of a combination of cash and real estate equaling $55,125,000 and the forfeiture to us of $10,637,000 which is one-half of the original $21,275,000 security deposit. \nFunds Available for Distribution - FAD\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we have four lessees (including their affiliated entities, which are the legal tenants) from whom we individually derive at least 10% of our rental income as follows (dollars in thousands):\nOur SNF operators receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare (federal) and Medicaid (states). Changes in reimbursement rates and limits on the scope of services reimbursed to skilled nursing facilities could have a material impact on the operators' liquidity and financial condition. On August 1, 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) announced the CMS Skilled Nursing Prospective Payment System ( PPS\u201d) final rule whereby, effective October 1, 2019, its Patient-Driven Payment Model ( PDPM\u201d) will replace Resource Utilization Groups ( RUGs\u201d)-IV. Facilities will have one year to transition to PDPM from RUGs-IV by the October 1, 2019 implementation date. PDPM is designed as a more simplified payment model than RUGs-IV and is projected to reduce administrative costs and foster innovation to improve care to patients. Regulators forecast a $2 billion reduction in provider costs over 10 years as a result of simplified paperwork requirements for resident assessments. The new model shifts care delivery under Medicare away from fee-for-service, which in the past has based reimbursement on the amount of care provided, to focus on value-based care, which will base reimbursement on clinical complexity and the resident's conditions and care needs. The final rule also established a 2.4% market basket increase beginning October 1, 2018.\nThese supplemental operating performance measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other REITs. Consequently, our Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d), Normalized FFO, Normalized Adjusted Funds From Operations ( AFFO\u201d) and Normalized Funds Available for Distribution ( FAD\u201d) may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other REITs. Since other REITs may not use our definition of these operating performance measures, caution should be exercised when comparing our Company's FFO, Normalized FFO, Normalized AFFO and Normalized FAD to that of other REITs. These financial performance measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) (these measures do not include changes in operating assets and liabilities) and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance, or to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity, and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.\nFunds From Operations - FFO\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFor individual tenant revenue as a percentage of total lease revenue, Bickford is our largest assisted living tenant, an affiliate of Holiday is our largest independent living tenant, NHC is our largest skilled nursing tenant and Senior Living Communities is our largest entrance-fee community tenant. Our shift toward private payor facilities, as well as our expansion into the discretionary senior housing market, has further resulted in a portfolio whose current composition is relatively balanced between medical facilities, need-driven and discretionary senior housing.\nEquipped with the basics of financial security, many will be economically able to enter the market for senior housing. These strong demographic trends provide the context for continued growth in senior housing in 2019 and the years ahead. We plan to fund any new real estate and mortgage investments during 2019 using our liquid assets and debt financing. As the weight of additional debt resulting from new acquisitions suggests the need to rebalance our capital structure, we would then expect to access the capital markets through an at-the-market ( ATM\u201d) or other equity offering. Our disciplined investment strategy implemented through measured increments of debt and equity sets the stage for access to capital at the lowest possible rates, annual dividend growth, continued low leverage, a portfolio of diversified, high-quality assets, and business relationships with experienced operators whom we make our priority, continue to be the key drivers of our business plan.\nWe consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important supplemental measure because it provides information which we use to evaluate our performance and serves as an indication of our ability to service debt. We define Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including amounts in discontinued operations, excluding real estate asset impairments and gains on dispositions and certain items which may create some difficulty in comparing Adjusted EBITDA for the current period to similar prior periods, and may include, but are not limited to, impairment of non-real estate assets, gains and losses attributable to the acquisition and disposition of assets and liabilities, and recoveries of previous write-downs. Since others may not use our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, caution should be exercised when comparing our Adjusted EBITDA to that of other companies.\n\nEstimates\nBickford\nWe classify the properties in our portfolio as either senior housing or medical properties. We further classify our senior housing properties as either need-driven (assisted living facilities and senior living campuses) or discretionary (independent living facilities and entrance-fee communities). Medical properties within our portfolio include skilled nursing facilities, medical office buildings and specialty hospitals.\nThe following table reconciles net income attributable to common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP metric, to FFO, Normalized FFO, Normalized AFFO and Normalized FAD and is presented for both basic and diluted weighted average common shares (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nTraditionally, debt financing and cash resulting from operating and investing activities, which are derived from proceeds of lease and note collections, loan payoffs and the recovery of previous write-downs, have been used to satisfy our operational and investing needs and to provide a return to our shareholders. Those operational and investing needs reflect the resources necessary to maintain and cultivate our funding sources and have generally fallen into three categories: debt service, REIT operating expenses, and new real estate and note investments.\nOn June 15, 2018, East Lake Capital Management LLC and certain related entities, including Regency, filed suit against NHI and NHI-REIT of Axel, LLC, in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas; 95th Judicial District for injunctive and declaratory relief and unspecified monetary damages, including attorney's fees. The suit sought, among other things, to enjoin NHI from making certain references to East Lake in NHI's public filings. In response to this lawsuit, related litigation, and other circumstances, we entered motions calling for the immediate appointment of a receiver and for pre-judgment possession, hearing, and bond.\nCertain of our operators hold purchase options allowing them to acquire properties they currently lease from NHI. For options open or coming open in the near future, we are engaged in preliminary negotiations to continue as lessor or in some other capacity. A summary of these tenant options to purchase senior housing communities, hospitals, medical office buildings and skilled nursing facilities is presented below ($ in thousands):\nCommitments and Contingencies\nMajor Tenants\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our tenants who provided more than 3% of our total revenues were (parent company, in alphabetical order): Bickford Senior Living; Chancellor Health Care; The Ensign Group; Health Services Management; Holiday Retirement; National HealthCare Corporation; and Senior Living Communities.\nOur investments in healthcare real estate have been partially accomplished by our ability to effectively leverage our balance sheet. However, we continue to maintain a relatively low-leverage balance sheet compared with many in our peer group. We believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio, which is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including amounts in discontinued operations, excluding real estate asset impairments and gains on dispositions) to fixed charges (interest expense at contractual rates net of capitalized interest and principal payments on debt), and the ratio of consolidated net debt to Adjusted EBITDA are meaningful measures of our ability to service our debt. We use these two measures as a useful basis to compare the strength of our balance sheet with those in our peer group. We also believe this gives us a competitive advantage when accessing debt markets.\nFor our mortgage and other notes receivable, we evaluate the estimated collectibility of contractual loan payments and general economic conditions on an instrument-by-instrument basis. On a quarterly basis, we review our notes receivable for ability to realize on such notes when events or circumstances, including the non-receipt of contractual principal and interest payments, significant deteriorations of the financial condition of the borrower and significant adverse changes in general economic conditions, indicate that the carrying amount of the note receivable may not be recoverable. If necessary, impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value as measured by the discounted cash flows expected to be received under the note receivable or, if foreclosure is probable, the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable.\n\nThe loan takes the form of two notes under a master credit agreement. The senior note ( Note A\u201d) totals $118,800,000 at a 7.25% interest rate with 10 basis-point escalators after year three and has a term of 10 years. We have funded $76,653,000 of Note A as of December 31, 2018. Note A is interest-only and is locked to prepayment until January 2021. After 2020, the prepayment penalty starts at 2% and declines to 1% in 2022. The second note ( Note B\u201d) is a construction loan for up to $61,200,000 at an annual interest rate of 8.50% and carries a five-year maturity. We anticipate funding Note B through April 2020 and anticipate substantial repayment with new resident entrance fees upon the opening of Phase II. The total amount funded on Note B was $10,165,000 as of December 31, 2018.\nWith lower capitalization rates for existing healthcare facilities, there has been increased interest in constructing new facilities in hopes of generating better returns on invested capital. Using our relationship-driven model, we continue to look for opportunities to support new and existing tenants and borrowers with the capital needed to expand existing facilities and to initiate ground-up development of new facilities. We concentrate our efforts in those markets where there is both a demonstrated demand for a particular product type and where we perceive we have a competitive advantage. The projects we agree to finance have attractive upside potential and are expected to provide above-average returns to our shareholders to mitigate the risks inherent with property development and construction.\nOn September 30, 2016, NHI and Sycamore Street, LLC ( Sycamore\u201d), an affiliate of Bickford, entered into a definitive agreement terminating our joint venture which consisted of the ownership and operation of 40 properties and converting Bickford's participation to a triple-net tenancy with assumption of existing leases and terms. Through September 30, 2016, NHI owned an 85% equity interest and Sycamore owned a 15% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary, PropCo which owned 40 assisted living/memory care facilities, three new facilities and two facilities in development. The facilities had been leased to OpCo, in which NHI previously held a non-controlling 85% ownership interest. The facilities are managed by Bickford. The joint venture was structured to comply with the provisions of RIDEA. For the combined transaction, we recognized a gain of $1,657,000 on the sale of OpCo; we recognized $462,000 of income tax expense in applying a full valuation allowance to our state net operating loss carry-forwards on our Taxable REIT Subsidiary; Bickford's non-controlling interest was de-recognized; and the difference between the fair value of NHI's cost allocated to the redemption and the carrying amount of the 15% non-controlling interest was recorded as an adjustment to equity through additional-paid-in capital.\nSources and Uses of Funds\nReal Estate and Mortgage Write-downs\nExecutive Overview\nOur leases are typically structured as triple net leases\u201d on single-tenant properties having an initial leasehold term of 10 to 15 years with one or more 5-year renewal options. As such, there may be reporting periods in which we experience few, if any, lease renewals or expirations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not have any renewing or expiring leases.\nFinancial highlights of the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017 were as follows:\nSince January 1, 2018, we have made or announced the following real estate and note investments ($ in thousands):\n\nVIE Considerations\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOn May 31, 2018, NHI acquired two assisted living facilities comprising a total of 106 units in Bridgeport and Saginaw, Michigan for a cash investment of $17,140,000, inclusive of $100,000 in closing costs. We leased the facilities to affiliates of Comfort Care Senior Living ( Comfort Care\u201d) at an initial lease rate of 7.25% with annual escalators adjusted for prevailing inflation rates, subject to a floor and ceiling of 2% and 3%, respectively. The lease provides for an initial six-month cash escrow. With the acquisition, NHI also obtained fair value-based purchase options for two newly constructed facilities operated by Comfort Care, with the purchase option windows to open upon stabilization. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, our average effective annualized rental income was $8,421 per bed for SNFs, $17,105 per unit for ALFs, $13,883 per unit for ILFs, $21,573 per unit for EFCs, $44,150 per bed for hospitals, and $8 per square foot for MOBs.\nThe use of funds from our ATM and the liquidation of our position in LTC common stock effected a rebalancing of our leverage in response to our acquisitions and has kept our options flexible for further expansion. We continue to explore various other funding sources including bank term loans, convertible debt, traditional equity placement, unsecured bonds and senior notes, debt private placement and secured government agency financing. We view our ATM program as an effective way to match-fund our smaller acquisitions by exercising control over the timing and size of transactions and achieving a more favorable cost of capital as compared to larger follow-on offerings.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWhile we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties are recoverable and our notes receivable and other investments are realizable, it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates.\nIn documents we have previously filed with and furnished to the SEC, we have used the shorthand East Lake\u201d to refer to the East Lake Capital Management affiliated entities for whom we have acted or continue to act as landlord. These entities consist of\nThe original libel action of the East Lake affiliated entities survives the Rule 11 agreement and is set to continue in February 2019. NHI is not precluded from further action in damages under terms of the lease.", "item_7_text": "\nAreas of Focus\n \u2022 Rental income increased $32,774,000, or 14.1%, primarily as a result of new investments funded in 2017 and 2016. The increase in rental income included a $3,892,000 increase in straight-line rent adjustments. Generally accepted accounting principles require rental income to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease to give effect to scheduled rent escalators that are determinable at lease inception. Generally, future increases in rental income depend on our ability to make new investments which meet our underwriting criteria. \nWe have available to us a total of $3,485,000 in escrowed deposits for the above-mentioned non-compliant tenants. Through the end of 2018, we made no draws against these deposits. When tenants have been changed to cash basis and prior to adjudication of any amounts in controversy, we assess the probability of recovery, if any, through legal recourse against amounts on escrow. We consider available escrowed funds to the extent, under governing lease provisions, that specified costs incurred are to be borne by the tenant. Accordingly, we have recognized $2,534,000 as a receivable against these escrowed deposits to satisfy property tax liabilities and as reimbursement for expenses explicitly delineated under the leases.\n \u2022 The agreement calls for all conditions to be satisfied by late April 2019. \n \u2022 Interest income from mortgage and other notes decreased $671,000, due to a combination of the continued repayment of our construction loan to Timber Ridge, interest income received on development loans to Bickford Senior Living and Senior Living Management and the recognition of an unamortized note discount related to a mortgage note which was paid in full during the second quarter. \nAs of December 31, 2018, our senior unsecured convertible notes were convertible at a rate of 14.42 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount, representing a conversion price of approximately $69.36 per share for a total of 1,730,174 remaining underlying shares. For the year ended December 31, 2018, dilution resulting from the conversion option within our convertible debt is 80,123 shares. If NHI's current share price increases above the adjusted $69.36 conversion price, further dilution will be attributable to the conversion feature. On December 31, 2018, the value of the convertible debt, computed as if the debt were immediately eligible for conversion, exceeded its face amount by $10,697,000.\nRevenue Recognition\n\nSee Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for full details of our loan commitments. As provided above, loans funded do not include the effects of discounts or commitment fees. We expect to incrementally fund the LCS Sagewood Note A during 2019. Funding of the promissory note commitments to Bickford is expected to transpire monthly throughout 2019.\nIgnite\nPer the AoA, in 2015, the median value of homes owned by older homeowners age 75 and over was $150,000 (with a median purchase price of $53,000). In comparison, the median home value of all homeowners was $180,000. Of the 11.9 million households headed by persons age 75 and over in 2015, 76% were owners. About 78% of these older homeowners in 2015 owned their homes free and clear. Home ownership provides the elderly with greater freedom to choose their lifestyles.\nReal property we develop is recorded at cost, including the capitalization of interest during construction. The cost of real property investments we acquire is allocated to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their relative fair values. We make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. For properties acquired in transactions accounted for as asset purchases, the purchase price allocation is based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired. Cost includes the amount of contingent consideration, if any, deemed to be probable at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration is deemed to be probable to the extent that a significant reversal in amounts recognized is not likely to occur when the uncertainty associated with the contingent consideration is subsequently resolved. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to land, equipment, buildings and other improvements, and intangible assets, if any. Our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term.\nResults of Operations\nWith Regency's relinquishment of possession of the three NHI facilities as discussed above, our prospective entry into management agreements with operators willing to venture into speculative operations entails structuring the agreements so that NHI, who stands to gain the most from rehabilitation of the properties, will likely expect to absorb most of the losses, if any, that these operators will encounter during revitalization of operations at the three properties. As a result of finalizing these agreements, entity-level operations at each facility may be considered variable interests, the operators may be considered variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d), and NHI may potentially be considered the primary beneficiary of those entities. Consequently, NHI may be required to consolidate these operations in 2019. If so, we expect that our statements of income will reflect revenues and expenses from these foreclosed operations. During 2018, activities at these facilities were immaterial to the results of NHI's operations.\nOur normalized AFFO per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $0.29 (6.1%) over the same period in 2017 due primarily to the impact of real estate investments completed during 2017 and 2018. In addition to the adjustments included in the calculation of normalized FFO, normalized AFFO excludes the impact of any straight-line rent revenue, amortization of the original issue discount on our convertible senior notes and amortization of debt issuance costs.\n\n\nRIDEA\nOur loans to Bickford represent a variable interest as do our leases which are considered analogous to financing arrangements. Bickford is structured to limit liability for potential claims for damages, is capitalized to achieve that purpose and is considered a VIE.\nTo mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk, we have in place the following interest rate swap contracts in place to hedge against floating rates on our $250,000,000 bank term loan as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nfinancial statements purposes determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our goal of increasing annual dividends requires a careful balance between identification of high-quality lease and mortgage assets in which to invest and the cost of our capital with which to fund such investments. We consider the competing interests of short and long-term debt (interest rates, maturities and other terms) versus the higher cost of new equity. We accept some level of risk associated with leveraging our investments. We intend to continue to make new investments that meet our underwriting criteria and where the spreads over our cost of capital will generate sufficient returns to our shareholders.\n \u2022 Interest income from mortgage and other notes increased $309,000, due to interest income received on development loans to Bickford Senior Living which was partially offset by the continued repayment of our construction loan to the Timber Ridge project and mortgage note payoffs recorded in 2017. \nAside from a more favorable rate, the 2018 Agreement generally calls for the same covenants and financial statement metrics required for compliance with terms of the 2017 Agreement. Although we are currently eligible under both agreements to transact in our unsecured bank credit facilities at the respective scheduled rates represented by Level 2, the movement of our leverage ratio into Level 3 at current levels of debt would result in additional annual costs of approximately $375,000, assuming an average revolver balance of approximately $200,000,000. Further movement of our leverage ratio beyond levels currently contemplated by management would be subject to escalating increases in interest. If, in addition to changes in the leverage ratio, certain qualitative indicators of our risk profile were to materially change, further interest-rate escalations may result.\nThe following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable GAAP metric, to Adjusted EBITDA:\n\nResulting from these claims and counterclaims, on December 6, 2018, the plaintiff parties entered into an agreement with NHI under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which rule ensures the enforceability of an agreement between lawyers in a case when the agreement is in writing and filed in the papers of the court. As provided by the agreement, Regency vacated our facilities in Indiana and North Carolina on December 7, 2018 and in Tennessee on December 14, 2018. Due to a decrease in occupancy and the deferral of needed maintenance and capital expenditures related to their operation, NHI made arrangements with operators to manage the three facilities. NHI will receive 95% of operating cash flow, if any, as generated by the facilities until such time as operations become stabilized or more formal agreements are entered into.\nEL FW Intermediary I, LLC (for the Freshwater/Watermark continuing care retirement communities) and SH Regency Leasing, LLC (for the three assisted living facilities in Tennessee, Indiana and North Carolina referred to as Regency\u201d).\nPortfolio\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. If actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.\nWe believe that EBITDARM is a useful way to analyze the cash potential of a group of assets. From EBITDARM we calculate a lease coverage ratio (EBITDARM/Cash Rent), measuring the ability of the operator to meet its monthly rental obligation. In addition to EBITDARM and the lease coverage ratio, we rely on, a careful balance sheet analysis, and other analytical procedures to help us identify potential areas of concern relative to our operators' ability to generate sufficient liquidity to meet their obligations, including their obligation to continue to pay the rent due to us. Typical among our operators is a varying lag in reporting to us the results of their operations. Across our portfolio, however, our operators report their results, at the latest, within ninety days of month's end. For computational purposes, we exclude development and lease-up properties that have been in operation less than\nIn March 2014 we issued $200,000,000 of convertible notes, the conversion feature being intended to broaden the Company's credit profile and as a means to obtain a more favorable coupon rate. For this feature we calculate the dilutive effect using market prices prevailing over the reporting period. Because the dilution calculation is market-driven, and per share guidance we provide is based on diluted amounts, the theoretical effects of the conversion feature result in per share unpredictability.\nValuations and Impairments\nWith Regency's relinquishment of possession of the three NHI facilities as discussed above, our prospective entry into management agreements with operators willing to venture into speculative operations entails structuring the agreements so that NHI, who stands to gain the most from rehabilitation of the properties, will likely expect to absorb most of the losses, if any, that these operators will encounter during revitalization of operations at the three properties. As a result of finalizing these agreements, entity-level operations at each facility may be considered variable interests, the operators may be considered variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d), and NHI may potentially be considered the primary beneficiary of those entities. Consequently, NHI may be required to consolidate these operations in 2019. If so, we expect that our statements of income will reflect revenues and expenses from these foreclosed operations. During 2018, activities at these facilities were immaterial to the results of NHI's operations.\nConcurrent with the amendments to our credit facility and with the exception of specific debt-coverage ratios, covenants pertaining to our private placement term loans were generally conformed with those governing the credit facility.\nTenant Purchase Options\n\nIn the second quarter of 2018, we identified a single-property lease with a tenant in Wisconsin as non-performing. Lease revenues from the tenant have comprised less than 1% of our rental income, and the tenant is two months, or $840,000, in arrears on its rent payments to us as of December 31, 2018. In accordance with our revenue recognition policies, we will recognize future rental income from the lease in the period in which cash is received. Additionally, we may transition the lease to a new tenant. As a consequence of this course of action, the related straight-line receivable is considered uncollectible. Accordingly, in June 2018, we wrote off the balance of $1,436,000 pertaining to this tenant, included this amount in loan and realty losses in our consolidated statement of income and we ceased recording straight-line rent income. Personal guarantees totaling $3,000,000 remain in place.\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the accounts of joint ventures in which we own a majority voting interest with the ability to control operations and where no substantive participating rights or substantive kick-out rights have been granted to the noncontrolling interests. In addition, we consolidate a legal entity deemed to be a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) when we determine that we are the VIE's primary beneficiary. All material inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n \u2022 In September 2016 we unwound our joint venture interest in a RIDEA that we accounted for under the equity method. Subsequent periods show no corresponding entry for the attribution of $1,176,000 to the minority interest. \nOur FFO per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $(0.14) (2.5%) over the same period in 2017. Our normalized FFO for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $0.17 (3.2%) over the same period in 2017, primarily as the result of our new real estate investments in 2017 and 2018. FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) and applied by us, is net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment, if applicable, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, if any. The Company's computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from that of the Company; therefore, caution should be exercised when comparing our Company's FFO to that of other REITs. Diluted FFO assumes the exercise of stock options and other potentially dilutive securities. Normalized FFO excludes from FFO certain items which may create some difficulty in comparing FFO for the current period to similar prior periods, and may include, but are not limited to, impairment of non-real estate assets, gains and losses attributable to the acquisition and disposition of assets and liabilities, recoveries of previous write-downs and the write off of debt issuance costs due to credit facility modifications.\n \u2022 Depreciation expense increased $7,648,000 primarily due to new real estate investments completed during 2017 and 2016. \nAt December 31, 2018, our ALF construction loans to Bickford are summarized as follows:\n \u2022 Interest expense, including amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, increased $2,731,000 primarily as a result of an increase in 30-day LIBOR, which is the benchmark for our revolving debt. \nOur dividends per share for the last three years are as follows:\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nPotential Effects of Medicare Reimbursement\nWe adjust rental income for the amortization of payments recorded as the result of the eventual settlement of commitments and contingencies listed later in Item 7 as lease inducements. Amortization of these payments against revenues was $387,000, $119,000 and $40,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe conversion feature is generally available to the noteholders entering the last six months of the notes' term but may also become actionable if the market price of NHI's common stock should, for 20 of 30 consecutive trading days within a calendar quarter, sustain a level in excess of 130% of the adjusted conversion price, or $90.44 per share, down from $93.55 per share, initially. The notes are optional net-share settlement\u201d instruments, meaning that NHI has the ability and intent to settle the principal amount of the indebtedness in cash, with possible dilutive share issuances for any excess, at NHI's option. Settlement of the notes requires management to allocate the consideration we ultimately pay between the debt component and the equity conversion\nInvestment Highlights\nInvesting Activities - Net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased primarily due to $254,636,000 of investments in real estate and notes, which were partially offset by collection of notes receivable. Net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased primarily due to $225,646,000 of investments in real estate and notes, which were partially offset by collection of notes receivable, sales of marketable securities and certain real estate assets, compared with $486,788,000 of investments in real estate and notes in 2016 that were similarly offset by collections.\nLife Care Services\nReal Estate Properties\nTenant Non-Compliance\nWe are evaluating and will likely make real estate and note investments in 2019 while we continue to monitor and improve our existing properties. We seek tenants who will become mission-oriented partners in relationships where our business goals are aligned. This approach aims to fuel steady, and thus, enduring growth for those partners and for NHI. Within the context of our growth model, we rely on a cost-effective access to debt and equity capital to finance acquisitions that will drive our earnings. There is significant competition for healthcare assets from other REITs, both public and private, and from private equity sources. Large-scale portfolios continue to command premium pricing, due to the continued abundance of private and foreign buyers seeking to invest in healthcare real estate. This combination of circumstances places a premium on our ability to execute acquisitions and negotiate leases that will generate meaningful earnings growth for our shareholders. We emphasize growth with our existing tenants and borrowers as a way to insulate us from other competition.\n 2. the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. \nWe currently estimate that our borrowers and lessees will find these Medicare increases to be adequate in the near term due to their credit quality, profitability and their debt or lease coverage ratios, although no assurances can be given as to what the ultimate effect that PDPM increases on an annual basis will have on each of our borrowers and lessees. According to industry studies, state Medicaid funding is not expected to keep pace with inflation. Any future acquisitions by NHI of skilled nursing facilities are planned on a selective basis, with emphasis on operator quality and newer construction.\nHoliday\nThe significant items affecting revenues and expenses are described below (in thousands):\nadditional funding of up to $1,900,000 in capital improvements, and the lease provides for incentives of $5,000,000 to become available beginning in 2020 upon the attainment of certain operating metrics. NHI will have a right of first offer on two additional Wingate-operated facilities. We accounted for the transaction as an asset purchase.\nLiquidity\nMost of our existing leases contain annual escalators in rent payments. For financial statement purposes, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain of our operators hold purchase options allowing them to acquire properties they currently lease from NHI. For options open or coming open in the short term, we are engaged in negotiations to continue as lessor or in some other capacity.\nFFO and normalized FFO are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative, and should be supplemented with a measure such as FFO. The term FFO was designed by the REIT industry to address this issue.\nOur normalized FAD for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $16,395,000 (8.3%) over the same period in 2017 due primarily to the impact of real estate investments completed during 2017 and 2018. In addition to the adjustments included in the calculation of normalized AFFO, normalized FAD excludes the impact of non-cash stock based compensation. Normalized FAD is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT as a useful indicator of the ability to distribute dividends to shareholders. Additionally, normalized FAD improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with: (i) expected results, (ii) results of previous periods and (iii) results among REITs, more meaningful. Because FAD may function as a liquidity measure, we do not present FAD on a per-share basis.\nWe calculate our fixed charge coverage ratio as approximately 6.0x for the year ended December 31, 2018 (see our discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to our net income on page 52). Giving effect to our acquisitions and financings on an annualized basis, our consolidated net debt-to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is approximately 4.5x for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nOf our total revenues, $43,311,000 (15%), $43,817,000 (16%) and $43,817,000 (18%) were derived from Holiday for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, including $5,616,000, $7,397,000 and $8,965,000 in straight-line rent, respectively. Our tenant operates the facilities pursuant to a management agreement with a Holiday-affiliated manager.\nOn June 15, 2018, East Lake Capital Management LLC and certain related entities, including Regency, filed suit against NHI and NHI-REIT of Axel, LLC, in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas; 95th Judicial District for injunctive and declaratory relief and unspecified monetary damages, including attorney's fees. The suit sought, among other things, to enjoin NHI from making certain references to East Lake in NHI's public filings. In response to this lawsuit, related litigation, and other circumstances, we entered motions calling for the immediate appointment of a receiver and for pre-judgment possession, hearing, and bond.\nOperating Activities - Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 increased primarily as a result of the collection of lease and interest payments on new real estate and note investments completed during 2018 and 2017.\nThe following tables summarize information as of December 31, 2018 related to our outstanding commitments and contingencies which are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nPrior Year\n 1. the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and \nOther\nThe credit facility agreement requires that we calculate specified financial statement metrics and meet or exceed a variety of financial ratios, which are usual and customary in nature. These ratios are calculated quarterly and have been within required limits. The calculation of our leverage ratio involves intermediate determinations of our total indebtedness\u201d and of our total asset value,\u201d as defined. We are near the upper bounds delineated by Level 2 in the Interest Rate Schedule, above.\nIn other financing transactions during the year ended December 31, 2018, we undertook targeted open-market repurchases of certain of our convertible notes. Settlement of the notes requires management to allocate the consideration we ultimately pay between the debt component and the equity conversion feature as though they were separate instruments. The allocation is effected by fair valuing the debt component first, with any remainder allocated to the conversion feature. Amounts expended to settle the notes are recognized first as a settlement of the notes at our carrying value and then are recognized in income to the extent the portion allocated to the debt instrument differs from carrying value. The remainder of the allocation, if any, is treated as settlement of equity and adjusted through our capital in excess of par account.\nComfort Care\n\nFinancial highlights of the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016 were as follows:\n\nFor a discussion of incentive loan draws of $8,000,000 available to Bickford related to borrowings for the development of its properties in Illinois, Michigan, and Virginia, see page 34 of Investment Highlights.\nAs of December 31, 2018 our Bickford lease portfolio is structured as follows (in thousands):\nNormalized AFFO is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT. GAAP requires a lessor to recognize contractual lease payments into income on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease. This straight-line adjustment has the effect of reporting lease income that is significantly more or less than the contractual cash flows received pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement. GAAP also requires the original issue discount of our convertible senior notes and debt issuance costs to be amortized as non-cash adjustments to earnings. Normalized AFFO is useful to our investors as it reflects the growth inherent in the contractual lease payments of our real estate portfolio.\nFluctuations in portfolio coverage are a result of market and economic trends, local market competition, and regulatory factors as well as the operational success of our tenants. We use the results of individual leases to inform our decision making with respect to specific tenants, but trends described above by property type and operator bear analysis. Our Need-Driven SHO portfolio shows a decline brought about primarily by a softening in occupancy within particular markets, as well as rising wage pressures. For many of the affected operators, as is typical of our portfolio in general, NHI has significant security deposits in place and/or corporate guarantees should actual cash rental shortfalls eventually materialize. In certain instances, our operators may elect to increase their security deposits with us in an amount equal to the coverage shortfall, and, upon subsequent compliance with the required lease coverage ratio, the operator would then be entitled to a full refund. The metrics presented in the tables above give no effect to the presence of these security deposits. For Skilled Nursing, coverage in the All Other segment of our portfolio has improved due to a better operating environment for the segment, as a whole, and for the Ensign portfolio transition, in particular. Each MOB's coverage is driven by the underlying performance of its on-campus hospital as the tenant or guarantor under the lease. In Texas, the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 witnessed the shut-down of the guarantor hospital for a few days resulting in lost revenue, overtime and other one-time charges, negatively impacting the hospital's bottom-line and\nAt December 31, 2018, we had investments in real estate, mortgage and other notes receivable involving 232 facilities located in 33 states. These investments involve 151 senior housing properties, 76 skilled nursing facilities, 3 hospitals, 2 medical office buildings and other notes receivable. These investments (excluding our corporate office of $2,471,000) consisted of properties with an original cost of $2,815,894,000, rented under triple-net leases to 30 lessees, and $246,111,000 aggregate carrying value of mortgage and other notes receivable due from 10 borrowers.\nOur primary sources of cash include rent payments, principal and interest payments on mortgage and other notes receivable, interest and dividends received on our marketable securities, proceeds from the sales of real property, net proceeds from offerings of equity securities and borrowings from our term loans and revolving credit facility. Our primary uses of cash include debt service payments (both principal and interest), new investments in real estate and notes, dividend distributions to our shareholders and general corporate overhead.\nStraight-line rent of $5,436,000 and $6,984,000 was recognized from the Senior Living lease for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Straight-line rent of $5,028,000 and $5,102,000 was recognized from the Bickford leases for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Straight-line rent of $5,616,000 and $7,397,000 was recognized from the Holiday lease for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In November 2018, we announced an agreement with Holiday to receive approximately $65,762,000 in specified cash and other consideration in exchange for a reduced annual rental payment for the existing 25 properties, beginning at $31,500,000 for 2019, as discussed below under the heading Other Portfolio Activity. For NHC, rent escalations are based on a percentage increase in revenue over a base year and do not give rise to non-cash, straight-line rental income.\nOf our total revenues, $5,540,000 (2%), $6,141,000 (2%), and $1,957,000 (1%) in lease revenues were derived from the above tenants for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOn January 1, 2018 we adopted ASU 2017-12 Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, as discussed in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. The transition method is a modified retrospective approach that required the Company to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of 2018. The primary provision in the ASU requiring adjustment to our beginning retained earnings is the change in timing and income statement line item for ineffectiveness related to cash flow hedges. Upon the adoption of the new standard, we reversed cumulative ineffectiveness occurring in the last six months of 2017, resulting in a retroactive net charge to retained earnings and a credit to accumulated other comprehensive income of $235,000 as of January 1, 2018. Upon adoption of the ASU, the Company achieved a better alignment of its financial reporting for hedging activities with the economic objectives of those activities.\nWe currently have no outstanding guarantees. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, our leases, mortgages and other notes receivable with certain entities represent variable interests in those enterprises. However, because we do not control these entities, nor do we have any role in their day-to-day management, we are not their primary beneficiary. Except as discussed below under Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities, we have no further material obligations arising from our transactions with these entities, and we believe our maximum exposure to loss at December 31, 2018, due to this involvement would be limited to our contractual commitments and contingent liabilities and the amount of our current investments with them, as detailed further in in Notes 1, 2, 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements.\n1 NHC based on corporate-level fixed-charge coverage and includes 3 independent living facilities\nOn January 15, 2019, we acquired a 267-unit senior living campus in Massachusetts for a purchase price of $50,300,000, including closing costs of $300,000. The facility is being leased to Wingate Healthcare, Inc. ( Wingate\u201d) for a term of 10 years, with three five-year renewal options, at an initial lease rate of 7.5% plus annual fixed escalators. We have committed to the\nAnother of our tenants, The LaSalle Group, with five buildings in Illinois and Texas, is in material non-compliance with provisions of our lease regarding mandated coverage ratios, working capital requirements and timeliness of rent payments. Lease revenues from the tenant have comprised less than 2% of our rental income, and the tenant is two months in arrears on its rent payments to us as of December 31, 2018. As of October 31, 2018, we wrote off the accumulated straight-line rent receivable of $1,496,000, we ceased recording straight-line rent income, and we adopted the cash basis for recognition of revenues from this tenant. We have made no rent concessions to the tenant as of December 31, 2018, and we are pursuing our remedies to the full extent of our agreements. The tenant has requested forbearance, though no assurance can be given as of the date of this filing that an effective forbearance agreement can be reached.\nAdditional disclosure requirements also give widely ranging results depending on market price variability. The notes will be freely convertible in the last six months of their contractual life, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020; however, generally accepted accounting principles require us to periodically report the amount by which the notes' convertible value exceeds their principal amount, without regard to the current availability of the conversion feature. Further, the mechanics of the calculation require the use of an end-of-period stock price, so that using that amount for the remaining notes outstanding of $120,000,000 at December 31, 2018, delivers an excess of $10,697,000, whereas the use of another price point would give a different result.\nAffiliates of East Lake\nFFO, AFFO & FAD\nOur bank credit facility derives from agreements entered into in August 2017 and September 2018. Together these agreements establish our unsecured $1,100,000,000 bank credit facility, which consists of $250,000,000 and $300,000,000 term loans and a $550,000,000 revolving credit facility. The $250,000,000 term loan and $550,000,000 revolving facility mature in August 2022, and the $300,000,000 term loan matures in September 2023. With the 2018 Agreement, we converted $300,000,000 of debt initially drawn on our revolving facility into a five-year term loan.\nThe construction loans are secured by first mortgage liens on substantially all real and personal property as well as a pledge of any and all leases or agreements which may grant a right of use to the subject property. Usual and customary covenants extend to the agreements, including the borrower's obligation for payment of insurance and taxes. NHI has a purchase option on the properties at stabilization, whereby the lease rate will be set with a floor of 9.55%, based on NHI's total investment, plus fixed\nfeature as though they were separate instruments. The allocation is effected by valuing the debt component first, with any remainder allocated to the conversion feature. Amounts expended to settle the notes will be recognized first as a settlement of the notes at par and then will be recognized in income to the extent the portion allocated to the debt instrument differs from par value. The remainder of the allocation, if any, will be treated as settlement of equity and adjusted through our paid in capital account.\nOn December 21, 2018 we entered into an agreement to lend LCS-Westminster Partnership IV LLP ( Life Care Services IV\u201d), an affiliate of Life Care Services, the manager of the facility, up to $180,000,000. The loan agreement conveys a mortgage interest and will facilitate the construction of Phase II of Sagewood, a Type-A Continuing Care Retirement Community in Scottsdale, AZ.\n \u2022 Loan and realty losses of $15,856,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 relate to non-cash transactional write-offs involving the acquisition of eight skilled nursing facilities from Legend and transition of a total of 15 SNF leases to Ensign in the second quarter of 2016, and the non-cash write-off of straight-line rent receivable during the third quarter of 2016 resulting from a tenant's material non-compliance with our lease terms which, as of October 1, 2017, NHI has transitioned to another tenant. \nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nLitigation\nThe long-term health care industry has experienced significant professional liability claims which have resulted in an increase in the cost of insurance to cover potential claims. In previous years, these factors have combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings, bankruptcy court rulings and court judgments affecting our lessees and borrowers. In prior years, we have determined that impairment of certain of our loan investments had occurred as a result of these events.\nThe original libel action of the East Lake affiliated entities survives the Rule 11 agreement and is set to continue in January 2019. NHI is not precluded from further action in damages under terms of the lease.\nEnsign\nThe following tables summarize our investments in real estate and mortgage and other notes receivable as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nThe table above does not include indirect legal and accounting costs of $263,000 for 2017 and $217,000 for 2018 associated with updating and maintaining our shelf registration statement.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 27% of our revenue was derived from operators of our skilled nursing facilities that receive a significant portion of their revenue from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. Such revenues are subject annually to statutory and regulatory changes and in recent years have been reduced due to federal and state budgetary pressures. Over the past five years, we have selectively diversified our portfolio by directing a significant portion of our investments into properties which do not rely primarily on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, but rather on private pay sources (assisted living and memory care facilities, senior living campuses, independent living facilities and entrance-fee communities). We will occasionally acquire skilled nursing facilities in good physical condition with a proven operator and strong local market fundamentals, because diversification implies a periodic rebalancing, but our recent investment focus has been on acquiring need-driven and discretionary senior housing assets.\nIt is possible that consolidation will also result from our interactions and negotiations with any of the operators of the other properties discussed above, however, the nature and form of any agreements that will result from this process are unknown at this time.\n1 Interest is calculated based on the weighted average interest rate of outstanding debt balances as of December 31, 2018. The calculation also includes a commitment fee of.20%.\nWhen present, tenant purchase options generally give the lessee an option to purchase the underlying property for consideration determined by i) a sliding base dependent upon the extent of appreciation in the property plus a specified proportion of any appreciation; ii) our acquisition costs plus a specified proportion of any appreciation; iii) an agreed capitalization rate applied to the current rental; or iv) our acquisition costs plus a profit floor plus a specified proportion of any appreciation.\nFor operations which we place in our Taxable REIT Subsidiary ( TRS\u201d), we have NOL carryforwards of $462,000 available to offset taxable income in the TRS. The carry-forwards expire beginning in 2028.\nAccording to the Administration on Aging ( AoA\u201d) of the US Department of Health and Human Services, in 2016, the latest year for which data is available, 49.2 million people were age 65 or older in the United States (a 33% increase over the last ten years). Census estimates showed that, by 2040, those 65 or older are expected to constitute 21.7% of the population. The population aged 85 and above is projected to rise from 6.4 million in 2016 to 14.6 million in the US by 2040 (a 129% increase).\n \u2022 NHI and Holiday are reviewing the portfolio to identify underperforming properties within the existing Holiday lease. A subsequent sale of properties, if any, would reduce the rent owed us by 7.0% of the net proceeds received by NHI. Stated levels of our security deposit and tenant Credit Enhancement will not be adjusted as a result of any future sale. \nUtilization of Tenant Escrow Deposits\nWe intend to comply with REIT dividend requirements that we distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2018 and thereafter. Dividends declared for the fourth quarter of each fiscal year are paid by the end of the following January and are, with some exceptions, treated for tax purposes as having been paid in the fiscal year just ended as provided in IRS Code Sec. 857(b)(8). We declare special dividends when we compute our REIT taxable income in an amount that exceeds our regular dividends for the fiscal year.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values of our properties on a property-by-property basis. On a quarterly basis, we review our properties for recoverability when events or circumstances, including significant physical changes in the property, significant adverse changes in general economic conditions and significant deteriorations of the underlying cash flows of the property, indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable. The need to recognize an impairment charge is based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of that property. If recognition of an impairment charge is necessary, it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the fair value of the property.\nThe results by asset type are presented below on a trailing twelve-month basis, as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 (the most recent periods available):\n \u2022 Investment and other gains for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $10,038,000 from the sale of marketable securities. \nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with REIT requirements. Our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. We believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will be able to so qualify at all times. Until September 30, 2016, we operated a taxable REIT subsidiary under a joint venture structured to comply with the provisions of the RIDEA through which we invested in facility operations managed by independent third-parties. On September 30, 2016, NHI and Bickford entered into a definitive agreement terminating the joint venture. In the past we recorded income tax expense or benefit with respect to the subsidiary which was taxed under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations. Aside from such income taxes that may have been applicable to the taxable income in our taxable REIT subsidiary, we are not subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that we continue to qualify as a REIT and make distributions to stockholders equal to or in excess of our taxable income. This treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation\u201d (at the corporate and stockholder levels) that typically applies to corporate dividends. Our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable REIT qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n \u2022 Payroll and related compensation expenses increased $2,080,000 due primarily to the addition of new corporate employees and the expense of certain incentive bonuses. \nResulting from these claims and counterclaims, on December 6, 2018, the plaintiff parties entered into an agreement with NHI under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which rule ensures the enforceability of an agreement between lawyers in a case when the agreement is in writing and filed in the papers of the court. The agreement provided that Regency vacate our facilities in Indiana and North Carolina on December 7, 2018 and in Tennessee on December 14, 2018. Further, Regency agreed to provide minimal levels of cooperation in transitioning the facilities.\nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) guidance for our arrangements with VIEs which requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. We may change our assessment of a VIE due to events such as modifications of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity's equity investments at risk and the disposal of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary.\nWe began liquidating our position in LTC Properties, Inc. ( LTC\u201d) common stock in the fourth quarter of 2015. We realized taxable gains of $10,038,000 and $29,673,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nREIT Qualification\n\nThe following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of National Health Investors, Inc. for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other important factors are identified in Item 1. Business\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d above.\n \u2022 Investment and other gains for the year ended December 31, 2017 consist of $10,038,000 from the sale of marketable securities. For the year ended December 31, 2016, investment and other gains include $29,673,000 from the sale of marketable securities, $2,805,000 from the sale of two Texas skilled nursing facilities, $1,654,000 from the sale of an Idaho skilled nursing facility, $123,000 from the sale of a vacant land parcel in Alabama and $1,657,000 recorded as a gain on the sale of our 85% non-controlling interest in OpCo. \nFor instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative has been reported as a component of other comprehensive income ( OCI\u201d), and reclassified into earnings in the same period, or periods, during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness have been recognized in earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness related to our cash flow hedges, which is reported in current period earnings as interest expense, was not significant in 2016. With the amendment of our bank credit facility in August 2017, discussed above, the introduction to the debt instrument of a LIBOR floor not present in the hedges resulted in hedge inefficiency of approximately $353,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, which we credited to interest expense.\nWe may continue from time to time to seek to retire or purchase some of our outstanding convertible notes through cash open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. As with our 2018 repurchases, amounts and timing of further repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be dependent on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nThese sources and uses of cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as summarized below (dollars in thousands):\nWe will amortize to income the net proceeds received from Holiday under the Agreement so that cash or other consideration received in 2019 will be adjusted to deferred revenue/expense, resulting in the recognition of annual revenues from this lease through 2035 of $37,748,000 on a straight-line basis. From 2019 through June 2022 we will include the deferred revenue balance of the straight-line payable for this lease among other liabilities on our balance sheet. After June 2022, cumulative straight-line amortization of the deferred revenue/expense associated with the Holiday lease will result in the more typical asset balance.\nOur tenants and borrowers who operate SNFs derive their revenues primarily from Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs. Amounts paid under these government programs are subject to legislative and government budget constraints. From time to time, there may be material changes in government reimbursement. In the past, SNFs have experienced material reductions in government reimbursement.\nresultant coverage ratios for that MOB. Within the context of this event-specific occurrence, it is also typical of MOB operations that there may be other large fluctuations in coverage resulting from hospital operations.\nWhen we take on new debt or when we modify or replace existing debt, we incur debt issuance costs. These costs are subject to amortization over the term of the new debt instrument and may result in the write-off of fees associated with debt which has been replaced or modified. Sustaining long-term dividend growth will require that we consider all sources of capital mentioned above, with the goal of maintaining a low-leverage balance sheet as mitigation against potential adverse changes in the business of our industry, tenants and borrowers.\nannual escalators. On these and future loan development projects, Bickford as the borrower is entitled to up to $2,000,000 per project in incentive loan draws based upon the achievement of predetermined operational milestones, the funding of which will increase the principal amount, NHI's future purchase price under option and, upon exercise, eventual lease payment to NHI.\nIn October 2017, we issued a letter of forbearance to one of our tenants for a default on our lease terms involving coverage and liquidity ratios. Rent payments to NHI are current as of December 31, 2018. Lease revenues from the tenant and its affiliates comprise 3% of our rental income, and the related straight-line rent receivable was approximately $4,566,000 at December 31, 2018. NHI's ongoing monitoring from 2017 through 2018 indicated that the tenant's operations and financial position have continued to improve, and in February 2019 we released them from provisions of the forbearance letter.\nFor all periods presented, EBITDA reflects GAAP interest expense, which excludes amounts capitalized during the period.\n\nNational Health Investors, Inc., established in 1991 as a Maryland corporation, is a self-managed REIT specializing in sale-leaseback, joint-venture, mortgage and mezzanine financing of need-driven and discretionary senior housing and medical investments. Our portfolio consists of lease, mortgage and other note investments in independent living facilities, assisted living facilities, entrance-fee communities, senior living campuses, skilled nursing facilities, specialty hospitals and medical office buildings. Other investments have included marketable securities and, until 2016, a joint venture structured to comply with the provisions of the REIT Investment Diversification Empowerment Act of 2007 ( RIDEA\u201d) through which we invested in facility operations managed by an independent third-party. We have funded our real estate investments primarily through: (1) operating cash flow, (2) debt offerings, including bank lines of credit and term debt, both unsecured and secured, and (3) the sale of equity securities.\ninterest is not probable of collection until received, our policy is to recognize rental or interest income when assured, which we consider to be the period in which cash is received or accrued on the basis of tenant security deposits available to us for the recognition of lease revenue in the period in which it was earned. We identify investments as nonperforming if a required payment is not received within 30 days of the date it is due. This policy could cause our revenues to vary significantly from period to period. Rental income from minimum lease payments under our leases is recognized on a straight-line basis to the extent that future lease payments are considered collectible. Lease payments that depend on a factor directly related to future use of the property, such as an increase in annual revenues over base year revenues, are considered to be contingent rentals and are included in rental income when they are determinable and earned.\nWe believe that the current carrying amounts of our real estate properties are recoverable and that mortgage notes receivable are realizable and supported by the value of the underlying collateral. However, it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments to these carrying amounts.\nOn April 30, 2018, we acquired an assisted living/memory-care portfolio in Ohio and Pennsylvania totaling 320 units and comprising five facilities, one of which is subject to a ground lease with remaining term, including extensions, of 50 years. The purchase price was $69,750,000, inclusive of $500,000 in closing costs and $1,750,000 in specified capital improvements, which will be added to the lease base upon funding. In addition to the cash consideration stated above, we recorded an intangible liability of $590,000 to recognize our above-market obligation for the ground lease. We included this portfolio in a separate master lease with Bickford which provides for a lease rate of 6.85%, with annual fixed escalators over a term of 15 years plus renewal options, subject to a fair market value rent reset feature available to NHI between years three and five.\nIn December 2018, we reached an agreement with Ignite Team Partners, LLC, d/b/a Ignite Medical Resorts, to develop a $25,350,000 skilled nursing facility in suburban Milwaukee. The facility is currently under construction with an expected opening date in the fourth quarter of 2019. The facility will be leased to Ignite Healthcare, Inc. ( Ignite\u201d) for a term of 12 years, with two ten-year renewal options, at an initial lease rate of 9.5% plus annual fixed escalators. Ignite will be eligible for an earn-out of up to $2,000,000, to be funded beginning in 2026 upon the attainment of specified metrics. NHI will have a right of first offer on future Ignite projects. We accounted for the transaction as an asset purchase. At December 31, 2018, we had funded $4,674,000, including $2,000,000 for the purchase of land.\nApart from operations, a primary source of our liquidity is our unsecured bank credit facility. At December 31, 2018, we had $466,000,000 available to draw on our revolving credit facility.\nNHI's at-the-market ( ATM\u201d) offerings were initially made pursuant to a prospectus dated March 18, 2014, and a related prospectus supplement dated February 17, 2015, which constitute a part of our effective shelf registration statement that was previously filed with the SEC. We filed a new registration statement and commenced a new ATM program effective February 22, 2017. The following table summarizes the issuances since inception on our ATM as of December 31, 2018:\n24 months and selected immaterial properties identified in 2019 as available for sale.For stabilized acquisitions in the portfolio less than 24 months and renewing leases with changes in scheduled rent, we include pro forma cash rent. For this reporting period, we have excluded results from SH Regency Leasing, LLC, as noted below under the heading Other Portfolio Activity.\nOn January 12, 2018, NHI acquired from a developer a 121-bed skilled nursing facility in Waxahachie, Texas for a cash investment of $14,404,000, and in May, we acquired from another developer two 132-bed skilled nursing facilities in Garland and Fort Worth, Texas, for a cash investment totaling $29,000,000. Additional consideration of $1,275,000 for the Waxahachie property and $1,250,000 for each of Garland and Ft. Worth were contributed by the lessee, The Ensign Group ( Ensign\u201d). We have capitalized the tenant contributions as a component of the cost of the facilities and have recorded the contributions as deferred revenue, which we are amortizing to revenue over the term of the master lease to which these properties have now been added. The remaining term of the master lease extends through April 2031, plus renewal options. The blended initial lease rate is set at 8.1%, subject to annual escalators based on prevailing inflation rates. The acquisitions were accounted for as asset purchases and fulfill our original commitment to acquire and lease to Ensign four skilled nursing facilities in New Braunfels, Waxahachie, Garland and Fort Worth, Texas.\n \u2022 Depreciation expense increased $4,176,000 primarily due to new real estate investments completed during 2018 and 2017. \n\n \u2022 Effective January 1, 2019, Holiday rent was reset to $31,500,000 for the existing 25 properties, as opposed to the $39,000,000 previously obligated, with escalators commencing annually November 1, 2020, equal to the greater of 2.0% or 45% of trailing 12 months year-over-year revenue growth of the NHI/Holiday portfolio, not to exceed 3.0%. \n \u2022 We have committed to invest up to $5,000,000 in capital expenditures into the communities at a 7.0% lease rate on funds drawn. In addition, Holiday has committed to a minimum of $1,500 per unit in annual capital expenditures. \n\nWe consider an accounting estimate or assumption critical if:\n\nOur operators report to us the results of their operations on a periodic basis, which we in turn subject to further analysis as a means of monitoring potential concerns within our portfolio. We have identified EBITDARM (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees) as the most elemental barometer of success for our tenants, based on results they have reported to us. We believe EBITDARM is useful in our most fundamental analyses, as it is a property level measure of our operators' success, by eliminating the effects of the operator's method of acquiring the use of its assets (interest and rent), its non-cash expenses (depreciation and amortization), expenses that are dependent on its level of success (income taxes), and also excluding the effect of the operator's payment of its management fees, as typically those fees are contractually subordinate to our lease payment. For operators of our entrance-fee communities, our calculation of EBITDARM includes other cash flow adjustments typical of the industry which may include, but are not limited to, net cash flows from entrance fees; amortization of deferred entrance fees; adjustments for tenant rent obligations, depreciation and amortization; and management fee true-ups. The eliminations and adjustments reflect covenants in our leases and provide a comparable basis for assessing our various relationships\nAs of December 31, 2018, we leased 25 independent living facilities to an affiliate of Holiday Retirement ( Holiday\u201d) at an original cost of $493,000,000. The 17-year master lease began in December 2013 and provides for a minimum annual escalator of 3.5% after 2017.\nIn November 2018, we entered into a lease amendment and guaranty release ( the Agreement\u201d) with Holiday. The Agreement extends the term of the lease, increases required minimum capital expenditure per unit and provides NHI with stronger projected 2019 lease coverage ratio. Below is a summary of the provisions of the new agreement:\nOther Lease Portfolio Activity\nAs of December 31, 2018, our contractual payment obligations were as follows (in thousands):\n\nContractual Obligations\nInterest Rate Schedule\n \u2022 Loan and realty losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulted primarily from $4,752,000 of straight-line rent receivable write-downs including $1,436,000 related to a Wisconsin property, $1,820,000 from our SH Regency portfolio and $1,496,000 from a Midwest portfolio, as well as a $363,000 write-down of a note receivable. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n \u2022 The agreement provided that, in lieu of cash mentioned above, we could have sole discretion to acquire a Holiday property that will be leased back to Holiday at an agreed-upon rent and subject to the same terms and conditions of the amended master lease. On January 31, 2019, we acquired a senior housing facility in Vero Beach, Florida as discussed in Note 15. \nAs of December 31, 2018, based on our assessment of likely undiscounted cash flows we determined no impairment charge was required on the land, building and improvements formerly leased to Regency. We wrote off straight-line receivables from the Regency properties totaling $1,820,000 during the fourth quarter of 2018 and included this amount in loan and realty losses in our consolidated statement of income.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations - AFFO\nTotal expenditures of $29,985,000 include paid amounts of $27,558,000 allocated to the note retirement with the remaining expenditure of $2,427,000 allocated to capital in excess of par. A loss of $738,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, resulted from the excess of cash expenditures over the book value of the notes retired, net of discount and issuance costs.\n\nOf our total revenues, $5,103,000 (2%), $5,466,000 (2%), and $5,444,000 (2%) in lease revenues were derived from Regency for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWe manage our business with a goal of increasing the regular annual dividends paid to shareholders. Our Board of Directors approves a regular quarterly dividend which is reflective of expected taxable income on a recurring basis. Our transactions that are infrequent and non-recurring that generate additional taxable income have been distributed to shareholders in the form of special dividends. Taxable income is determined in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and differs from net income for\nThe revolving facility fee is currently 20 basis points per annum, and floating interest on the revolver and term loans are presently set at 30-day LIBOR (252 bps at December 31, 2018) plus 115 and a blended 127 basis points, respectively. Within the facility, the employment of interest rate swaps for our fixed term debt leaves only our revolving credit facility and newly issued term loan of $300,000,000 exposed to interest rate risk through April 2019, when our $40,000,000 swap expires. Our swaps and the financial instruments to which they relate are described later in this section. The current interest spreads and facility fee reflect our leverage-ratio compliance based on the applicable margin for LIBOR loans, measuring debt to Total Asset Value,\u201d at Level 2 in the Interest Rate Schedule provided below in abridged format:\nFinancing Activities - The use of cash in financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 resulted primarily from the excess of dividend payments over proceeds from equity offerings, the impact of other large transactions primarily being the restructuring of our debt.\n\nBased on our assessment of current operations and the availability of suitable operating partners, we may seek new tenants or managers for the other properties mentioned above. If we enter into a management agreement rather than a lease as we seek to stabilize the operations of these facilities and if our resulting operating partner does not have adequate liquidity to accept the risks and rewards of ownership, NHI might be deemed the primary beneficiary of the operations and might be required to consolidate those statements of financial position and results of operations of the managers or operating partners into our consolidated financial statements.\nA roll-forward of our convertible note balances, including the effect of year-to-date amortization, net of issuance costs, is presented below:\nWingate\nContingent lease inducement payments of $10,000,000 related to the five Bickford development properties constructed in 2016 and 2017 include a licensure incentive of $250,000 per property and a three-tiered operator incentive schedule paying up to an additional $1,750,000, based on the attainment of certain performance metrics. Upon funding, these payments are added to the lease base and amortized against rental income.\nThe significant items affecting revenues and expenses are described below (in thousands):\nThe determination of fair value and whether a shortfall in operating revenues or the existence of operating losses is indicative of a loss in value that is other than temporary involves significant judgment. Our estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and trends, the duration of the fair value deficiency, and any other relevant factors. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.\n \u2022 The lease maturity is extended by five years to December 31, 2035, and will be secured by the remaining half of the NHI-held security deposit. Additionally, NHI is requiring $5,000,000 of equity to be contributed by the parent into the Holiday tenant entity ( the Credit Enhancement\u201d). The use of the Credit Enhancement will be limited to payment of NHI rent and NHI-approved capital expenditures. Future return of the Credit Enhancement will further be limited by performance measures, including liquidity and lease service coverage ratio covenants. The Agreement also requires that $6,500,000 of equity be contributed to the Holiday management company. \nOur borrowers and tenants experience periods of significant financial pressures and difficulties similar to those encountered by other health care providers. Governments at both the federal and state levels have enacted legislation to lower, or at least slow, the growth in payments to health care providers. Furthermore, the cost of professional liability insurance has increased significantly during this same period. Since our inception in 1991, a number of our facility operators and mortgage loan borrowers have undergone bankruptcy. Others have been forced to surrender properties to us in lieu of foreclosure or, for certain periods, have failed to make timely payments on their obligations to us.\nWe expect that borrowings on our revolving credit facility, borrowings on term loans, and our ATM program will allow us to continue to make real estate investments during 2019. However, we anticipate that our historically low cost of debt capital will continue to rise in the near to mid-term, as the federal government prolongs the upward transitioning of the federal funds rate. In response to the changed interest-rate environment, we may find it advisable within the coming year to acquire a public credit rating as a tool for managing our interest costs.\n \u2022 Interest expense, including amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, increased $3,216,000 primarily as a result of an increase in 30-day LIBOR, which is the benchmark for our revolving debt, and the refinancing of $75,000,000 in September 2016 to an 8-year note with annual interest at 3.93%. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n \u2022 Rental income, before straight-line adjustments, increased $18,947,000, or 7.9%, primarily as a result of new investments and lease escalators in our existing portfolio. Generally, future increases in rental income depend on our ability to make new investments which meet our underwriting criteria. \nWe collect rent and interest from our tenants and borrowers. Generally, our policy is to recognize income on an accrual basis as earned. However, when we determine, based on current collections and the lack of expected future collections, that rent or\nFollowing three 25 basis-point increases in 2017, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve announced four further increases during 2018. As inflation is expected to rise, officials have forecast a total of two increases in 2019. However, the actual path the federal funds rate takes will depend on the changing economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The anticipation of past and further increases in the federal funds rate in 2018 and beyond has been a primary source of much volatility in REIT equity markets. As a result, there will be pressure on the spread between our cost of capital and the returns we earn. We expect that pressure to be partially mitigated by market forces that would tend to result in higher capitalization rates for healthcare assets and higher lease rates indicative of historical levels. Our cost of capital has increased over the past year as we transition some of our short term revolving borrowings into debt instruments with longer maturities and fixed interest rates. Managing long-term risk involves trade-offs with the competing alternative goal of maximizing short-term profitability. Our intention is to strike an appropriate balance between these competing interests within the context of our investor profile. As interest rates rise, our share price may decline as investors adjust prices to reflect a dividend yield that is sufficiently in excess of a risk-free rate.\nBeyond the applicable ratios detailed above, increasing levels of leverage (not shown) will subject our debt to defined increases in interest rates and fees.\nWe anticipate continued use of proceeds from the ATM program for general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions and repayment of indebtedness, including borrowings under our credit facility. Acquisitions, if any, whose magnitude would entail an equity match unable to be efficiently sourced through the ATM would likely trigger a prospectus supplement and an underwritten or overnight offering of NHI common stock, rather than placement through the ATM.\n \u2022 We are to receive consideration of approximately $65,762,000 consisting of a combination of cash and real estate equaling $55,125,000 and the forfeiture to us of $10,637,000 which is one-half of the original $21,275,000 security deposit. \nFunds Available for Distribution - FAD\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we have four lessees (including their affiliated entities, which are the legal tenants) from whom we individually derive at least 10% of our rental income as follows (dollars in thousands):\nOur SNF operators receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare (federal) and Medicaid (states). Changes in reimbursement rates and limits on the scope of services reimbursed to skilled nursing facilities could have a material impact on the operators' liquidity and financial condition. On August 1, 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) announced the CMS Skilled Nursing Prospective Payment System ( PPS\u201d) final rule whereby, effective October 1, 2019, its Patient-Driven Payment Model ( PDPM\u201d) will replace Resource Utilization Groups ( RUGs\u201d)-IV. Facilities will have one year to transition to PDPM from RUGs-IV by the October 1, 2019 implementation date. PDPM is designed as a more simplified payment model than RUGs-IV and is projected to reduce administrative costs and foster innovation to improve care to patients. Regulators forecast a $2 billion reduction in provider costs over 10 years as a result of simplified paperwork requirements for resident assessments. The new model shifts care delivery under Medicare away from fee-for-service, which in the past has based reimbursement on the amount of care provided, to focus on value-based care, which will base reimbursement on clinical complexity and the resident's conditions and care needs. The final rule also established a 2.4% market basket increase beginning October 1, 2018.\nThese supplemental operating performance measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other REITs. Consequently, our Funds From Operations ( FFO\u201d), Normalized FFO, Normalized Adjusted Funds From Operations ( AFFO\u201d) and Normalized Funds Available for Distribution ( FAD\u201d) may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other REITs. Since other REITs may not use our definition of these operating performance measures, caution should be exercised when comparing our Company's FFO, Normalized FFO, Normalized AFFO and Normalized FAD to that of other REITs. These financial performance measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) (these measures do not include changes in operating assets and liabilities) and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance, or to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity, and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.\nFunds From Operations - FFO\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFor individual tenant revenue as a percentage of total lease revenue, Bickford is our largest assisted living tenant, an affiliate of Holiday is our largest independent living tenant, NHC is our largest skilled nursing tenant and Senior Living Communities is our largest entrance-fee community tenant. Our shift toward private payor facilities, as well as our expansion into the discretionary senior housing market, has further resulted in a portfolio whose current composition is relatively balanced between medical facilities, need-driven and discretionary senior housing.\nEquipped with the basics of financial security, many will be economically able to enter the market for senior housing. These strong demographic trends provide the context for continued growth in senior housing in 2019 and the years ahead. We plan to fund any new real estate and mortgage investments during 2019 using our liquid assets and debt financing. As the weight of additional debt resulting from new acquisitions suggests the need to rebalance our capital structure, we would then expect to access the capital markets through an at-the-market ( ATM\u201d) or other equity offering. Our disciplined investment strategy implemented through measured increments of debt and equity sets the stage for access to capital at the lowest possible rates, annual dividend growth, continued low leverage, a portfolio of diversified, high-quality assets, and business relationships with experienced operators whom we make our priority, continue to be the key drivers of our business plan.\nWe consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important supplemental measure because it provides information which we use to evaluate our performance and serves as an indication of our ability to service debt. We define Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including amounts in discontinued operations, excluding real estate asset impairments and gains on dispositions and certain items which may create some difficulty in comparing Adjusted EBITDA for the current period to similar prior periods, and may include, but are not limited to, impairment of non-real estate assets, gains and losses attributable to the acquisition and disposition of assets and liabilities, and recoveries of previous write-downs. Since others may not use our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, caution should be exercised when comparing our Adjusted EBITDA to that of other companies.\n\nEstimates\nBickford\nWe classify the properties in our portfolio as either senior housing or medical properties. We further classify our senior housing properties as either need-driven (assisted living facilities and senior living campuses) or discretionary (independent living facilities and entrance-fee communities). Medical properties within our portfolio include skilled nursing facilities, medical office buildings and specialty hospitals.\nThe following table reconciles net income attributable to common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP metric, to FFO, Normalized FFO, Normalized AFFO and Normalized FAD and is presented for both basic and diluted weighted average common shares (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nTraditionally, debt financing and cash resulting from operating and investing activities, which are derived from proceeds of lease and note collections, loan payoffs and the recovery of previous write-downs, have been used to satisfy our operational and investing needs and to provide a return to our shareholders. Those operational and investing needs reflect the resources necessary to maintain and cultivate our funding sources and have generally fallen into three categories: debt service, REIT operating expenses, and new real estate and note investments.\nOn June 15, 2018, East Lake Capital Management LLC and certain related entities, including Regency, filed suit against NHI and NHI-REIT of Axel, LLC, in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas; 95th Judicial District for injunctive and declaratory relief and unspecified monetary damages, including attorney's fees. The suit sought, among other things, to enjoin NHI from making certain references to East Lake in NHI's public filings. In response to this lawsuit, related litigation, and other circumstances, we entered motions calling for the immediate appointment of a receiver and for pre-judgment possession, hearing, and bond.\nCertain of our operators hold purchase options allowing them to acquire properties they currently lease from NHI. For options open or coming open in the near future, we are engaged in preliminary negotiations to continue as lessor or in some other capacity. A summary of these tenant options to purchase senior housing communities, hospitals, medical office buildings and skilled nursing facilities is presented below ($ in thousands):\nCommitments and Contingencies\nMajor Tenants\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our tenants who provided more than 3% of our total revenues were (parent company, in alphabetical order): Bickford Senior Living; Chancellor Health Care; The Ensign Group; Health Services Management; Holiday Retirement; National HealthCare Corporation; and Senior Living Communities.\nOur investments in healthcare real estate have been partially accomplished by our ability to effectively leverage our balance sheet. However, we continue to maintain a relatively low-leverage balance sheet compared with many in our peer group. We believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio, which is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including amounts in discontinued operations, excluding real estate asset impairments and gains on dispositions) to fixed charges (interest expense at contractual rates net of capitalized interest and principal payments on debt), and the ratio of consolidated net debt to Adjusted EBITDA are meaningful measures of our ability to service our debt. We use these two measures as a useful basis to compare the strength of our balance sheet with those in our peer group. We also believe this gives us a competitive advantage when accessing debt markets.\nFor our mortgage and other notes receivable, we evaluate the estimated collectibility of contractual loan payments and general economic conditions on an instrument-by-instrument basis. On a quarterly basis, we review our notes receivable for ability to realize on such notes when events or circumstances, including the non-receipt of contractual principal and interest payments, significant deteriorations of the financial condition of the borrower and significant adverse changes in general economic conditions, indicate that the carrying amount of the note receivable may not be recoverable. If necessary, impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value as measured by the discounted cash flows expected to be received under the note receivable or, if foreclosure is probable, the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable.\n\nThe loan takes the form of two notes under a master credit agreement. The senior note ( Note A\u201d) totals $118,800,000 at a 7.25% interest rate with 10 basis-point escalators after year three and has a term of 10 years. We have funded $76,653,000 of Note A as of December 31, 2018. Note A is interest-only and is locked to prepayment until January 2021. After 2020, the prepayment penalty starts at 2% and declines to 1% in 2022. The second note ( Note B\u201d) is a construction loan for up to $61,200,000 at an annual interest rate of 8.50% and carries a five-year maturity. We anticipate funding Note B through April 2020 and anticipate substantial repayment with new resident entrance fees upon the opening of Phase II. The total amount funded on Note B was $10,165,000 as of December 31, 2018.\nWith lower capitalization rates for existing healthcare facilities, there has been increased interest in constructing new facilities in hopes of generating better returns on invested capital. Using our relationship-driven model, we continue to look for opportunities to support new and existing tenants and borrowers with the capital needed to expand existing facilities and to initiate ground-up development of new facilities. We concentrate our efforts in those markets where there is both a demonstrated demand for a particular product type and where we perceive we have a competitive advantage. The projects we agree to finance have attractive upside potential and are expected to provide above-average returns to our shareholders to mitigate the risks inherent with property development and construction.\nOn September 30, 2016, NHI and Sycamore Street, LLC ( Sycamore\u201d), an affiliate of Bickford, entered into a definitive agreement terminating our joint venture which consisted of the ownership and operation of 40 properties and converting Bickford's participation to a triple-net tenancy with assumption of existing leases and terms. Through September 30, 2016, NHI owned an 85% equity interest and Sycamore owned a 15% equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary, PropCo which owned 40 assisted living/memory care facilities, three new facilities and two facilities in development. The facilities had been leased to OpCo, in which NHI previously held a non-controlling 85% ownership interest. The facilities are managed by Bickford. The joint venture was structured to comply with the provisions of RIDEA. For the combined transaction, we recognized a gain of $1,657,000 on the sale of OpCo; we recognized $462,000 of income tax expense in applying a full valuation allowance to our state net operating loss carry-forwards on our Taxable REIT Subsidiary; Bickford's non-controlling interest was de-recognized; and the difference between the fair value of NHI's cost allocated to the redemption and the carrying amount of the 15% non-controlling interest was recorded as an adjustment to equity through additional-paid-in capital.\nSources and Uses of Funds\nReal Estate and Mortgage Write-downs\nExecutive Overview\nOur leases are typically structured as triple net leases\u201d on single-tenant properties having an initial leasehold term of 10 to 15 years with one or more 5-year renewal options. As such, there may be reporting periods in which we experience few, if any, lease renewals or expirations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not have any renewing or expiring leases.\nFinancial highlights of the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017 were as follows:\nSince January 1, 2018, we have made or announced the following real estate and note investments ($ in thousands):\n\nVIE Considerations\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOn May 31, 2018, NHI acquired two assisted living facilities comprising a total of 106 units in Bridgeport and Saginaw, Michigan for a cash investment of $17,140,000, inclusive of $100,000 in closing costs. We leased the facilities to affiliates of Comfort Care Senior Living ( Comfort Care\u201d) at an initial lease rate of 7.25% with annual escalators adjusted for prevailing inflation rates, subject to a floor and ceiling of 2% and 3%, respectively. The lease provides for an initial six-month cash escrow. With the acquisition, NHI also obtained fair value-based purchase options for two newly constructed facilities operated by Comfort Care, with the purchase option windows to open upon stabilization. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, our average effective annualized rental income was $8,421 per bed for SNFs, $17,105 per unit for ALFs, $13,883 per unit for ILFs, $21,573 per unit for EFCs, $44,150 per bed for hospitals, and $8 per square foot for MOBs.\nThe use of funds from our ATM and the liquidation of our position in LTC common stock effected a rebalancing of our leverage in response to our acquisitions and has kept our options flexible for further expansion. We continue to explore various other funding sources including bank term loans, convertible debt, traditional equity placement, unsecured bonds and senior notes, debt private placement and secured government agency financing. We view our ATM program as an effective way to match-fund our smaller acquisitions by exercising control over the timing and size of transactions and achieving a more favorable cost of capital as compared to larger follow-on offerings.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWhile we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties are recoverable and our notes receivable and other investments are realizable, it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates.\nIn documents we have previously filed with and furnished to the SEC, we have used the shorthand East Lake\u201d to refer to the East Lake Capital Management affiliated entities for whom we have acted or continue to act as landlord. These entities consist of\nThe original libel action of the East Lake affiliated entities survives the Rule 11 agreement and is set to continue in February 2019.
