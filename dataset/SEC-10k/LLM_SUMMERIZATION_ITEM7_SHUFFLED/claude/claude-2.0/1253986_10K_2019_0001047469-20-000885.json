Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with the sections of this report entitled \"Forward-Looking Statements,\" \"Risk Factors\" and \"Selected Financial Data,\" along with the historical consolidated financial statements including related notes, included in this report.\nOverview\nThrough our Structured Business, we invest in a diversified portfolio of structured finance assets in the multifamily, single-family rental and commercial real estate markets, primarily consisting of bridge and mezzanine loans, including junior participating interests in first mortgages, preferred and direct equity. We may also directly acquire real property and invest in real estate-related notes and certain mortgage-related securities. Through our Agency Business, we originate, sell and service a range of multifamily finance products through GSE, HUD and CMBS programs and our own Private Label loans. We retain the servicing rights and asset management responsibilities on substantially all loans we originate and sell under the GSE and HUD programs and intend to do the same for our Private Label loans. We were previously externally managed and advised by ACM and on May 31, 2017 we exercised our option to fully internalize our management team and terminate the existing management agreement. We conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT. A REIT is generally not subject to federal income tax on its REIT-taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders, provided that at least 90% of its REIT-taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met.\nOur operating performance is primarily driven by the following factors:\nNet interest income earned on our investments. Net interest income represents the amount by which the interest income earned on our assets exceeds the interest expense incurred on our borrowings. If the yield on our assets increases or the cost or borrowings decreases, this will have a positive impact on earnings. However, if the yield earned on our assets decreases or the cost of borrowings increases, this will have a negative impact on earnings. Net interest income is also directly impacted by the size and performance of our asset portfolio. We recognize the bulk of our net interest income from our Structured Business. Additionally, we recognize net interest income from loans originated through our Agency Business, which are generally sold within 60 days of origination.\nFees and other revenues recognized from originating, selling and servicing mortgage loans through the GSE and HUD programs. Revenue recognized from the origination and sale of mortgage loans consists of gains on sale of loans (net of any direct loan origination costs incurred), commitment fees, broker fees, loan assumption fees and loan origination fees. These gains and fees are collectively referred to as gain on sales, including fee-based services, net. We record income from MSRs at the time of commitment to the borrower, which represents the fair value of the expected net future cash flows associated with the rights to service mortgage loans that we originate, with the recognition of a corresponding asset upon sale. We also record servicing revenue which consists of fees received for servicing mortgage loans, net of amortization on the MSR assets recorded. Although we have long-established relationships with the GSE and HUD agencies, our operating performance would be negatively impacted if our business relationships with these agencies deteriorate.\nIncome earned from our structured transactions. Our structured transactions are primarily comprised of investments in equity affiliates, which represent unconsolidated joint venture investments formed to acquire, develop and/or sell real estate-related assets. If interest rates continue to rise, it is likely that income from these investments will continue to be significantly impacted, particularly from our investment in a residential mortgage banking business, since rising interest rates generally decrease the demand for residential real estate loans and the number of loan originations. In addition, we periodically receive distributions from our equity investments. It is difficult to forecast the timing of\nsuch payments, which can be substantial in any given quarter. We account for structured transactions within our Structured Business.\nCredit quality of our loans and investments, including our servicing portfolio. Effective portfolio management is essential to maximize the performance and value of our loan and investment and servicing portfolios. Maintaining the credit quality of the loans in our portfolios is of critical importance. Loans that do not perform in accordance with their terms may have a negative impact on earnings and liquidity.\nSignificant Developments During 2019\nCapital Markets Activity. We raised $713.5 million of capital, primarily through public offerings of our common stock, issuances of senior debt and convertible senior debt. We used a significant portion of the net proceeds from these capital raises to make investments related to our business, to redeem higher cost convertible senior debt and for general corporate purposes. See Note 11 and Note 17 for details.\nFinancing Activity.\n\u2022 We closed our eleventh and twelfth collateralized securitization vehicles (CLO XI and CLO XII) totaling $1.29 billion of real estate related assets and cash, of which $1.07 billion of investment grade notes were issued to third party investors and $120.7 million of below investment-grade notes and a $97.1 million equity interest in the portfolio were retained by us;\n\u2022 We completed the unwind of CLO VI and CLO VII, redeeming $529.3 million of outstanding notes which were repaid primarily from refinancing the remaining assets within our existing financing facilities (including CLO XI and CLO XII), as well as with cash held by CLO VI and CLO VII; and\n\u2022 We increased the capacity in our credit facilities and repurchase agreements by approximately $1.00 billion, primarily from new facilities entered into in our Structured Business.\nSee Note 11 for details of our financing activity.\nDividend. We raised our quarterly common dividend three times during 2019 to $0.30 per share, an 11% increase over the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of 2018 of $0.27 per share.\nAgency Business Activity.\n\u2022 Loan originations and sales totaled $4.81 billion and $4.40 billion, respectively;\n\u2022 Our fee-based servicing portfolio grew 8% to $20.06 billion from $18.60 billion at December 31, 2018; and\n\u2022 In the second half of 2019, we began originating and servicing permanent financing loans underwritten using the guidelines of our existing agency loans (our Private Label loans); during 2019, we originated $401.2 million in loans under this new product, which is included in the total loan originations noted above.\nStructured Business Activity.\n\u2022 Our Structured loan and investment portfolio grew 30% to $4.28 billion on loan originations totaling $2.80 billion, partially offset by loan runoff totaling $1.75 billion; and\n\u2022 During 2019, we began underwriting loans for single-family rental portfolios and originated $108.4 million under this new product, which is included in the total loan originations noted above.\nCurrent Market Conditions, Risks and Recent Trends\nOur ability to execute our business strategy, particularly the growth of our Structured Business portfolio of loans and investments, depends on many factors, including our ability to access capital and financing on favorable terms. The past economic downturn had a significant negative impact on both us and our borrowers and limited our ability for growth. If similar economic conditions recur in the future, it may limit our options for raising capital and obtaining financing on favorable terms and may also adversely impact the creditworthiness of our borrowers which could result in their inability to repay their loans.\nWe rely on the capital markets to generate capital for financing the growth of our business. While we have been successful in generating capital through the debt and equity markets over the past several years, there can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to such markets. If we were to experience a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets, it could cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly.\nThe trend in recent years of the Federal Reserve gradually increasing the federal funds rate was reversed in 2019 as they reduced the rate three times from 5.50% at the beginning of 2019 to the current rate of 4.75%. While lower interest rates generally have a positive impact on origination volume as borrowers look to refinance loans to take advantage of lower rates, our net interest income may be negatively impacted as higher yielding loans are paid off and replaced with lower yielding loans. To date, we have not been significantly impacted by rate changes and do not anticipate a significant decline in origination volume or profitability as interest rates remain at relatively low levels. However, we cannot be certain that such a trend will continue as the number, timing, and magnitude of additional increases or decreases by the Federal Reserve, combined with other macroeconomic and market factors, may have a different effect on the commercial real estate market and on us.\nThe Trump administration continues to focus on several issues that could impact interest rates and the U.S. economy. While there is uncertainty regarding the specifics and timing of any future policy changes, any such actions could impact our business.\nWe are a national originator with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the GSEs remain the most significant providers of capital to the multifamily market. In September 2019, the FHFA announced a revised cap structure to its previously released GSE 2019 Scorecard. The loan origination caps for both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were adjusted to $100 billion for each enterprise for a combined total of $200 billion (\"2019/2020 Caps\") and will run for a five-quarter period through the end of 2020. The 2019/2020 Caps apply to all multifamily business and has no exclusions. Our originations with the GSEs are highly profitable executions as they provide significant gains from the sale of our loans, non-cash gains related to MSRs and servicing revenues. Therefore, a decline in our GSE originations could negatively impact our financial results. We are unsure whether the FHFA will impose stricter limitations on GSE multifamily production volume in the future.\nThe commercial real estate markets remain strong, but uncertainty remains as a result of global market instability, the current political climate and other matters and their potential impact on the U.S. economy and commercial real estate markets. In addition, the growth in multifamily rental rates seen over the past few years are showing signs of stabilizing. If real estate values decline and/or rent growth subsides, it may limit our new mortgage loan originations since borrowers often use increases in the value of, and revenues produced from, their existing properties to support the purchase or investment in additional properties. Declining real estate values may also significantly increase the likelihood that we will incur losses on our loans in the event of default because the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our cost on the loan. Any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect both our net interest income from loans as well as our\nability to originate, sell and securitize loans, which would significantly impact our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nThe economic environment over the past few years has seen continued improvement in commercial real estate values, which has generally increased payoffs and reduced the credit exposure in our loan and investment portfolio. We have made, and continue to make, modifications and extensions to loans when it is economically feasible to do so. In some cases, a modification is a more viable alternative to foreclosure proceedings when a borrower cannot comply with loan terms. In doing so, lower borrower interest rates, combined with non-performing loans, would lower our net interest margins when comparing interest income to our costs of financing. However, over the past several years, the levels of modifications and delinquencies have generally declined as property values have increased and borrowers' access to financing has improved. If the markets were to deteriorate and the U.S. experienced a prolonged economic downturn, we believe there could be additional loan modifications and delinquencies, which may result in reduced net interest margins and additional losses throughout our sector.\nChanges in Financial Condition\nAssets-Comparison of balances at December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018:\nOur Structured loan and investment portfolio balance was $4.28 billion and $3.28 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This increase was primarily due to loan originations exceeding loan payoffs and paydowns by $1.05 billion. See below for details.\nOur portfolio had a weighted average current interest pay rate of 5.98% and 7.02% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Including certain fees earned and costs associated with the structured portfolio, the weighted average current interest rate was 6.68% and 7.66% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Advances on our financing facilities totaled $3.93 billion and $2.89 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with a weighted average funding cost of 3.82% and 4.66%, respectively, which excludes financing costs. Including financing costs, the weighted average funding rate was 4.35% and 5.24% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nActivity from our Structured Business portfolio is comprised of the following ($ in thousands):\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2019 </th> <th> </th> <th>2018 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans originated\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,803,251 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,656,020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.36 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans paid-off / paid-down\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>\n1,748,387 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>\n955,575 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.60 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans extended\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>\n808,140 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>\n425,162 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoans held-for-sale from the Agency Business increased $379.7 million, primarily related to $401.2 million of Private Label loan originations.

repaid prior to nine months from the loan's maturity. The majority of our loan servicing portfolio has a prepayment protection term and therefore, we may collect a prepayment fee which is included as a component of servicing revenue, net.\n(2)Delinquent loans reflect loans that are contractually 60 days or more past due. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, delinquent loans totaled $59.2 million and $35.6 million, respectively, of which $33.5 million and $35.6 million, respectively, were in the foreclosure process. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, loans collateralizing our servicing portfolio totaling $3.2 million are currently in bankruptcy.\nOur servicing portfolio represents commercial real estate loans originated in our Agency Business, which are generally transferred or sold within 60 days to 180 days from the date the loan is funded. Primarily all of the loans in our servicing portfolio are collateralized by multifamily properties. In addition, we are generally required to share in the risk of any losses associated with loans sold under the Fannie Mae DUS program, see Note 12.\nComparison of Results of Operations for Years Ended

amortized cost for securities and principal amount for debt.\n(2)Weighted average yield calculated based on annualized interest income or expense divided by average carrying value.\nNet Interest Income\nThe increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase of $63.1 million, or 28%, from our Structured Business. The increase was primarily due to a 24% increase in our average core interest-earning assets, as a result of loan originations exceeding loan runoff, and a 3% increase in the average yield on core interest-earning assets. The increase in the average yield was largely due to increases in the average LIBOR rate, acceleration fees from early runoff and default interest and fees on a loan that paid off during 2019. In addition, LIBOR floors on a portion of our loans resulted in an increase to interest income, which is due to the decline in the LIBOR during the second half of 2019.\nThe increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase of $32.1 million, or 23%, from our Structured Business. The increase was primarily due to a 28% increase in the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, due to growth in our loan portfolio and the issuance of additional CLO and unsecured debt. The increase was partially offset by a 4% decrease in the average cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily due to an increase in accelerated deferred financing costs from the\nredemptions of our CLOs and senior unsecured notes in 2019, as compared to 2018, partially offset by an increase in the average LIBOR rate.\nAgency Business Revenue\nThe decrease in gain on sales, including fee-based services, net was primarily due to a decrease of $523.0 million, or 11%, in loan sales volume, partially offset by a 5% increase in sales margin (gain on sale, including fee-based services, net as a percentage of loan sales volume) from 1.42% to 1.49%.\nThe decrease in income from MSRs was primarily due to a 3% decrease in the MSR rate (income from MSRs as a percentage of loan commitment volume) from 1.94% to 1.88%, as well as a decrease of $274.4 million, or 5%, in loan commitment volume.\nThe increase in servicing revenue, net was primarily due to an increase in our servicing portfolio and an increase in earnings on escrows due to increases in average escrow balances and the average LIBOR rate. Our servicing portfolio increased 8% from $18.60 billion at December 31, 2018 to $20.06 billion at December 31, 2019. Our servicing revenue, net in 2019 and 2018, included $48.7 million and $48.1 million, respectively, of amortization expense.\nOther Income, Net\nThe decrease in other income, net was primarily due to changes in the fair value of rate lock commitments, partially offset by gains recognized on Swap Futures in our Agency Business. See Note 13 for details.\nOther Expenses\nThe increase in employee compensation and benefits expense is comprised of $7.8 million from our Agency Business and $3.8 million from our Structured Business. Increases in salary and stock-based compensation expense for both businesses is primarily due to increased headcount associated with each business's portfolio growth.\nThe increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in our Structured Business, mainly from higher professional fees, as well as increases in general administrative expenses.\nImpairment loss on real estate owned was $1.0 million and $2.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. During these periods, we received market analysis which resulted in impairment losses on our real estate properties owned. See Note 9 for details.\nThe decrease in our provision for loss sharing was primarily related to a $1.0 million recovery recorded on loans that fully paid off in 2019 and a $1.7 million specific provision recorded in 2018.\nThe provision for loan losses in 2018 was primarily related to a $12.3 million provision recorded on six loans secured by a land development project, partially offset by reserve recoveries of $3.1 million related to previously written-off loans and investments.\nThe litigation settlement gain in 2018 was due to net proceeds received in July 2018 from the settlement of a litigation related to a prior investment.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nThe loss on extinguishment of debt in both 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to the exchange transactions of our convertible notes. See Note 11 for details.\nIncome from Equity Affiliates\nIncome from equity affiliates in 2019 primarily reflects income from our investment in a residential mortgage banking business of $7.2 million and distributions from an equity investment totaling $3.5 million. Income from equity affiliates in 2018 primarily reflects distributions from an equity investment totaling $2.5 million and $0.7 million of income from our investment in a residential mortgage banking business, partially offset by a $2.2 million other-than-temporary impairment recorded on one of our investments. See Note 8 for details.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn 2019 and 2018, we recorded a tax provision of $15.0 million and $9.7 million, respectively. The tax provision recorded in 2019 consisted of a current tax provision of $14.9 million and a deferred tax provision of $0.2 million. The tax provision in 2018 consisted of a current tax provision of $21.8 million and a deferred tax benefit of $12.0 million. The deferred tax benefit in 2018 was due primarily to our payoff in January 2018 of the $50.0 million preferred equity interest entered into with ACM to finance a portion of the Acquisition purchase price.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\nThe noncontrolling interest relates to the outstanding OP Units issued as part of the Acquisition. There were 20,484,094 OP Units and 20,653,584 OP Units outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which represented 15.7% and 19.7% of our outstanding stock at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nComparison of Results of Operations for Years Ended 2018 and 2017\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended 2018 compared to 2017, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was filed with the SEC on February 15, 2019, and is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and the \"Investor Relations\" section of our website at www.arbor.com.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity. Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet our potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, satisfaction of collateral requirements under the Fannie Mae DUS risk-sharing agreement and, as an approved designated seller/servicer of Freddie Mac's SBL program, operational liquidity requirements of the GSE agencies, fund new loans and investments, fund operating costs and distributions to our stockholders, as well as other general business needs. Our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of proceeds from equity and debt offerings, debt facilities and cash flows from our operations. We closely monitor our liquidity position and believe our existing sources of funds and access to additional liquidity will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs.\nWhile we have been successful in obtaining proceeds from debt and equity offerings, CLOs and certain financing facilities, there is no guarantee that these forms of financing will continue to be available or available at attractive terms. Therefore, we will continue to rely, in part, on cash flows provided by operating and investing activities for working capital.\nTo maintain our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT-taxable income. These distribution requirements limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations. However, we believe that our capital\nresources and access to financing will provide us with financial flexibility and market responsiveness at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements.\nCash Flows. Cash flows used in operating activities totaled $226.5 million during 2019, primarily due to net cash outflows of $374.2 million as a result of loan originations exceeding loan sales in our Agency Business (mainly from $401.2 million of Private Label loan originations which have not yet been sold and securitized), partially offset by net income of $155.2 million.\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $994.7 million during 2019. Loan and investment activity (originations and payoffs/paydowns) comprise the bulk of our investing activities. Loan originations from our Structured Business totaling $2.71 billion, net of payoffs and paydowns of $1.75 billion, resulted in net cash outflows of $958.7 million. Cash outflows also included $20.0 million to purchase SFR bonds and $13.5 million of investments in two new equity investments.\nCash flows provided by financing activities totaled $1.39 billion during 2019, and consisted primarily of net proceeds of $1.07 billion from CLO activity, net cash inflows of $543.0 million from debt facility activities (funded loan originations were greater than facility paydowns), $464.0 million received from the issuance of senior unsecured debt and $260.4 million of net proceeds from the issuances of common stock. These cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows of $761.2 million for the redemption of CLOs and certain convertible senior unsecured notes and $138.8 million of distributions to our stockholders and OP Unit holders.\nAgency Business Requirements. The Agency Business is subject to supervision by certain regulatory agencies. Among other things, these agencies require us to meet certain minimum net worth, operational liquidity and restricted liquidity collateral requirements, purchase and loss obligations and compliance with reporting requirements. Our adjusted net worth and operational liquidity exceeded the agencies' requirements as of December 31, 2019. Our restricted liquidity and purchase and loss obligations were satisfied with letters of credit totaling $50.0 million and $1.9 million of cash collateral. See Note 15 for details about our performance regarding these requirements.\nWe also enter into contractual commitments with borrowers providing rate lock commitments while simultaneously entering into forward sale commitments with investors. These commitments are outstanding for short periods of time (generally less than 60 days) and are described in Note 13.\nDebt Facilities. We maintain various forms of short-term and long-term financing arrangements. Borrowings underlying these arrangements are primarily secured by a significant amount of our loans\nand investments and all of our loans held-for-sale. The following is a summary of our debt facilities (in thousands):\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>December 31, 2019 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Debt Facilities\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Commitment(1) </th> <th> </th> <th>UPB(2) </th> <th> </th> <th>Available </th> <th> </th> <th>Maturity\nDates </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Structured Business\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit facilities and repurchase agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,698,603 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>936,768 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>761,835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 - 2022 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collateralized loan obligations(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,147,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,147,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 - 2024 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt fund(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 - 2023 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior unsecured notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>325,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>325,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 - 2024 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible senior unsecured notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300,914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300,914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 - 2022 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Junior subordinated notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>154,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>154,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2034 - 2037 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Structured Business total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,696,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,934,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>761,835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agency Business\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit facilities(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,100,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>744,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,356,068 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>6,796,766 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>4,678,863 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,117,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes temporary increases to committed amounts which have not expired as of December 31, 2019.\n(2)Excludes the impact of deferred financing costs.\n(3)Maturity dates represent the weighted average remaining maturity based on the underlying collateral as of December 31, 2019.\n(4)The Multifamily As Soon as Pooled \u00ae Plus (\"ASAP\") agreement we have with Fannie Mae has no expiration date.\nThese debt facilities, including their restrictive covenants, are described in Note 11.\nContractual Obligations.

The carrying value is $140.9 million, which is net of a deferred amount of $11.4 million and deferred financing fees of $2.0 million at December 31, 2019.\n(5)In accordance with certain loans and investments, we have outstanding unfunded commitments that we are obligated to fund as the borrowers meet certain requirements. Specific requirements include, but are not limited to, property renovations, building construction and building conversions based on criteria met by the borrower in accordance with the loan agreements. The payment due by period is based on the maturity date of underlying loans and is included in loans and investments, net in the consolidated balance sheet.\n(6)Represents the operating lease payments due in connection with our lease of office space and equipment for our corporate headquarters and loan origination, support and servicing offices located throughout the U.S. Certain of the office leases have escalation clauses.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2019, we had no off-balance-sheet arrangements.\nInflation. Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the economy in response to changes in the rate of inflation generally have little effect on our income because the majority of our\ninterest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have floating rates of interest. See \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" below.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage the potential loss exposure caused by fluctuations of interest rates. See Note 13 for details.\nSignificant Accounting Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification\u2122, the authoritative reference for accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in Note 2. Many of these accounting policies require judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions when applying these policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Each quarter, we assess these estimates and assumptions based on several factors, including historical experience, which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are subject to change in the future if any of the underlying assumptions or factors change.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFunds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations. We present funds from operations (\"FFO\") and adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\") because we believe they are important supplemental measures of our operating performance in that they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other parties in the evaluation of REITs. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciated real properties, plus impairments of depreciated real properties and real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated ventures.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we updated our definition of AFFO to (i) exclude one-time gains and losses on the early extinguishment of debt, (ii) exclude gains and losses on derivative instruments associated with Private Label loans that have not yet been sold and securitized and (iii) include the cumulative gains or losses on derivative instruments associated with Private Label loans that were sold during the periods presented. All prior period amounts presented below have been conformed to reflect this change. Therefore, we now define AFFO as funds from operations adjusted for accounting items such as non-cash stock-based compensation expense, income from MSRs, gains or losses on Private Label-related derivative instruments until the loans are sold, changes in fair value of GSE-related derivatives that temporarily flow through earnings, amortization and write-offs of MSRs, deferred taxes and amortization of convertible senior notes conversion options. We also add back one-time charges such as acquisition costs, gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, impairment losses on real estate and gains (losses) on sales of real estate. We are generally not in the business of operating real estate property and had obtained real estate by foreclosure or through partial or full settlement of mortgage debt related to our loans to maximize the value of the collateral and minimize our exposure. Therefore, we deem such impairment and gains on real estate as an extension of the asset management of our loans, thus a recovery of principal or additional loss on our initial investment.\nFFO and AFFO are not intended to be an indication of our cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) or a measure of our liquidity, nor is it entirely indicative of\nfunding our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Our calculation of FFO and AFFO may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.\nFFO and AFFO are as follows ($ in thousands, except share and per share data):\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th>

improvement in commercial real estate values, which has generally increased payoffs and reduced the credit exposure in our loan and investment portfolio. We have made, and continue to make, modifications and extensions to loans when it is economically feasible to do so. In some cases, a modification is a more viable alternative to foreclosure proceedings when a borrower cannot comply with loan terms. In doing so, lower borrower interest rates, combined with non-performing loans, would lower our net interest margins when comparing interest income to our costs of financing. However, over the past several years, the levels of modifications and delinquencies have generally declined as property values have increased and borrowers' access to financing has improved.

The tax provision in 2018 consisted of a current tax provision of $21.8 million and a deferred tax benefit of $12.0 million. The deferred tax benefit in 2018 was due primarily to our payoff in January 2018 of the $50.0 million preferred equity interest entered into with ACM to finance a portion of the Acquisition purchase

portfolio balance was $4.28 billion and $3.28 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This increase was primarily due to loan originations exceeding loan payoffs and paydowns by $1.05 billion. See below for details.\nNet interest income earned on our investments. Net interest income represents the amount by which the interest income earned on our assets exceeds the interest expense incurred on our borrowings. If the yield on our assets increases or the cost or borrowings decreases, this will have a positive impact on earnings. However, if the yield earned on our assets decreases or the cost of borrowings increases, this will have a negative impact on earnings. Net interest income is also directly impacted by the size and performance of our asset portfolio. We recognize the bulk of our net interest income from our Structured Business. Additionally, we recognize net interest income from loans originated through our Agency Business, which are generally sold within 60 days of origination.\nThe increase in servicing revenue, net was primarily due to an increase in our servicing portfolio and an increase in earnings on escrows due to increases in average escrow balances and the average LIBOR rate. Our servicing portfolio increased 8% from $18.60 billion at December 31, 2018 to $20.06 billion at December 31, 2019. Our servicing revenue, net in 2019 and 2018, included $48.7 million and $48.1 million, respectively, of amortization expense.\nAgency Business Revenue\n\nDividend. We raised our quarterly common dividend three times during 2019 to $0.30 per share, an 11% increase over the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of 2018 of $0.27 per share.\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2019 </th> <th> </th> <th>2018 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans originated\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,803,251 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,656,020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.36 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans paid-off / paid-down\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>\n1,748,387 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>\n955,575 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.60 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans extended\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>\n808,140 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>\n425,162 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in Note 2. Many of these accounting policies require judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions when applying these policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

These estimates are subject to change in the future if any of the underlying assumptions or factors change.\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Loan\nOriginations </th> <th> </th> <th>Loan Sales </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fannie Mae\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>3,346,272 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>3,296,523 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Freddie Mac\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>728,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>786,993 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FHA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,095 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106,271 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CMBS/Conduit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>211,325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>211,325 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Private Label\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>401,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>4,810,225 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>4,401,112 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended 2018 compared to 2017, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was filed with the SEC on February 15, 2019, and is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and the \"Investor Relations\" section of our website at www.arbor.com.\nActivity from our Structured Business portfolio is comprised of the following ($ in thousands):\n\nThese debt facilities, including their restrictive covenants, are described in Note 11.\n\n(1)Represents principal amounts due based on contractual maturities. Excludes the total projected interest payments on our debt obligations of $145.4 million in 2020, $117.3 million in 2021, $98.5 million in 2022, $42.8 million in 2023, $18.7 million in 2024 and $142.4 million thereafter based on current LIBOR rates.\nability to originate, sell and securitize loans, which would significantly impact our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nInvestments in equity affiliates increased $20.2 million, primarily due to investments in two new joint ventures totaling $13.3 million, and income from our investment in a residential mortgage banking business of $7.2 million. See Note 8 for details.\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $994.7 million during 2019. Loan and investment activity (originations and payoffs/paydowns) comprise the bulk of our investing activities. Loan originations from our Structured Business totaling $2.71 billion, net of payoffs and paydowns of $1.75 billion, resulted in net cash outflows of $958.7 million. Cash outflows also included $20.0 million to purchase SFR bonds and $13.5 million of investments in two new equity investments.\n(1)Based on UPB for loans, amortized cost for securities and principal amount for debt.\n\u2022 In the second half of 2019, we began originating and servicing permanent financing loans underwritten using the guidelines of our existing agency loans (our Private Label loans); during 2019, we originated $401.2 million in loans under this new product, which is included in the total loan originations noted above.\n\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with the sections of this report entitled \"Forward-Looking Statements,\" \"Risk Factors\" and \"Selected Financial Data,\" along with the historical consolidated financial statements including related notes, included in this report.\n\nOther Expenses\nDistributions\nDue from related party increased $9.4 million, primarily due to funds from payoffs to be remitted by our affiliated servicing operations related to real estate transactions at the end of the reporting period. These amounts were remitted to us in early 2020.\nTo maintain our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT-taxable income. These distribution requirements limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations. However, we believe that our capital\nDebt Facilities. We maintain various forms of short-term and long-term financing arrangements. Borrowings underlying these arrangements are primarily secured by a significant amount of our loans\n(2)Comprised of debt totaling $282.9 million for CLO VIII, $356.4 million for CLO IX, $441.0 million for CLO X, $533.0 million for CLO XI and $534.2 million for CLO XII with a weighted average contractual maturity of 1.81 years, 1.92 years, 1.94 years, 2.47 years and 3.25 years, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.\nWe issued 516,691 shares of restricted stock to our employees, including our chief executive officer, 55,244 shares to the independent members of the Board of Directors and up to 352,427 shares of performance-based restricted common stock units and 246,508 shares of performance-based restricted stock to our chief executive officer during 2019. See Note 17 for details.\nWe rely on the capital markets to generate capital for financing the growth of our business. While we have been successful in generating capital through the debt and equity markets over the past several years, there can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to such markets. If we were to experience a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets, it could cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly.\nCash Flows. Cash flows used in operating activities totaled $226.5 million during 2019, primarily due to net cash outflows of $374.2 million as a result of loan originations exceeding loan sales in our Agency Business (mainly from $401.2 million of Private Label loan originations which have not yet been sold and securitized), partially offset by net income of $155.2 million.\nAgency Business Activity.\nComparison of Results of Operations for Years Ended 2018 and 2017\nOther liabilities increased $15.5 million, primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, which required us to record an operating lease liability, and an increase in certain accrued expenses (such as accrued compensation and professional fees), partially offset by the payment made in 2019 of the special dividend declared in 2018.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we updated our definition of AFFO to (i) exclude one-time gains and losses on the early extinguishment of debt, (ii) exclude gains and losses on derivative instruments associated with Private Label loans that have not yet been sold and securitized and (iii) include the cumulative gains or losses on derivative instruments associated with Private Label loans that were sold during the periods presented. All prior period amounts presented below have been conformed to reflect this change. Therefore, we now define AFFO as funds from operations adjusted for accounting items such as non-cash stock-based compensation expense, income from MSRs, gains or losses on Private Label-related derivative instruments until the loans are sold, changes in fair value of GSE-related derivatives that temporarily flow through earnings, amortization and write-offs of MSRs, deferred taxes and amortization of convertible senior notes conversion options. We also add back one-time charges such as acquisition costs, gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, impairment losses on real estate and gains (losses) on sales of real estate. We are generally not in the business of operating real estate property and had obtained real estate by foreclosure or through partial or full settlement of mortgage debt related to our loans to maximize the value of the collateral and minimize our exposure. Therefore, we deem such impairment and gains on real estate as an extension of the asset management of our loans, thus a recovery of principal or additional loss on our initial investment.\nCredit facilities and repurchase agreements increased $542.7 million, primarily due to funding of new structured loan activity and an increase in financings on our loans held-for-sale, as a result of Private Label loan originations.\nCollateralized loan obligations increased $536.6 million, primarily due to the issuance of two new CLOs, where we issued $1.07 billion of notes to third party investors, partially offset by the unwind of two CLOs totaling $529.3 million.\nFinancing Activity.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\nThe increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase of $63.1 million, or 28%, from our Structured Business. The increase was primarily due to a 24% increase in our average core interest-earning assets, as a result of loan originations exceeding loan runoff, and a 3% increase in the average yield on core interest-earning assets. The increase in the average yield was largely due to increases in the average LIBOR rate, acceleration fees from early runoff and default interest and fees on a loan that paid off during 2019. In addition, LIBOR floors on a portion of our loans resulted in an increase to interest income, which is due to the decline in the LIBOR during the second half of 2019.\nFFO and AFFO are as follows ($ in thousands, except share and per share data):\nThe increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in our Structured Business, mainly from higher professional fees, as well as increases in general administrative expenses.\nsuch payments, which can be substantial in any given quarter. We account for structured transactions within our Structured Business.\n\nStructured Business Activity.\nDue to related party was $13.1 million at December 31, 2019 and consisted of loan payoffs, holdbacks and escrows to be remitted to our affiliated servicing operations related to real estate transactions.\nThe increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase of $32.1 million, or 23%, from our Structured Business. The increase was primarily due to a 28% increase in the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, due to growth in our loan portfolio and the issuance of additional CLO and unsecured debt. The increase was partially offset by a 4% decrease in the average cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily due to an increase in accelerated deferred financing costs from the\nSignificant Accounting Estimates\n(4)The Multifamily As Soon as Pooled \u00ae Plus (\"ASAP\") agreement we have with Fannie Mae has no expiration date.\nComparison of Results of Operations for Years Ended 2019 and 2018\n(1)Prepayments reflect loans repaid prior to nine months from the loan's maturity. The majority of our loan servicing portfolio has a prepayment protection term and therefore, we may collect a prepayment fee which is included as a component of servicing revenue, net.\nThe decrease in other income, net was primarily due to changes in the fair value of rate lock commitments, partially offset by gains recognized on Swap Futures in our Agency Business. See Note 13 for details.\n\u2022 During 2019, we began underwriting loans for single-family rental portfolios and originated $108.4 million under this new product, which is included in the total loan originations noted above.\nAgency Servicing Portfolio\nOur servicing portfolio represents commercial real estate loans originated in our Agency Business, which are generally transferred or sold within 60 days to 180 days from the date the loan is funded. Primarily all of the loans in our servicing portfolio are collateralized by multifamily properties. In addition, we are generally required to share in the risk of any losses associated with loans sold under the Fannie Mae DUS program, see Note 12.\nOther Income, Net\n(2)Weighted average yield calculated based on annualized interest income or expense divided by average carrying value.\nSee Note 11 for details of our financing activity.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022 We closed our eleventh and twelfth collateralized securitization vehicles (CLO XI and CLO XII) totaling $1.29 billion of real estate related assets and cash, of which $1.07 billion of investment grade notes were issued to third party investors and $120.7 million of below investment-grade notes and a $97.1 million equity interest in the portfolio were retained by us;\n(1)The dividend declared on February 1, 2019 was for December 1, 2018 through February 28, 2019.

The past economic downturn had a significant negative impact on both us and our borrowers and limited our ability for growth. If similar economic conditions recur in the future, it may limit our options for raising capital and obtaining financing on favorable terms and may also adversely impact the creditworthiness of our borrowers which could result in their inability to repay their loans.\nThe following table presents the average balance of our Structured Business interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, associated interest income (expense) and the corresponding weighted average yields ($ in thousands):\n(5)In accordance with certain loans and investments, we have outstanding unfunded commitments that we are obligated to fund as the borrowers meet certain requirements. Specific requirements include, but are not limited to, property renovations, building construction and building conversions based on criteria met by the borrower in accordance with the loan agreements. The payment due by period is based on the maturity date of underlying loans and is included in loans and investments, net in the consolidated balance sheet.\nContractual Obligations. As of December 31, 2019, we had the following material contractual obligations (in thousands):\n\u2022 Loan originations and sales totaled $4.81 billion and $4.40 billion, respectively;\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards CodificationTM, the authoritative reference for accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nChanges in Financial Condition\nFunds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations. We present funds from operations (\"FFO\") and adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\") because we believe they are important supplemental measures of our operating performance in that they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other parties in the evaluation of REITs. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciated real properties, plus impairments of depreciated real properties and real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated ventures.\n(1)Amounts are attributable to common stockholders and OP Units holders. The OP Units are redeemable for cash, or at our option for shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis.\nCapital Markets Activity. We raised $713.5 million of capital, primarily through public offerings of our common stock, issuances of senior debt and convertible senior debt. We used a significant portion of the net proceeds from these capital raises to make investments related to our business, to redeem higher cost convertible senior debt and for general corporate purposes. See Note 11 and Note 17 for details.\nThe noncontrolling interest relates to the outstanding OP Units issued as part of the Acquisition. There were 20,484,094 OP Units and 20,653,584 OP Units outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which represented 15.7% and 19.7% of our outstanding stock at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSenior unsecured notes increased $197.3 million, primarily due to the issuances of an additional $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes during 2019. See Note 11 for details.\n(2)Delinquent loans reflect loans that are contractually 60 days or more past due. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, delinquent loans totaled $59.2 million and $35.6 million, respectively, of which $33.5 million and $35.6 million, respectively, were in the foreclosure process. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, loans collateralizing our servicing portfolio totaling $3.2 million are currently in bankruptcy.\nNet Interest Income\nFFO and AFFO are not intended to be an indication of our cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) or a measure of our liquidity, nor is it entirely indicative of\n\n(6)Represents the operating lease payments due in connection with our lease of office space and equipment for our corporate headquarters and loan origination, support and servicing offices located throughout the U.S. Certain of the office leases have escalation clauses.\nDuring 2019, we sold 19.8 million shares of our common stock through two public stock offerings and our \"At-The-Market\" agreement, raising net proceeds of $260.6 million. We also issued 4.7 million shares of our common stock in connection with the exchanges of our convertible notes. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the first public offering to purchase an aggregate of 0.9 million shares of our common stock from our chief executive officer and ACM during 2019. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the second public offering to purchase, in February 2020, an aggregate of 0.7 million shares of our common stock and OP Units from our chief executive officer and ACM.

These cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows of $761.2 million for the redemption of CLOs and certain convertible senior unsecured notes and $138.8 million of distributions to our stockholders and OP Unit holders.\nresources and access to financing will provide us with financial flexibility and market responsiveness at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe are a national originator with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the GSEs remain the most significant providers of capital to the multifamily market. In September 2019, the FHFA announced a revised cap structure to its previously released GSE 2019 Scorecard. The loan origination caps for both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were adjusted to $100 billion for each enterprise for a combined total of $200 billion (\"2019/2020 Caps\") and will run for a five-quarter period through the end of 2020. The 2019/2020 Caps apply to all multifamily business and has no exclusions. Our originations with the GSEs are highly profitable executions as they provide significant gains from the sale of our loans, non-cash gains related to MSRs and servicing revenues. Therefore, a decline in our GSE originations could negatively impact our financial results. We are unsure whether the FHFA will impose stricter limitations on GSE multifamily production volume in the future.\nThe decrease in income from MSRs was primarily due to a 3% decrease in the MSR rate (income from MSRs as a percentage of loan commitment volume) from 1.94% to 1.88%, as well as a decrease of $274.4 million, or 5%, in loan commitment volume.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\n(4)Represents the face amount due upon maturity. The carrying value is $140.9 million, which is net of a deferred amount of $11.4 million and deferred financing fees of $2.0 million at December 31, 2019.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2019, we had no off-balance-sheet arrangements.\nLoans held-for-sale from the Agency Business increased $379.7 million, primarily related to $401.2 million of Private Label loan originations. Our Agency Business loan originations and loan sales during 2019 are noted in the following table (in thousands). Our GSE loans are generally sold within\nOur operating performance is primarily driven by the following factors:\nWhile we have been successful in obtaining proceeds from debt and equity offerings, CLOs and certain financing facilities, there is no guarantee that these forms of financing will continue to be available or available at attractive terms. Therefore, we will continue to rely, in part, on cash flows provided by operating and investing activities for working capital.\nfunding our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Our calculation of FFO and AFFO may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.\nSources of Liquidity. Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet our potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, satisfaction of collateral requirements under the Fannie Mae DUS risk-sharing agreement and, as an approved designated seller/servicer of Freddie Mac's SBL program, operational liquidity requirements of the GSE agencies, fund new loans and investments, fund operating costs and distributions to our stockholders, as well as other general business needs. Our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of proceeds from equity and debt offerings, debt facilities and cash flows from our operations. We closely monitor our liquidity position and believe our existing sources of funds and access to additional liquidity will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs.\nIncome earned from our structured transactions. Our structured transactions are primarily comprised of investments in equity affiliates, which represent unconsolidated joint venture investments formed to acquire, develop and/or sell real estate-related assets. If interest rates continue to rise, it is likely that income from these investments will continue to be significantly impacted, particularly from our investment in a residential mortgage banking business, since rising interest rates generally decrease the demand for residential real estate loans and the number of loan originations. In addition, we periodically receive distributions from our equity investments. It is difficult to forecast the timing of\nOur portfolio had a weighted average current interest pay rate of 5.98% and 7.02% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Including certain fees earned and costs associated with the structured portfolio, the weighted average current interest rate was 6.68% and 7.66% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Advances on our financing facilities totaled $3.93 billion and $2.89 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with a weighted average funding cost of 3.82% and 4.66%, respectively, which excludes financing costs. Including financing costs, the weighted average funding rate was 4.35% and 5.24% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe provision for loan losses in 2018 was primarily related to a $12.3 million provision recorded on six loans secured by a land development project, partially offset by reserve recoveries of $3.1 million related to previously written-off loans and investments.\nOverview\n\nAssets-Comparison of balances at December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018:\nFees and other revenues recognized from originating, selling and servicing mortgage loans through the GSE and HUD programs. Revenue recognized from the origination and sale of mortgage loans consists of gains on sale of loans (net of any direct loan origination costs incurred), commitment fees, broker fees, loan assumption fees and loan origination fees. These gains and fees are collectively referred to as gain on sales, including fee-based services, net. We record income from MSRs at the time of commitment to the borrower, which represents the fair value of the expected net future cash flows associated with the rights to service mortgage loans that we originate, with the recognition of a corresponding asset upon sale. We also record servicing revenue which consists of fees received for servicing mortgage loans, net of amortization on the MSR assets recorded. Although we have long-established relationships with the GSE and HUD agencies, our operating performance would be negatively impacted if our business relationships with these agencies deteriorate.\nThe decrease in gain on sales, including fee-based services, net was primarily due to a decrease of $523.0 million, or 11%, in loan sales volume, partially offset by a 5% increase in sales margin (gain on sale, including fee-based services, net as a percentage of loan sales volume) from 1.42% to 1.49%.\nand investments and all of our loans held-for-sale. The following is a summary of our debt facilities (in thousands):\nSecurities held-to-maturity increased $12.3 million, primarily due to the purchase of $20.0 million of single-family rental (\"SFR\") bonds, partially offset by principal payments received from underlying loan payoffs from our B Piece bonds.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe commercial real estate markets remain strong, but uncertainty remains as a result of global market instability, the current political climate and other matters and their potential impact on the U.S. economy and commercial real estate markets. In addition, the growth in multifamily rental rates seen over the past few years are showing signs of stabilizing. If real estate values decline and/or rent growth subsides, it may limit our new mortgage loan originations since borrowers often use increases in the value of, and revenues produced from, their existing properties to support the purchase or investment in additional properties. Declining real estate values may also significantly increase the likelihood that we will incur losses on our loans in the event of default because the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our cost on the loan. Any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect both our net interest income from loans as well as our\nAgency Business Requirements. The Agency Business is subject to supervision by certain regulatory agencies. Among other things, these agencies require us to meet certain minimum net worth, operational liquidity and restricted liquidity collateral requirements, purchase and loss obligations and compliance with reporting requirements. Our adjusted net worth and operational liquidity exceeded the agencies' requirements as of December 31, 2019. Our restricted liquidity and purchase and loss obligations were satisfied with letters of credit totaling $50.0 million and $1.9 million of cash collateral. See Note 15 for details about our performance regarding these requirements.\nInflation. Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the economy in response to changes in the rate of inflation generally have little effect on our income because the majority of our\ninterest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have floating rates of interest. See \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" below.\nImpairment loss on real estate owned was $1.0 million and $2.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. During these periods, we received market analysis which resulted in impairment losses on our real estate properties owned. See Note 9 for details.\n\nThe litigation settlement gain in 2018 was due to net proceeds received in July 2018 from the settlement of a litigation related to a prior investment.\nThe increase in employee compensation and benefits expense is comprised of $7.8 million from our Agency Business and $3.8 million from our Structured Business. Increases in salary and stock-based compensation expense for both businesses is primarily due to increased headcount associated with each business's portfolio growth.\nThe following table presents dividends declared (on a per share basis) for 2019:\nThe trend in recent years of the Federal Reserve gradually increasing the federal funds rate was reversed in 2019 as they reduced the rate three times from 5.50% at the beginning of 2019 to the current rate of 4.75%. While lower interest rates generally have a positive impact on origination volume as borrowers look to refinance loans to take advantage of lower rates, our net interest income may be negatively impacted as higher yielding loans are paid off and replaced with lower yielding loans. To date, we have not been significantly impacted by rate changes and do not anticipate a significant decline in origination volume or profitability as interest rates remain at relatively low levels. However, we cannot be certain that such a trend will continue as the number, timing, and magnitude of additional increases or decreases by the Federal Reserve, combined with other macroeconomic and market factors, may have a different effect on the commercial real estate market and on us.\nCredit quality of our loans and investments, including our servicing portfolio. Effective portfolio management is essential to maximize the performance and value of our loan and investment and servicing portfolios. Maintaining the credit quality of the loans in our portfolios is of critical importance. Loans that do not perform in accordance with their terms may have a negative impact on earnings and liquidity.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe decrease in our provision for loss sharing was primarily related to a $1.0 million recovery recorded on loans that fully paid off in 2019 and a $1.7 million specific provision recorded in 2018.\n\u2022 We increased the capacity in our credit facilities and repurchase agreements by approximately $1.00 billion, primarily from new facilities entered into in our Structured Business.\n(2)Excludes the impact of deferred financing costs.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIncome from equity affiliates in 2019 primarily reflects income from our investment in a residential mortgage banking business of $7.2 million and distributions from an equity investment totaling $3.5 million. Income from equity affiliates in 2018 primarily reflects distributions from an equity investment totaling $2.5 million and $0.7 million of income from our investment in a residential mortgage banking business, partially offset by a $2.2 million other-than-temporary impairment recorded on one of our investments. See Note 8 for details.\nLiabilities-Comparison of balances at December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018:\n\u2022 Our fee-based servicing portfolio grew 8% to $20.06 billion from $18.60 billion at December 31, 2018; and\nWe also enter into contractual commitments with borrowers providing rate lock commitments while simultaneously entering into forward sale commitments with investors. These commitments are outstanding for short periods of time (generally less than 60 days) and are described in Note 13.\nThe loss on extinguishment of debt in both 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to the exchange transactions of our convertible notes. See Note 11 for details.\nThrough our Structured Business, we invest in a diversified portfolio of structured finance assets in the multifamily, single-family rental and commercial real estate markets, primarily consisting of bridge and mezzanine loans, including junior participating interests in first mortgages, preferred and direct equity. We may also directly acquire real property and invest in real estate-related notes and certain mortgage-related securities. Through our Agency Business, we originate, sell and service a range of multifamily finance products through GSE, HUD and CMBS programs and our own Private Label loans. We retain the servicing rights and asset management responsibilities on substantially all loans we originate and sell under the GSE and HUD programs and intend to do the same for our Private Label loans. We were previously externally managed and advised by ACM and on May 31, 2017 we exercised our option to fully internalize our management team and terminate the existing management agreement. We conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT. A REIT is generally not subject to federal income tax on its REIT-taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders, provided that at least 90% of its REIT-taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met.\nCommon Stock-On February 13, 2020, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on March 17, 2020 to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 28, 2020.\n60 days, while our Private Label loans are expected to be sold and securitized within 180 days from the loan origination date.\nPreferred Stock-On January 31, 2020, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.515625 per share of 8.25% Series A preferred stock; a cash dividend of $0.484375 per share of 7.75% Series B preferred stock; and a cash dividend of $0.53125 per share of 8.50% Series C preferred stock. These amounts reflect dividends from December 1, 2019 through February 29, 2020 and are payable on March 2, 2020 to preferred stockholders of record on February 15, 2020.\nOther assets increased $39.7 million, primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, which required us to record an operating lease ROU asset (see Note 2 for details), an increase in interest and fee receivables and the 2019 purchase of over-the-counter interest rate swap futures (\"Swap Futures\").\n\u2022 Our Structured loan and investment portfolio grew 30% to $4.28 billion on loan originations totaling $2.80 billion, partially offset by loan runoff totaling $1.75 billion; and\nSignificant Developments During 2019\nThe Trump administration continues to focus on several issues that could impact interest rates and the U.S. economy. While there is uncertainty regarding the specifics and timing of any future policy changes, any such actions could impact our business.", "item_7_text": "Deferred Compensation\nWe enter into derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage the potential loss exposure caused by fluctuations of interest rates. See Note 13 for details.\nConvertible senior unsecured notes, net increased $29.4 million, primarily due to the issuance of $264.0 million of 4.75% convertible notes, partially offset by the exchange of $228.7 million of our 5.25% convertible notes.\n\u2022 We completed the unwind of CLO VI and CLO VII, redeeming $529.3 million of outstanding notes which were repaid primarily from refinancing the remaining assets within our existing financing facilities (including CLO XI and CLO XII), as well as with cash held by CLO VI and CLO VII; and\nThe economic environment over the past few years has seen continued improvement in commercial real estate values, which has generally increased payoffs and reduced the credit exposure in our loan and investment portfolio. We have made, and continue to make, modifications and extensions to loans when it is economically feasible to do so. In some cases, a modification is a more viable alternative to foreclosure proceedings when a borrower cannot comply with loan terms. In doing so, lower borrower interest rates, combined with non-performing loans, would lower our net interest margins when comparing interest income to our costs of financing. However, over the past several years, the levels of modifications and delinquencies have generally declined as property values have increased and borrowers' access to financing has improved. If the markets were to deteriorate and the U.S. experienced a prolonged economic downturn, we believe there could be additional loan modifications and delinquencies, which may result in reduced net interest margins and additional losses throughout our sector.\n(1)Includes temporary increases to committed amounts which have not expired as of December 31, 2019.\n(3)Maturity dates represent the weighted average remaining maturity based on the underlying collateral as of December 31, 2019.\nIncome from Equity Affiliates\n(3)The weighted average contractual maturity of the underlying loans is 1.55 years.\nIn 2019 and 2018, we recorded a tax provision of $15.0 million and $9.7 million, respectively. The tax provision recorded in 2019 consisted of a current tax provision of $14.9 million and a deferred tax provision of $0.2 million. The tax provision in 2018 consisted of a current tax provision of $21.8 million and a deferred tax benefit of $12.0 million. The deferred tax benefit in 2018 was due primarily to our payoff in January 2018 of the $50.0 million preferred equity interest entered into with ACM to finance a portion of the Acquisition purchase price.\nThe following table provides our consolidated operating results ($ in thousands):\nOur Structured loan and investment portfolio balance was $4.28 billion and $3.28 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This increase was primarily due to loan originations exceeding loan payoffs and paydowns by $1.05 billion. See below for details.\nNet interest income earned on our investments. Net interest income represents the amount by which the interest income earned on our assets exceeds the interest expense incurred on our borrowings. If the yield on our assets increases or the cost or borrowings decreases, this will have a positive impact on earnings. However, if the yield earned on our assets decreases or the cost of borrowings increases, this will have a negative impact on earnings. Net interest income is also directly impacted by the size and performance of our asset portfolio. We recognize the bulk of our net interest income from our Structured Business. Additionally, we recognize net interest income from loans originated through our Agency Business, which are generally sold within 60 days of origination.\nThe increase in servicing revenue, net was primarily due to an increase in our servicing portfolio and an increase in earnings on escrows due to increases in average escrow balances and the average LIBOR rate. Our servicing portfolio increased 8% from $18.60 billion at December 31, 2018 to $20.06 billion at December 31, 2019. Our servicing revenue, net in 2019 and 2018, included $48.7 million and $48.1 million, respectively, of amortization expense.\nAgency Business Revenue\n\nDividend. We raised our quarterly common dividend three times during 2019 to $0.30 per share, an 11% increase over the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of 2018 of $0.27 per share.\n\nA summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in Note 2. Many of these accounting policies require judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions when applying these policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Each quarter, we assess these estimates and assumptions based on several factors, including historical experience, which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are subject to change in the future if any of the underlying assumptions or factors change.\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended 2018 compared to 2017, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was filed with the SEC on February 15, 2019, and is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and the \"Investor Relations\" section of our website at www.arbor.com.\nActivity from our Structured Business portfolio is comprised of the following ($ in thousands):\n\nThese debt facilities, including their restrictive covenants, are described in Note 11.\n\n(1)Represents principal amounts due based on contractual maturities.

See Note 8 for details.\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $994.7 million during 2019. Loan and investment activity (originations and payoffs/paydowns) comprise the bulk of our investing activities. Loan originations from our Structured Business totaling $2.71 billion, net of payoffs and paydowns of $1.75 billion, resulted in net cash outflows of $958.7 million. Cash outflows also included $20.0 million to purchase SFR bonds and $13.5 million of investments in two new equity investments.\n(1)Based on UPB for loans, amortized cost for securities and principal amount for debt.\n\u2022 In the second half of 2019, we began originating and servicing permanent financing loans underwritten using the guidelines of our existing agency loans (our Private Label loans); during 2019, we originated $401.2 million in loans under this new product, which is included in the total loan originations noted above.\n\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with the sections of this report entitled \"Forward-Looking Statements,\" \"Risk Factors\" and \"Selected Financial Data,\" along with the historical consolidated financial statements including related notes, included in this report.\n\nOther Expenses\nDistributions\nDue from related party increased $9.4 million, primarily due to funds from payoffs to be remitted by our affiliated servicing operations related to real estate transactions at the end of the reporting period. These amounts were remitted to us in early 2020.\nTo maintain our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT-taxable income. These distribution requirements limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations. However, we believe that our capital\nDebt Facilities. We maintain various forms of short-term and long-term financing arrangements. Borrowings underlying these arrangements are primarily secured by a significant amount of our loans\n(2)Comprised of debt totaling $282.9 million for CLO VIII, $356.4 million for CLO IX, $441.0 million for CLO X, $533.0 million for CLO XI and $534.2 million for CLO XII with a weighted average contractual maturity of 1.81 years, 1.92 years, 1.94 years, 2.47 years and 3.25 years, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.\nWe issued 516,691 shares of restricted stock to our employees, including our chief executive officer, 55,244 shares to the independent members of the Board of Directors and up to 352,427 shares of performance-based restricted common stock units and 246,508 shares of performance-based restricted stock to our chief executive officer during 2019. See Note 17 for details.\nWe rely on the capital markets to generate capital for financing the growth of our business. While we have been successful in generating capital through the debt and equity markets over the past several years, there can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to such markets. If we were to experience a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets, it could cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly.\nCash Flows. Cash flows used in operating activities totaled $226.5 million during 2019, primarily due to net cash outflows of $374.2 million as a result of loan originations exceeding loan sales in our Agency Business (mainly from $401.2 million of Private Label loan originations which have not yet been sold and securitized), partially offset by net income of $155.2 million.\nAgency Business Activity.\nComparison of Results of Operations for Years Ended 2018 and 2017\nOther liabilities increased $15.5 million, primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, which required us to record an operating lease liability, and an increase in certain accrued expenses (such as accrued compensation and professional fees), partially offset by the payment made in 2019 of the special dividend declared in 2018.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we updated our definition of AFFO to (i) exclude one-time gains and losses on the early extinguishment of debt, (ii) exclude gains and losses on derivative instruments associated with Private Label loans that have not yet been sold and securitized and (iii) include the cumulative gains or losses on derivative instruments associated with Private Label loans that were sold during the periods presented. All prior period amounts presented below have been conformed to reflect this change. Therefore, we now define AFFO as funds from operations adjusted for accounting items such as non-cash stock-based compensation expense, income from MSRs, gains or losses on Private Label-related derivative instruments until the loans are sold, changes in fair value of GSE-related derivatives that temporarily flow through earnings, amortization and write-offs of MSRs, deferred taxes and amortization of convertible senior notes conversion options. We also add back one-time charges such as acquisition costs, gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, impairment losses on real estate and gains (losses) on sales of real estate. We are generally not in the business of operating real estate property and had obtained real estate by foreclosure or through partial or full settlement of mortgage debt related to our loans to maximize the value of the collateral and minimize our exposure. Therefore, we deem such impairment and gains on real estate as an extension of the asset management of our loans, thus a recovery of principal or additional loss on our initial investment.\nCredit facilities and repurchase agreements increased $542.7 million, primarily due to funding of new structured loan activity and an increase in financings on our loans held-for-sale, as a result of Private Label loan originations.\nCollateralized loan obligations increased $536.6 million, primarily due to the issuance of two new CLOs, where we issued $1.07 billion of notes to third party investors, partially offset by the unwind of two CLOs totaling $529.3 million.\nFinancing Activity.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\nThe increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase of $63.1 million, or 28%, from our Structured Business. The increase was primarily due to a 24% increase in our average core interest-earning assets, as a result of loan originations exceeding loan runoff, and a 3% increase in the average yield on core interest-earning assets. The increase in the average yield was largely due to increases in the average LIBOR rate, acceleration fees from early runoff and default interest and fees on a loan that paid off during 2019. In addition, LIBOR floors on a portion of our loans resulted in an increase to interest income, which is due to the decline in the LIBOR during the second half of 2019.\nFFO and AFFO are as follows ($ in thousands, except share and per share data):\nThe increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in our Structured Business, mainly from higher professional fees, as well as increases in general administrative expenses.\nsuch payments, which can be substantial in any given quarter. We account for structured transactions within our Structured Business.\n\nStructured Business Activity.\nDue to related party was $13.1 million at December 31, 2019 and consisted of loan payoffs, holdbacks and escrows to be remitted to our affiliated servicing operations related to real estate transactions.\nThe increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase of $32.1 million, or 23%, from our Structured Business. The increase was primarily due to a 28% increase in the average balance of our interest-bearing liabilities, due to growth in our loan portfolio and the issuance of additional CLO and unsecured debt. The increase was partially offset by a 4% decrease in the average cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily due to an increase in accelerated deferred financing costs from the\nSignificant Accounting Estimates\n(4)The Multifamily As Soon as Pooled \u00ae Plus (\"ASAP\") agreement we have with Fannie Mae has no expiration date.\nComparison of Results of Operations for Years Ended 2019 and 2018\n(1)Prepayments reflect loans repaid prior to nine months from the loan's maturity. The majority of our loan servicing portfolio has a prepayment protection term and therefore, we may collect a prepayment fee which is included as a component of servicing revenue, net.\nThe decrease in other income, net was primarily due to changes in the fair value of rate lock commitments, partially offset by gains recognized on Swap Futures in our Agency Business. See Note 13 for details.\n\u2022 During 2019, we began underwriting loans for single-family rental portfolios and originated $108.4 million under this new product, which is included in the total loan originations noted above.\nAgency Servicing Portfolio\nOur servicing portfolio represents commercial real estate loans originated in our Agency Business, which are generally transferred or sold within 60 days to 180 days from the date the loan is funded. Primarily all of the loans in our servicing portfolio are collateralized by multifamily properties. In addition, we are generally required to share in the risk of any losses associated with loans sold under the Fannie Mae DUS program, see Note 12.\nOther Income, Net\n(2)Weighted average yield calculated based on annualized interest income or expense divided by average carrying value.\nSee Note 11 for details of our financing activity.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022 We closed our eleventh and twelfth collateralized securitization vehicles (CLO XI and CLO XII) totaling $1.29 billion of real estate related assets and cash, of which $1.07 billion of investment grade notes were issued to third party investors and $120.7 million of below investment-grade notes and a $97.1 million equity interest in the portfolio were retained by us;\n(1)The dividend declared on February 1, 2019 was for December 1, 2018 through February 28, 2019. The dividend declared on May 1, 2019 was for March 1, 2019 through May 31, 2019. The dividend declared on July 31, 2019 was for June 1, 2019 through August 31, 2019. The dividend declared on October 30, 2019 was for September 1, 2019 through November 30, 2019.\nredemptions of our CLOs and senior unsecured notes in 2019, as compared to 2018, partially offset by an increase in the average LIBOR rate.\nOur ability to execute our business strategy, particularly the growth of our Structured Business portfolio of loans and investments, depends on many factors, including our ability to access capital and financing on favorable terms. The past economic downturn had a significant negative impact on both us and our borrowers and limited our ability for growth. If similar economic conditions recur in the future, it may limit our options for raising capital and obtaining financing on favorable terms and may also adversely impact the creditworthiness of our borrowers which could result in their inability to repay their loans.\nThe following table presents the average balance of our Structured Business interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, associated interest income (expense) and the corresponding weighted average yields ($ in thousands):\n(5)In accordance with certain loans and investments, we have outstanding unfunded commitments that we are obligated to fund as the borrowers meet certain requirements. Specific requirements include, but are not limited to, property renovations, building construction and building conversions based on criteria met by the borrower in accordance with the loan agreements. The payment due by period is based on the maturity date of underlying loans and is included in loans and investments, net in the consolidated balance sheet.\nContractual Obligations. As of December 31, 2019, we had the following material contractual obligations (in thousands):\n\u2022 Loan originations and sales totaled $4.81 billion and $4.40 billion, respectively;\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards CodificationTM, the authoritative reference for accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nChanges in Financial Condition\nFunds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations. We present funds from operations (\"FFO\") and adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\") because we believe they are important supplemental measures of our operating performance in that they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other parties in the evaluation of REITs. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciated real properties, plus impairments of depreciated real properties and real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated ventures.\n(1)Amounts are attributable to common stockholders and OP Units holders. The OP Units are redeemable for cash, or at our option for shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis.\nCapital Markets Activity. We raised $713.5 million of capital, primarily through public offerings of our common stock, issuances of senior debt and convertible senior debt. We used a significant portion of the net proceeds from these capital raises to make investments related to our business, to redeem higher cost convertible senior debt and for general corporate purposes. See Note 11 and Note 17 for details.\nThe noncontrolling interest relates to the outstanding OP Units issued as part of the Acquisition. There were 20,484,094 OP Units and 20,653,584 OP Units outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which represented 15.7% and 19.7% of our outstanding stock at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSenior unsecured notes increased $197.3 million, primarily due to the issuances of an additional $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes during 2019. See Note 11 for details.\n(2)Delinquent loans reflect loans that are contractually 60 days or more past due. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, delinquent loans totaled $59.2 million and $35.6 million, respectively, of which $33.5 million and $35.6 million, respectively, were in the foreclosure process. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, loans collateralizing our servicing portfolio totaling $3.2 million are currently in bankruptcy.\nNet Interest Income\nFFO and AFFO are not intended to be an indication of our cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) or a measure of our liquidity, nor is it entirely indicative of\n\n(6)Represents the operating lease payments due in connection with our lease of office space and equipment for our corporate headquarters and loan origination, support and servicing offices located throughout the U.S. Certain of the office leases have escalation clauses.\nDuring 2019, we sold 19.8 million shares of our common stock through two public stock offerings and our \"At-The-Market\" agreement, raising net proceeds of $260.6 million. We also issued 4.7 million shares of our common stock in connection with the exchanges of our convertible notes. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the first public offering to purchase an aggregate of 0.9 million shares of our common stock from our chief executive officer and ACM during 2019. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the second public offering to purchase, in February 2020, an aggregate of 0.7 million shares of our common stock and OP Units from our chief executive officer and ACM.

These cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows of $761.2 million for the redemption of CLOs and certain convertible senior unsecured notes and $138.8 million of distributions to our stockholders and OP Unit holders.\nresources and access to financing will provide us with financial flexibility and market responsiveness at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe are a national originator with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the GSEs remain the most significant providers of capital to the multifamily market. In September 2019, the FHFA announced a revised cap structure to its previously released GSE 2019 Scorecard. The loan origination caps for both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were adjusted to $100 billion for each enterprise for a combined total of $200 billion (\"2019/2020 Caps\") and will run for a five-quarter period through the end of 2020. The 2019/2020 Caps apply to all multifamily business and has no exclusions. Our originations with the GSEs are highly profitable executions as they provide significant gains from the sale of our loans, non-cash gains related to MSRs and servicing revenues. Therefore, a decline in our GSE originations could negatively impact our financial results. We are unsure whether the FHFA will impose stricter limitations on GSE multifamily production volume in the future.\nThe decrease in income from MSRs was primarily due to a 3% decrease in the MSR rate (income from MSRs as a percentage of loan commitment volume) from 1.94% to 1.88%, as well as a decrease of $274.4 million, or 5%, in loan commitment volume.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\n(4)Represents the face amount due upon maturity. The carrying value is $140.9 million, which is net of a deferred amount of $11.4 million and deferred financing fees of $2.0 million at December 31, 2019.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements. At December 31, 2019, we had no off-balance-sheet arrangements.\nLoans held-for-sale from the Agency Business increased $379.7 million, primarily related to $401.2 million of Private Label loan originations. Our Agency Business loan originations and loan sales during 2019 are noted in the following table (in thousands). Our GSE loans are generally sold within\nOur operating performance is primarily driven by the following factors:\nWhile we have been successful in obtaining proceeds from debt and equity offerings, CLOs and certain financing facilities, there is no guarantee that these forms of financing will continue to be available or available at attractive terms. Therefore, we will continue to rely, in part, on cash flows provided by operating and investing activities for working capital.\nfunding our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Our calculation of FFO and AFFO may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.\nSources of Liquidity. Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet our potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, satisfaction of collateral requirements under the Fannie Mae DUS risk-sharing agreement and, as an approved designated seller/servicer of Freddie Mac's SBL program, operational liquidity requirements of the GSE agencies, fund new loans and investments, fund operating costs and distributions to our stockholders, as well as other general business needs. Our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of proceeds from equity and debt offerings, debt facilities and cash flows from our operations. We closely monitor our liquidity position and believe our existing sources of funds and access to additional liquidity will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs.\nIncome earned from our structured transactions. Our structured transactions are primarily comprised of investments in equity affiliates, which represent unconsolidated joint venture investments formed to acquire, develop and/or sell real estate-related assets. If interest rates continue to rise, it is likely that income from these investments will continue to be significantly impacted, particularly from our investment in a residential mortgage banking business, since rising interest rates generally decrease the demand for residential real estate loans and the number of loan originations. In addition, we periodically receive distributions from our equity investments. It is difficult to forecast the timing of\nOur portfolio had a weighted average current interest pay rate of 5.98% and 7.02% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Including certain fees earned and costs associated with the structured portfolio, the weighted average current interest rate was 6.68% and 7.66% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Advances on our financing facilities totaled $3.93 billion and $2.89 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with a weighted average funding cost of 3.82% and 4.66%, respectively, which excludes financing costs. Including financing costs, the weighted average funding rate was 4.35% and 5.24% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe provision for loan losses in 2018 was primarily related to a $12.3 million provision recorded on six loans secured by a land development project, partially offset by reserve recoveries of $3.1 million related to previously written-off loans and investments.\nOverview\n\nAssets-Comparison of balances at December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018:\nFees and other revenues recognized from originating, selling and servicing mortgage loans through the GSE and HUD programs. Revenue recognized from the origination and sale of mortgage loans consists of gains on sale of loans (net of any direct loan origination costs incurred), commitment fees, broker fees, loan assumption fees and loan origination fees. These gains and fees are collectively referred to as gain on sales, including fee-based services, net. We record income from MSRs at the time of commitment to the borrower, which represents the fair value of the expected net future cash flows associated with the rights to service mortgage loans that we originate, with the recognition of a corresponding asset upon sale. We also record servicing revenue which consists of fees received for servicing mortgage loans, net of amortization on the MSR assets recorded. Although we have long-established relationships with the GSE and HUD agencies, our operating performance would be negatively impacted if our business relationships with these agencies deteriorate.\nThe decrease in gain on sales, including fee-based services, net was primarily due to a decrease of $523.0 million, or 11%, in loan sales volume, partially offset by a 5% increase in sales margin (gain on sale, including fee-based services, net as a percentage of loan sales volume) from 1.42% to 1.49%.\nand investments and all of our loans held-for-sale. The following is a summary of our debt facilities (in thousands):\nSecurities held-to-maturity increased $12.3 million, primarily due to the purchase of $20.0 million of single-family rental (\"SFR\") bonds, partially offset by principal payments received from underlying loan payoffs from our B Piece bonds.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe commercial real estate markets remain strong, but uncertainty remains as a result of global market instability, the current political climate and other matters and their potential impact on the U.S. economy and commercial real estate markets. In addition, the growth in multifamily rental rates seen over the past few years are showing signs of stabilizing. If real estate values decline and/or rent growth subsides, it may limit our new mortgage loan originations since borrowers often use increases in the value of, and revenues produced from, their existing properties to support the purchase or investment in additional properties. Declining real estate values may also significantly increase the likelihood that we will incur losses on our loans in the event of default because the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our cost on the loan. Any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect both our net interest income from loans as well as our\nAgency Business Requirements. The Agency Business is subject to supervision by certain regulatory agencies. Among other things, these agencies require us to meet certain minimum net worth, operational liquidity and restricted liquidity collateral requirements, purchase and loss obligations and compliance with reporting requirements. Our adjusted net worth and operational liquidity exceeded the agencies' requirements as of December 31, 2019. Our restricted liquidity and purchase and loss obligations were satisfied with letters of credit totaling $50.0 million and $1.9 million of cash collateral. See Note 15 for details about our performance regarding these requirements.\nInflation. Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the economy in response to changes in the rate of inflation generally have little effect on our income because the majority of our\ninterest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have floating rates of interest. See \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" below.\nImpairment loss on real estate owned was $1.0 million and $2.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. During these periods, we received market analysis which resulted in impairment losses on our real estate properties owned. See Note 9 for details.\n\nThe litigation settlement gain in 2018 was due to net proceeds received in July 2018 from the settlement of a litigation related to a prior investment.\nThe increase in employee compensation and benefits expense is comprised of $7.8 million from our Agency Business and $3.8 million from our Structured Business. Increases in salary and stock-based compensation expense for both businesses is primarily due to increased headcount associated with each business's portfolio growth.\nThe following table presents dividends declared (on a per share basis) for 2019:\nThe trend in recent years of the Federal Reserve gradually increasing the federal funds rate was reversed in 2019 as they reduced the rate three times from 5.50% at the beginning of 2019 to the current rate of 4.75%. While lower interest rates generally have a positive impact on origination volume as borrowers look to refinance loans to take advantage of lower rates, our net interest income may be negatively impacted as higher yielding loans are paid off and replaced with lower yielding loans. To date, we have not been significantly impacted by rate changes and do not anticipate a significant decline in origination volume or profitability as interest rates remain at relatively low levels. However, we cannot be certain that such a trend will continue as the number, timing, and magnitude of additional increases or decreases by the Federal Reserve, combined with other macroeconomic and market factors, may have a different effect on the commercial real estate market and on us.\nCredit quality of our loans and investments, including our servicing portfolio. Effective portfolio management is essential to maximize the performance and value of our loan and investment and servicing portfolios. Maintaining the credit quality of the loans in our portfolios is of critical importance. Loans that do not perform in accordance with their terms may have a negative impact on earnings and liquidity.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe decrease in our provision for loss sharing was primarily related to a $1.0 million recovery recorded on loans that fully paid off in 2019 and a $1.7 million specific provision recorded in 2018.\n\u2022 We increased the capacity in our credit facilities and repurchase agreements by approximately $1.00 billion, primarily from new facilities entered into in our Structured Business.\n(2)Excludes the impact of deferred financing costs.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIncome from equity affiliates in 2019 primarily reflects income from our investment in a residential mortgage banking business of $7.2 million and distributions from an equity investment totaling $3.5 million. Income from equity affiliates in 2018 primarily reflects distributions from an equity investment totaling $2.5 million and $0.7 million of income from our investment in a residential mortgage banking business, partially offset by a $2.2 million other-than-temporary impairment recorded on one of our investments. See Note 8 for details.\nLiabilities-Comparison of balances at December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018:\n\u2022 Our fee-based servicing portfolio grew 8% to $20.06 billion from $18.60 billion at December 31, 2018; and\nWe also enter into contractual commitments with borrowers providing rate lock commitments while simultaneously entering into forward sale commitments with investors. These commitments are outstanding for short periods of time (generally less than 60 days) and are described in Note 13.\nThe loss on extinguishment of debt in both 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to the exchange transactions of our convertible notes. See Note 11 for details.\nThrough our Structured Business, we invest in a diversified portfolio of structured finance assets in the multifamily, single-family rental and commercial real estate markets, primarily consisting of bridge and mezzanine loans, including junior participating interests in first mortgages, preferred and direct equity. We may also directly acquire real property and invest in real estate-related notes and certain mortgage-related securities. Through our Agency Business, we originate, sell and service a range of multifamily finance products through GSE, HUD and CMBS programs and our own Private Label loans. We retain the servicing rights and asset management responsibilities on substantially all loans we originate and sell under the GSE and HUD programs and intend to do the same for our Private Label loans. We were previously externally managed and advised by ACM and on May 31, 2017 we exercised our option to fully internalize our management team and terminate the existing management agreement. We conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT. A REIT is generally not subject to federal income tax on its REIT-taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders, provided that at least 90% of its REIT-taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met.\nCommon Stock-On February 13, 2020, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on March 17, 2020 to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 28, 2020.\n60 days, while our Private Label loans are expected to be sold and securitized within 180 days from the loan origination date.\nPreferred Stock-On January 31, 2020, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.515625 per share of 8.25% Series A preferred stock; a cash dividend of $0.484375 per share of 7.75% Series B preferred stock; and a cash dividend of $0.53125 per share of 8.50% Series C preferred stock. These amounts reflect dividends from December 1, 2019 through February 29, 2020 and are payable on March 2, 2020 to preferred stockholders of record on February 15, 2020.\nOther assets increased $39.7 million, primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, which required us to record an operating lease ROU asset (see Note 2 for details), an increase in interest and fee receivables and the 2019 purchase of over-the-counter interest rate swap futures (\"Swap Futures\").\n\u2022 Our Structured loan and investment portfolio grew 30% to $4.28 billion on loan originations totaling $2.80 billion, partially offset by loan runoff totaling $1.75 billion; and\nSignificant Developments During 2019\nThe Trump administration continues to focus on several issues that could impact interest rates and the U.S. economy.
