Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6, \"Selected Financial and Operating Data\" and Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts in this section are referred to in thousands.\nOverview and Background\nWe are a leading provider of mission critical water treatment solutions, offering services, systems and technologies to support our customers' full water lifecycle needs. With over 200,000 installations worldwide, we hold leading positions in the industrial, commercial and municipal water treatment markets in North America. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of differentiated, proprietary technology solutions sold under a number of market-leading and well-established brands. We deliver and maintain these mission critical solutions through the largest service network in North America assuring our customers continuous uptime with 86 branches which are located no further than a two-hour drive from more than 90% of our customers' sites. We believe that the customer intimacy created through our service network is a significant competitive advantage.\nOur solutions are designed to provide \"worry-free water\" by ensuring that our customers have access to an uninterrupted quantity and level of quality of water that meets their unique product, process and recycle or reuse specifications. We enable our customers to achieve lower costs through greater uptime, throughput and efficiency in their operations and support their regulatory compliance and environmental sustainability. We have worked to protect water, the environment and our employees for over 100 years. As a result, we have earned a reputation for quality, safety and reliability and are sought out by our customers to solve the full range of their water treatment needs, and maintaining our reputation is critical to the success of our business and solution set.\nOur vision \"to be the world's first choice in water solutions\" and our values of \"integrity, customers and performance\" foster a corporate culture that is focused on employee enablement, empowerment and accountability, which creates a highly entrepreneurial and dynamic work environment. Our purpose is \"Transforming water. Enriching life.\" We draw from a long legacy of water treatment innovations and industry firsts, supported by more than 1,250 granted or pending patents, which in aggregate are important to our business. Our core technologies are primarily focused on removing impurities from water, rather than neutralizing them through the addition of chemicals, and we are able to achieve purification levels which are 1,000 times greater than typical drinking water.\nBusiness Segments\nOur business is organized by customer base and offerings into three reportable segments that each draw from the same reservoir of leading technologies, shared manufacturing infrastructure, common business processes and corporate philosophies. Our reportable segments consist of: (i) our Industrial Segment, (ii) our Municipal Segment and (iii) our Products Segment. The key factors used to identify these reportable segments are the organization and alignment of our internal operations, the nature of the products and services and customer type.\n\u2022 Within the Industrial Segment, we primarily provide tailored solutions in collaboration with our customers backed by life-cycle services including on-demand water, build-own-operated (\"BOO\"), recycle and reuse and emergency response service alternatives to improve operational reliability, performance and environmental compliance.\n\u2022 Within the Municipal Segment, we primarily deliver solutions, equipment and services to engineering firms, OEMs and municipalities to treat wastewater and purify drinking water, and to control odor and corrosion.\n\u2022 Within the Products Segment, we provide a highly differentiated and scalable range of products and technologies specified by global water treatment designers, OEMs, engineering firms and integrators.\nWe evaluate our business segments' operating results based on income from operations and EBITDA on a segment basis. Corporate activities include general corporate expenses, elimination of intersegment transactions, interest income and expense and other unallocated charges, which have not been allocated to business segments. As such, the segment results provided herein may not be comparable to other companies.\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015, 2016 and 2017, our Industrial Segment accounted for 53.6%, 53.1% and 51.6% of our revenues, respectively; our Municipal Segment accounted for 25.8%, 24.4% and 22.3% of our revenues, respectively; and our Products Segment accounted for 20.6%, 22.5% and 26.1% of revenues, respectively.\nOrganic Growth Drivers\nMarket Growth\nWe maintain a leading position among customers in growing industries that utilize water as a critical part of their operations or production processes, including pharmaceuticals and health sciences, microelectronics, food and beverage, hydrocarbon and chemical processing, power, general manufacturing, municipal drinking and wastewater, marine and aquatics. Water treatment is an essential, non-discretionary market that is growing in importance as access to clean water has become an international priority. Underpinning this growth are a number of global, long-term trends that have resulted in increasingly stringent effluent regulations, along with a growing demand for cleaner and sustainable waste streams for reuse. These trends include the growing global population, increasing levels of urbanization and continued global economic growth, and we have seen these trends manifest themselves within our various end markets creating multiple avenues of growth. For example, within the industrial market, water is an integral and meaningful component in the production of a wide-range of goods spanning from consumer electronics to automobiles.\nOur Existing Customer Base\nWe believe our strong brands, leading position in highly fragmented markets, scalable and global offerings, leading installed base and unique ability to provide complete treatment solutions will enable us to capture a larger share of our existing customers' water treatment spend while expanding with existing and new customers into adjacent end-markets and underpenetrated regions, including by investing in our sales force and cross-selling to existing customers. We are uniquely positioned to further penetrate our core markets, with over 200,000 installations across over 38,000 global customers. We maintain a customer-intimate business model with strong brand value and provide solutions-focused offerings capable of serving a customer's full lifecycle water treatment needs, both in current and new geographic regions.\nOur Service Model\nWe selectively target high value projects with opportunities for recurring business through service, parts and other aftermarket opportunities over the lifecycle of the process or capital equipment. In particular, we have developed a pipeline of smart, internet-connected monitoring technologies through the deployment of our Water One smart water platform that provides us with an increasing ability to\nhandle our customers' complete water needs through on-demand water management, predictive maintenance and service response planning. Water One also enables us to transition our customers to more accurate pricing models based on usage, which otherwise would not have been possible without technological advancement. Our technology solutions provide customers with increased stability and predictability in water-related costs, while enabling us to optimize our service route network and on demand offerings through predictive analytics, which we believe will result in market share gains, improved service levels, increased barriers to entry and reduced costs.\nProduct and Technology Development\nWe develop our technologies through in-house research, development and engineering and targeted tuck-in, technology-enhancing and geography-expanding acquisitions. We have a reservoir of recently launched technologies and a strong pipeline of new offerings designed to provide customers with innovative, value-enhancing solutions. Furthermore, we have successfully completed eight technology-enhancing and geography-expanding acquisitions since April 2016 to add new capabilities and cross-selling opportunities in areas such as electrochemical and electrochlorination cells, regenerative media filtration, anodes, UV disinfection and aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment technologies. We are able to rapidly scale new technologies using our leading direct and third-party sales channels and our relationships with key influencers, including municipal representatives, engineering firms, designers and other system specifiers. We believe our continued investment in driving penetration of our recently launched technologies, robust pipeline of new capabilities and best-in-class channels to market will allow us to continue to address our customer needs across the water lifecycle.\nOperational Excellence\nWe believe that continuous improvement of our operations, processes and organizational structure is a key driver of our earnings growth. Since fiscal 2014, we have realigned our organizational structure, achieved significant cost savings through operational efficiencies and revitalized our culture, which has energized our workforce and reduced employee turnover. We have identified and are pursuing a number of discrete initiatives which, if successful, we expect could result in additional cost savings over the next three years. These initiatives include our ePro and supply chain improvement programs to consolidate and manage global spending, our improved logistics and transportation management program, further optimizing our engineering cost structure, capturing benefits of our Water One remote system monitoring and data analytics offerings. We refer to these initiatives as \"Value Creators\" as these improvements focus on creating value for customers through reduced leadtimes, improved quality and superior customer support, while also creating value for stockholders through enhanced earnings growth. Furthermore, as a result of significant investments we have made in our footprint and facilities, we have capacity to support our planned growth without commensurate increase in fixed costs.\nAcquisitions\nWe believe that tuck-in acquisitions present a key opportunity within our overall growth strategy, which we will continue to evaluate strategically. These strategic acquisitions will enable us to accelerate our growth in our current addressable market, as well as in new geographies and new end market verticals. Our existing customer relationships, best-in-class channels to market and ability to rapidly commercialize technologies provide a strong platform to drive rapid growth in the businesses we acquire. To capitalize on these opportunities, we have built an experienced team dedicated to mergers and acquisitions that has successfully completed eight technology-enhancing and geography-expanding acquisitions since April 2016, with purchase prices ranging from approximately $3.3 million to approximately $283.7 million, and pre-acquisition revenues ranging from approximately $3.1 million to approximately $55.7 million. We will continue to actively evaluate acquisition opportunities that are\nconsistent with our business strategy and financial model, and, although we may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets and implement our growth strategy, we currently have a pipeline which includes more than 60 potential targets, which has been developed proactively by our team as well as informed by our customer base. Our acquisitions include:\n\u2022Magneto-On April 11, 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of privately held Magneto Special Anodes B.V.

The maximum earnout payment of CAD 7.5 million (or approximately $5.8 million), is payable over a period of twenty-four months based upon the achievement of certain specified performance metrics. ADI is included in the results of our Industrial Segment.\n\u2022Olson-On June 30, 2017, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of privately held Olson Irrigation Systems (\"Olson\"), a leading designer and producer of filters and irrigation components for the agriculture and industrial markets, for $9.4 million. Olson is included in the results of our Products Segment.\nKey Factors and Trends Affecting Our Business and Financial Statements\nVarious trends and other factors affect or have affected our operating results, including:\nOverall economic trends. The overall economic environment and related changes in industrial, commercial and municipal spending impact our business. In general, positive conditions in the broader economy promote industrial, commercial and municipal customer spending, while economic weakness results in a reduction of new industrial, commercial and municipal project activity. Macroeconomic factors that can affect customer spending patterns, and thereby our results of operations, include population growth, total water consumption, municipal budgets, employment rates, business conditions, the availability of credit or capital, interest rates, tax rates and regulatory changes. Since the businesses of our customers vary in cyclicality, periodic downturns in any specific sector typically have modest impacts on our overall business.\nNew products and technologies. Our ability to maintain our appeal to existing customers and attract new customers depends on our ability to originate, develop and offer a compelling array of products, services and solutions responsive to evolving customer innovations, preferences and specifications. We expect that increased use of water in industrial and commercial processes will drive increased customer demand in the future, and our ability to grow will depend in part on effectively responding to innovation in our customers' processes and systems. Further, our ability to provide products that comply with evolving government regulations will also be a driver of the appeal of our products, services and solutions to industrial and commercial customers.\nChanges in costs. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, including steel, caustic, carbon, calcium nitrate and iridium, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross profit and gross margin. Further, additional potential acquisitions and international expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial, administrative and other resources. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance our management systems, financial and management controls and information systems. We will also be required to hire, train and retain operational and sales personnel, which affects our operating margins.\nGovernment policies. Decaying water systems in the United States will require critical drinking water and wastewater repairs, often led by municipal governments. Further, as U.S. states increase regulation on existing and emerging contaminants, we expect that our customers will increasingly require sustainable solutions to their water-related needs. In general, increased infrastructure investment and more stringent municipal, state and federal regulations promote increased spending on our products, services and solutions, while a slowdown in investment in public infrastructure or the elimination of key environmental regulations could result in lower industrial and municipal spending on water systems and products.\nAvailability of water. In general, we expect demand for our products and services to increase as the availability of clean water from public sources decreases. Secular trends that will drive demand for water across a multitude of industrial, commercial and municipal applications include global population growth, urbanization, industrialization and overall economic growth. In addition, the supply of clean water could be adversely impacted by factors including an aging water infrastructure within North\nAmerica and increased levels of water stress from seasonal rainfall, inadequate water storage options or treatment technologies. Because water is a critical component and byproduct of many processes, including in manufacturing and product development, we expect that, as global consumption patterns evolve and water shortages persist, demand for our equipment and services will continue to increase.\nOperational investment. Our historical operating results reflect the impact of our ongoing investments to support our growth. We have made significant investments in our business that we believe have laid the foundation for continued profitable growth. We believe that our strengthened sales force, mergers and acquisitions team, enhanced information systems, research, development and engineering investments and other factors enable us to support our operating model.\nOur ability to source and distribute products effectively. Our revenues are affected by our ability to purchase our inputs in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. While we believe our suppliers have adequate capacity to meet our current and anticipated demand, our level of revenues could be adversely affected in the event of constraints in our supply chain, including the inability of our suppliers to produce sufficient quantities of raw materials in a manner that is able to match demand from our customers.\nFluctuation in quarterly results. Our quarterly results have historically varied depending upon a variety of factors, including funding, readiness of projects and regulatory approvals. In addition, our contracts for large capital water treatment projects, systems and solutions for industrial, commercial and municipal applications are generally fixed-price contracts with milestone billings. As a result of these factors, our working capital requirements and demands on our distribution and delivery network may fluctuate during the year.\nContractual relationships with customers. Due to our large installed base and the nature of our contractual relationships with our customers, we have high visibility into a large portion of our revenue. The one- to twenty-year terms of many of our service contracts and the regular delivery and replacement of many of our products help to insulate us from the negative impact of any economic decline.\nInflation and deflation trends. Our financial results can be expected to be directly impacted by substantial increases in costs due to commodity cost increases or general inflation which could lead to a reduction in our revenues as well as greater margin pressure as increased costs may not be able to be passed on to customers. To date, changes in commodity prices and general inflation have not materially impacted our business.\nExchange rates. The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. We operate in numerous countries around the world and therefore, certain of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the euro, U.K. sterling, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Singapore dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. As a result, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items recorded in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in the functional currency. While we believe we are not susceptible to any material impact on our results of operations caused by fluctuations in exchange rates because our operations are primarily conducted in the United States, if we expand our foreign operations in the future, substantial increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these other currencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nPublic company costs. As a result of our initial public offering, we will incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur, including costs associated with SEC\nreporting and corporate governance requirements. These requirements include compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as well as other rules implemented by the SEC and the NYSE. Our financial statements following our initial public offering will reflect the impact of these expenses. In addition, the one-time grant of stock-settled restricted stock unit awards made in connection with the initial public offering to certain members of management will result in increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which will be incremental to our ongoing stock-based compensation expense. This stock-based compensation expense is expected to be expensed beginning in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2018 and continuing over the following eight fiscal quarters. For more information, please see Item 11, \"Executive Compensation-IPO Awards-Restricted Stock Units.\"\nDebt refinancings. In October 2016, we repaid our senior secured second lien term loan facility in full and revolving credit loans then-outstanding and borrowed an additional $150.0 million of term loans under our term loan facility at lower rates.\nIn August 2017, we completed an incremental financing of $80.0 million. In this transaction we combined the incremental debt tranche of approximately $183 million associated with the Neptune Benson acquisition, along with the new borrowings of $80 million into our existing first lien term loan tranche a lower interest rate. Proceeds from the incremental financing were used to repay $60 million of revolving credit facility borrowings and the remainder was placed on the balance sheet for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions. We have the option to add one or more incremental term loans under our term loan facility or revolving credit facilities or increase commitments under our revolving credit facility. Further, our revolving credit facility and term loan facility are scheduled to mature in January 2019 and January 2021, respectively, and we will need to repay, refinance, replace or otherwise extend the maturity of our senior secured credit facilities. Accordingly, our results have been and will be impacted by substantial changes in our net interest expense throughout the periods presented and in the future. See \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below.\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key indicators of the financial condition and operating performance of our business are revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA.\nRevenue\nOur sales are a function of sales volumes and selling prices, each of which is a function of the mix of product and service sales, and consist primarily of:\n\u2022 sales of tailored light industry technologies, heavy industry technologies and environmental products, services and solutions in collaboration with our industrial customers, backed by lifecycle services including emergency response services and build-own-operate alternatives, to a broad group of industrial customers in our U.S., Canada and Singapore markets;\n\u2022 sales of products, services and solutions to engineering firms and municipalities to purify drinking water and treat wastewater globally; and\n\u2022 sales of a wide variety of differentiated products and technologies, to an array of OEM, distributor, end-user, engineering firm and integrator customers in all of our geographic markets and aftermarket channels.\nCost of Sales, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit is determined by subtracting cost of product sales and cost of services from our product and services revenue. Gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our combined product and services revenue.\nCost of product sales consists of all manufacturing costs required to bring a product to a ready for sale condition, including direct and indirect materials, direct and indirect labor costs including benefits, freight, depreciation, information technology, rental and insurance, repair and maintenance, utilities, other manufacturing costs, warranties and third party commissions.\nCost of services primarily consists of the cost of personnel and travel for our field service, supply chain and technicians, depreciation of equipment and field service vehicles and freight costs.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing, general and administrative and research and development expenses.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and marketing promotions of our products, services and solutions and related personnel expenses (including all Evoqua sales and application employees' base compensation and incentives), as well as sponsorship costs, consulting and contractor expenses, travel, display expenses and related amortization. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to actively promote our products, services and solutions.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of fixed overhead personnel expenses associated with our service organization (including district and branch managers, customer service, contract renewals and regeneration plant management). We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase due to the anticipated growth of our business and related infrastructure as well as legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations and other costs associated with becoming a public company.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses related to research and development, patents, sustaining engineering, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials and overhead costs allocated to such expenses. Substantially all of our research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving our existing products and services. To date, research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred, because the period between achieving technological feasibility and the release of products and services for sale has been short and development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to invest in developing new products, services and solutions and enhancing our existing products, services and solutions.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income (loss) is determined by subtracting operating expenses and interest expense from, and adding other operating income (expense), equity income from our partnership interest in TWO and income tax benefit (expense) to, gross profit. For more information on how we determine gross profit, see \"-Gross Profit.\"\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is one of the primary metrics used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax benefit (expense) and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain other items, including restructuring and related business transformation costs, purchase accounting adjustment costs, non-cash stock-based compensation, sponsor fees, transaction costs and other gains,\nlosses and expenses. We present Adjusted EBITDA, which is not a recognized financial measure under GAAP, because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, we believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results, because it excludes the results of decisions that are outside the control of management, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance as follows:\n\u2022 to assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance;\n\u2022 in our management incentive compensation which is based in part on components of Adjusted EBITDA;\n\u2022 in certain calculations under our senior secured credit facilities, which use components of Adjusted EBITDA.\n\u2022 to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies;\n\u2022 to make budgeting decisions; and\n\u2022 to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.\nIn addition to the above, our chief operating decision maker uses EBITDA of each reportable segment to evaluate the operating performance of such segments.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider it appropriate for supplemental analysis. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr>

50% partnership interest in TWO, which, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015, we accounted for under the equity method and did not consolidate, as we did not have a controlling financial interest based on the shared powers of both joint venture partners to direct the activities that most significantly impact TWO's financial performance. On October 1, 2015, a change occurred in the partnership structure of TWO such that we are now obligated to absorb all risk of loss up to 100% of the joint venture partner's equity. As such, the accounting for our 50% interest changed from equity method investment to full consolidation as a variable interest entity under ASC 810.\nFiscal Years Ended September 30, 2016 and

2016. The increase in product revenues was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson, which accounted for $68.1 million. The remaining increase was related to organic revenue growth of approximately $8.6 million in the power and microelectronics\nmarkets in the Asia region driven by product sales of electrodeionization equipment, $3.8 million from the Wallace and Tiernan business, $3.7 million from capital sales in the separation technologies product line, and $3.4 million from stronger sales of aquatic filters in the Americas region. The Municipal aftermarket business increased by $1.8 million predominantly in North America through both wastewater and MEMCOR. These revenue increases were offset by lower sales volumes in capital projects driving a decline of $2.0 million in revenues related to large project timing in both North America & United Kingdom, and $1.6 million of revenue decline related to our Italian operations in the year ended September 30, 2016 that did not reoccur due to the wind down of our operations in that geographic area.\nRevenues from services increased $22.3 million, or 4.1%, to $572.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $550.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase was driven mainly by organic revenue growth, including volume driven increases in Industrial service revenue of approximately $27.7 million associated with higher U.S. customer production levels in the general manufacturing and pharmaceutical and healthcare end markets and new account penetration in the power and hydrocarbon and chemical processing end markets, and an increase of approximately $2.4 million related to our Municipal services business. These increases were offset by approximately $7.9 million in revenues related to our Vernon location in the year ended September 30, 2016 that did not reoccur because of the Vernon Disposition as of September 30, 2016.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin-Total gross margin increased to 32% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from 29.3% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\nThe following table provides the change in cost of product sales and cost of services, respectively, along with related gross margins:\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Fiscal Year Ended September 30, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Gross\nMargin % </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Gross\nMargin % </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of product sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>407.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>445.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>396.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>401.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>804.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>847.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of product sales increased by approximately $38.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in cost of product sales was primarily driven by the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson, which accounted for $32.5 million. These accretive acquisitions were the primary driver of the increase of 330 basis points in gross margin percentage. The remaining increase in cost of product sales was due to organic growth driven by higher sales volumes due to increased U.S customer production levels in the general manufacturing and pharmaceutical and healthcare end markets and the power and microelectronics markets in the Asian region. These increases in cost of product sales were partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million related to the wind down of our Italian operations.\nCost of services increased by approximately $5.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in cost of services was related to an overall increase in revenue volume, offset by the benefits of cost efficiencies implemented as well as $7.6 million related to the cost of services attributable to the Vernon Disposition as of September 30, 2016.\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses increased $29.2 million, or 9.6%, to $332.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $302.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\nThe increase in operating expense was primarily due to expenses associated with the acquired companies of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson, which accounted for $18.4 million of the operating expense increase. A discussion of operating expenses by category is as follows:\nResearch and Development Expense-Research and development expenses decreased $2.9 million, or 12.7%, to $20.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $22.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Research and development expenses increased $1.0 million with the acquisition of Magneto and their extensive research and development programs related to anode coatings, but was offset by decrease of approximately $1.5 million in research and development expenses in connection with the consolidation and restructuring of our Singaporean research and development center as well as a reduction of approximately $0.9 million associated with a restructuring program in the Municipal Segment implemented in December, 2016.. Additionally, we received reimbursements from the Singapore government for research and development credits in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 of approximately $1.3 million.\nSales and Marketing Expense-Sales and marketing expenses increased $7.2 million, or 5.3%, to $142.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $135.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The driving factor in the increase in sales and marketing expense was an increase of $10.9 million associated with the sales and marketing activities of the acquired companies of Neptune Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson. This increase was offset by a decrease in the bad debt reserve of $2.5 million related to aligning our bad debt reserve in addition to recovering a receivable that had been previously written off.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense-General and administrative expenses increased $24.8 million, or 17.2%, to $169.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $144.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. This increase in general and administrative expenses was partially due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson, which accounted for $7.4 million of the increase. The balance of the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to costs associated with the Company's strategic transaction process of $8.1 million, costs related to restructuring and the integration of acquisitions of $3.9 million and expenses incurred related to other various strategic projects or initiatives of approximately $2.2 million.\nOther Operating Income (Expense), Net-Other operating income decreased $5.5 million, or 78.5%, to $1.5 million of income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $7.0 million of income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we sold two locations, which resulted in a gain on sale. There were no similar transactions in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.\nInterest Expense-Interest expense increased $12.9 million, or 30.2%, to $55.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $42.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in borrowing in support of acquisitions, interest on capital leases and fees associated with our senior secured credit facilities.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)-Income tax was an expense of $7.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to a benefit of $18.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, an increase of 140.2%. The effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 was 53.6% as compared to 343.0% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. This change was primarily the result of an increase in the valuation allowance during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, compared to a decrease in valuation allowance in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\nNet Income-Net income decreased by $6.6 million, or 50.8%, to net income of $6.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to net income of $13.0 million for the fiscal year\nended September 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by increased tax expense of $7.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to a tax benefit of $18.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, a difference of $25.8 million. Furthermore, $12.9 million of additional interest expense was incurred in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. These factors offset the increased revenue volume and profitability associated with the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson, which accounted for $11.6 million of increased net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. The increased volume and profitability as well as incremental benefits from restructuring activities and operational efficiencies that were implemented in the prior year (net of charges from additional restructuring actions taken in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017) contributed the remaining $1.3 million to net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA-Adjusted EBITDA increased $47.6 million, or 29.7%, to $207.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $160.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Increased volume and benefits from restructuring and operational efficiencies that we implemented in the current and prior fiscal year provided $27.0 million of the increase in Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, revenue volume and profitability associated with prior year and current year acquisitions contributed approximately $20.6 million of the increase in Adjusted EBITDA.\nSegment

The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in service revenues of $27.7 million driven by higher customer production levels in general manufacturing and pharmaceutical and healthcare end markets and new account penetration in power and hydrocarbon and chemical processing end markets. In addition, an increase of $19.4 million of revenue was attributable to our acquisitions of ETS, ADI and Noble during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. Our increased revenues were partially offset by a decrease of $7.9 million in revenues related to the Vernon Disposition as of September 30, 2016.\nOperating profit in the Industrial Segment increased $18.6 million, or 20.3%, to $110.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $91.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in operating profit was primarily related to an increase in volume of $9.4 million as well as $9.8 million of benefits experienced as a result of our Value Creator initiatives. Value Creator benefits include carry over benefits from operational efficiency initiatives that we implemented in the prior fiscal year.\nEBITDA in the Industrial Segment increased $19.8 million, or 15.3%, to $149.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $129.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in EBITDA resulted from the same factors which impacted operating profit in the Industrial Segment during this period.\nMunicipal\nRevenues in the Municipal Segment increased slightly by $0.6 million, or 0.2%, to $278.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $278.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Excluding the operations in Italy, which we are in the process of closing and resulted in a decline of $1.6 million over the same period, the overall business grew by $2.2 million, or 0.8%. Excluding Italy, the aftermarket and services revenues are up 3.3% and 2.5% respectively, while capital revenues declined by 1.6%. Timing in capital was offset by growth in both the Municipal Services and wastewater and MEMCOR aftermarket revenues as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nOperating profit in the Municipal Segment increased $5.4 million, or 17.1%, to $36.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $31.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\nThe increase in operating profit was primarily due to the continued Value Creator benefits in both project execution and ePro of $2.4 million, benefits from the alignment to a more customer focused organizational structure of $2.8 million, and reduced warranty expense of $1.3 million. This was partially offset by increased labor costs of approximately $1.8 million.\nEBITDA in the Municipal Segment increased $5.3 million, or 13.5%, to $44.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $39.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. EBITDA increased as a result of the same factors which impacted operating profit in the Municipal Segment during this period.\nProducts\nRevenues in the Products Segment increased $70.4 million, or 27.6%, to $325.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $255.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in revenues was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto and Olson. These acquisitions accounted for an aggregate of $48.7 million of the increased revenues. The Products Segment also increased revenues in the amount of $9.2 million in our power and microelectronics markets. These increases were principally due to higher product sales of electrodeionization equipment in our legal entity in China. Additionally, there were increases of $7.7 million due to growth in the aquatics and disinfection division and $3.7 million from stronger capital sales.\nOperating profit in the Products Segment increased $17.2 million, or 35.3%, to $65.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from the $48.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to the additional revenue volume and profitability associated with the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto and Olson. These acquisitions accounted for $10.1 million of the operating profit increase in the year ended September 30 2017. The aquatics and disinfection division saw operating profit grow $4.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. Operating profit in the electrodeionization equipment product lines also improved due to the increased revenues of $5.8 million in the Asia region, which accounted for $1.6 million in additional operating profit. Lastly, operating profit in the marine end markets improved $1.1 million.\nEBITDA in the Products Segment increased $22.3 million, or 40.5%, to $77.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $55.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, with $15.6 million attributable to the Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto and Olson. The balance of $6.7 million was due to growth in the other product lines and reduced operating expenses from restructuring in the prior period.\nFiscal Years Ended September 30, 2015 and September 30,

equity method and did not consolidate, as we did not have a controlling financial interest based on the shared powers of both joint venture partners to direct the activities that most significantly impact TWO's financial performance. On October 1, 2015, a change occurred in the partnership structure of TWO such that we are now obligated to absorb all risk of loss up to 100% of the joint venture partner's equity. As such, the accounting for our 50% interest changed from equity method investment to full consolidation as a variable interest entity under ASC 810.\n(2)For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to net income (loss), its most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, see \"-How We Assess the Performance of Our Business-Adjusted EBITDA.\"\nN/M-Not meaningful\nConsolidated Results\nRevenues-Revenues increased $76.2 million, or 7.2%, to $1,137.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $1,061.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.\nThe following table provides the change in revenues from product sales and revenues from services, respectively:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Fiscal Years Ended September 30, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>% of\nRevenues </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>% of\nRevenues </th> <th> </th> <th>%\nVariance </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue from product sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>533.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>587.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue from services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>527.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>550.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,061.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,137.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues from product sales increased $53.4 million, or 10.0%, to $587.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $533.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in revenues was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, ETS and Magneto. These acquisitions accounted for $44.4 million of the increase in product revenues. Other areas of product revenue growth included an increase in the execution of capital project orders of approximately $17.3 million as compared to the prior year in the power and pulp and paper end markets, as well as an increase of approximately $7.8 million for products related to highly purified water in the microelectronics and power markets with the establishment of a new legal entity and sales presence in the China market. This increase was partially offset by delays in the marine and power product retrofit markets, which experienced a decrease in product revenues of approximately $14.0 million.\nRevenues from services increased $22.8 million, or 4.3%, to $550.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $527.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Service and capital system support revenues increased in the power, hydrocarbon and chemical processing end markets for approximately $6.4 million, driven by penetration into new and existing customer accounts, as well as service business growth in the Municipal Segment for approximately $4.4 million through geographical expansion and rollout of new service offerings. The consolidation of TWO, our joint venture that sells water management equipment and services, also accounted for approximately $11.6 million of the increase in service revenues.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin-Total gross margin increased to 29.3% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from 27.6% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.\nThe following table provides the change in cost of product sales and cost of services, respectively, along with related gross margins:\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Fiscal Years Ended September 30, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Gross\nMargin % </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Gross\nMargin % </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of product sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>385.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>407.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>383.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>396.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>768.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>804.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of product sales increased by approximately $22.2 million in the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cost of sales for our products business was primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto. These acquisitions accounted for $21.2 million of the increase in cost of sales as well as a corresponding gross profit increase of approximately $23.2 million and were the primary driver of the 2.8% increase in gross margin. Increases in revenues related to capital project orders and sales in the\nmicroelectronics and power markets drove an increase in cost of sales of approximately $17.4 million, however, purchasing and supply chain productivity measures that were implemented to adjust for the standalone nature of the Company supported a reduction in cost of sales of approximately $6.2 million. Cost of product sales was also favorably impacted by the final stages of the wind down of our Italian operations, which drove a decrease of approximately $11.7 million in cost of sales and a corresponding increase in gross profit of $4.5 million as compared to the prior year. Additionally, commensurate with the delays in revenues, cost of sales were reduced in the marine and power product retrofit markets by approximately $9.7 million.\nCost of services increased approximately $13.5 million in the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2015. This was commensurate with the increase in revenue volume, offset by the beneficial impact of various restructuring initiatives put in place over the previous period.\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses increased $4.9 million, or 1.6%, to $302.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $298.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The largest driver in the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF and Delta UV accounting for $9.8 million of the operating expense increase and Magneto accounting for $2.7 million of the increase. These increases in operating expenses were offset with decreases in expenses in the other segments. A discussion of operating expenses by category is as follows:\nResearch and Development Expense-Research and development expenses decreased $3.0 million, or 11.6%, to $22.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $25.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Research and development expenses increased $0.2 million with the acquisition of Magneto and their extensive research and development programs related to anode coatings.\nSales and Marketing Expense-Sales and marketing expenses increased $10.8 million, or 8.7%, to $135.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $124.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The driving factor for the increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with reinvigoration and expansion of the sales force, which drove an increase in salaries and benefits of approximately $9.8 million, coupled with implementation of sales initiatives such as training and rebranding, which incurred approximately $1.2 million of additional cost.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense-General and administrative expenses decreased $2.9 million, or 2.0%, to $144.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $147.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto accounted for a $11.7 million increase in general and administrative expenses, which was offset by a $14.6 million decrease in general and administrative expenses as a result of restructuring actions and other cost savings initiatives taken across the business.\nOther Operating Income, Net-Other operating income increased $6.9 million to $7.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $0.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in other operating income was primarily due to a gain on disposal of assets, including the Vernon Disposition.\nInterest Expense-Interest expense increased $8.4 million, or 24.8%, to $42.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $34.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense is due to an increase in borrowing for acquisitions, interest on capital leases and fees associated with our senior secured credit facilities.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)-Income tax expense decreased $66.3 million, or 138.4%, to an income tax benefit of $18.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from an expense of\n$47.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was 343.0% compared to an effective tax rate of (125.6)% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in income tax expense and effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the benefit resulting from the release of valuation allowance as a result of additional deferred tax liabilities recognized in connection with the Neptune-Benson Acquisition.\nNet Income-Net income increased $99.1 million, or 115.1%, to net income of $13.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from a net loss of $86.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The primary driver of the increase in net income was the transition from a large tax expense of $47.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 to a tax benefit of $18.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, a change of approximately $66.3 million. The change in tax expense was related to the establishment and subsequent partial release of valuation allowance. Additional contributors to the increase in net income included the improvement in gross profit of approximately $40.7 million driven by revenue volume and profitability as discussed above, as well as the increase in other operating income of approximately $6.9 million discussed above. These contributors to net income were offset by the overall increase in operating expenses of approximately $4.9 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA-Adjusted EBITDA increased $40.2 million, or 33.5%, to $160.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $119.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Increased volume and carry over benefits from restructuring and operational efficiencies that we implemented in the prior year provided $17.1 million of the increase in Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, revenue volume and profitability associated with the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto contributed approximately $15.9 million of the increase in Adjusted EBITDA, while the final stages in closure of our Italian operations improved our profitability by $5.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\nSegment Results\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td>

The increase in revenues was primarily due to the execution of an additional $17.3 million of capital project orders compared to the prior fiscal year in the power, pulp and paper end markets. Service and capital system revenues increased in power and hydrocarbon and chemical processing end markets by $6.4 million, driven by penetration into new and existing accounts. In addition the consolidation of TWO drove a net increase in revenue of $11.6 million. This increase was partially offset by a decline in aftermarket revenue.\nOperating profit in the Industrial Segment increased $5.1 million, or 5.9%, to $91.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $86.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to increased volume of $5.8 million. Additionally, as part of the Value Creator program we initiated ePro activities, which resulted in a reduction to costs of $1.8 million and operational improvements in supply chain that resulted in reduced warranty expense and liabilities of $1.6 million. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable product mix of $4.3 million driven by large capital revenue that carries lower margins.\nEBITDA in the Industrial Segment increased $12.8 million, or 10.9%, to $129.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $116.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in EBITDA was primarily a result of the same factors which impacted operating profit in the Industrial Segment during this period. In addition, our ePro initiatives included a program to optimize fleet vehicles. This program resulted in a reduction to the fleet size, upgrades to vehicles to improve service technician productivity and conversion of the relevant contract from an operating lease to a capital lease resulting in a total increase to EBITDA of $6.8 million. These benefits were partially offset by the same factors affecting operating profit during this period.\nMunicipal\nRevenues in the Municipal Segment increased $4.4 million, or 1.6%, to $278.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $273.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in revenues was primarily due to volume sold in both our service business, through geographical expansion and new product rollouts delivering $6.6 million increase from the prior year, and growth in aftermarket $6.4 million. This is offsetting a decline of $4.5 million in capital due project\ntiming. This revenue growth was also partially offset by a decline of $4.1 million in revenues due to the final stages in closure of our Italian operations.\nOperating profit in the Municipal Segment increased $9.2 million, or 41.3%, to $31.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $22.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating profit excluding Italy was primarily due to $2.6 million from volume, and the implementation of the Value Creator program, which delivered efficiencies in order execution and $2.8 million savings in ePro. The final stages in closure of our Italian operations improved our operating profit by $5.9 million, while operational efficiencies in both project execution and ePro noted above, and continued alignment to a more customer focused organizational structure favorably drove the results by $2.1 million. This increase was partially offset by sales investments.\nEBITDA in the Municipal Segment increased $9.6 million, or 32.3%, to $39.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $29.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. EBITDA increased because of the same factors that affected operating profit in the Municipal Segment during this period, with the addition of our fleet optimization as part of our Value Creator program, converting it from an operating lease to a capital lease driving an increase of approximately $0.8 million in EBITDA.\nProducts\nRevenues in the Products Segment increased $36.7 million, or 16.8%, to $255.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $218.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto which accounted for $42.9 million of additional revenues. The increase was partially offset by delays in the marine and power product retrofit markets which experienced a decrease in product revenues of $14.0 million. Revenues for highly purified water in the microelectronics and power markets increased by $7.8 million with the establishment of a new legal entity and sales presence in China.\nOperating profit in the Products Segment increased $11.2 million, or 29.8%, to $48.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $37.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to the Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto acquisitions. The declines in operating profit in the electrochlorination, dewatering and intake product lines were offset by increases in the IonPure product line with our expansion in China.\nEBITDA in the Products Segment increased $15.9 million, or 40.5%, to $55.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $39.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in EBITDA was primarily due to the Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto acquisitions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs, debt service, acquisitions, other commitments and contractual obligations. We consider liquidity in terms of cash flows from operations and their sufficiency to fund our operating and investing activities.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash generated by operating activities and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). Historically, we have financed our operations primarily from cash generated from operations and periodic borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our primary cash needs are for day to day operations, to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness, to fund working capital requirements and to make capital expenditures.\nWe expect to continue to finance our liquidity requirements through internally generated funds and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that our projected cash flows generated\nfrom operations, together with borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are sufficient to fund our principal debt payments, interest expense, our working capital needs and our expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months. Our capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 were $57.8 million. However, our budgeted capital expenditures can vary from period to period based on the nature of capital intensive project awards. We may draw on our Revolving Credit Facility from time to time to fund or partially fund an acquisition.\nIn connection with the Acquisition, we entered into the \"Senior Secured Credit Facilities,\" which originally consisted of (a) a seven-year $505.0 million senior secured first lien term loan facility (the \"Term Loan Facility\"), scheduled to mature on January 15, 2021 and a $75.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"), scheduled to mature on January 15, 2019 and (b) a seven-year $75.0 million senior secured second lien term loan facility, scheduled to mature on January 15, 2022 (which is no longer outstanding). On April 15, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our first lien credit agreement, dated as of January 15, 2014 (the \"First Lien Credit Agreement\"), to borrow an additional $185.0 million of term loans under our Term Loan Facility to fund a portion of the consideration for the Neptune-Benson Acquisition. On October 28, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the First Lien Credit Agreement to (i) borrow an additional $150.0 million of term loans under our Term Loan Facility to fund our repayment in full of our second lien facility and revolving credit loans then outstanding and (ii) increase commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by $20.0 million to a total of $95.0 million. On August 8, 2017, we entered into another amendment to the First Lien Credit Agreement pursuant to which we (i) borrowed approximately $262.7 million in refinancing term loans, the net proceeds of which were used to refinance in their entirety the loans incurred in connection with the Neptune-Benson Acquisition and (ii) increased the amount of our existing Term Loan Facility by borrowing $80.0 million of incremental term loans under the Term Loan Facility, the net proceeds of which were used to repay $60.0 million of revolving credit loans then outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and to pay related fees and expenses, and for other general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions and permitted investments pursuant to the First Lien Credit Agreement). On November 7, 2017, we used a portion of the proceeds of our initial public offering to repay approximately $104.9 million of indebtedness (including accrued and unpaid interest) under the Term Loan Facility. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities also include an uncommitted incremental facility, which, subject to certain conditions, provides for additional term loans and/or revolving loans in an aggregate amount that does not cause our first lien net leverage ratio to exceed 4.50 to 1.00 (calculated as the ratio of consolidated funded first lien debt for borrowed money (net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) to trailing four-quarter Consolidated EBITDA (as defined therein), plus an additional $100 million (excluding incremental revolving credit loans or increases in revolving credit commitments not exceeding $30.0 million) (all of which remained available as of September 30, 2017).\nAs of September 30, 2017, we had total indebtedness of $906.8 million, including $896.6 million of borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, no borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and $10.2 million in borrowings related to a BOO financing. We also had $6.7 million of letters of credit issued under our $95.0 million Revolving Credit Facility and an additional $10.6 million of letters of credit issued under a separate uncommitted facility as of September 30, 2017.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of covenants imposing certain restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. The restrictions these covenants place on our business operations, include limitations on our or our subsidiaries' ability to:\n\u2022 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 make certain investments;\n\u2022 pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock;\n\u2022 sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022 agree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022 consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022 enter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022 incur liens; or\n\u2022 designate any of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company and do not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock, if any, is dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our operating subsidiaries. Under the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, our operating subsidiaries are currently limited in their ability to pay cash dividends to us, and we expect these limitations to continue in the future under the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities of ours or of our subsidiaries.\nIn addition, our Revolving Credit Facility, but not the Term Loan Facility, contains a financial covenant which requires us to comply with the maximum first lien net leverage ratio of 5.55 to 1.00 as of the last day of any quarter on which the aggregate amount of revolving loans and letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility (net of cash collateralized letters of credit and undrawn outstanding letters of credit in an amount of up to 50% of the Revolving Credit Facility) exceeds 25% of the total commitments thereunder.\nAs of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2017, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk and prevent us from meeting our obligations. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations.\"\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes the changes to our cash flows for the periods presented:\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Fiscal Year Ended September 30, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Statement of Cash Flows Data\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>41,944 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>31,919 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>28,502 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46,866 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(344,610 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(134,895 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,263 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>191,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114,519 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,225 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>2,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>766 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(16,410 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(118,665 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>8,892 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for restructuring activities and other items impact reported cash flows.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased to $28.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $31.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\n\u2022 Operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 reflect a decrease in net income of $6.6 million as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and increased non-cash charges of $42.4 million primarily relating to deferred taxes and increased depreciation and amortization. The increased deferred tax impacts relate to increases in valuation allowances as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 primarily driven by an increase in net operating losses incurred.\n\u2022 The aggregate of receivables, inventories, cost and earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts, accounts payable and billings in excess of costs incurred on uncompleted contracts used $61.3 million in operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 compared to $10.1 million in operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the above mentioned accounts depends upon how effectively we manage our cash conversion cycle, which is a representation of the number of days that elapse from the date of purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from customers. Our cash conversion cycle can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period. Further, as it relates to capital projects, fiscal 2017 represented a continued rebuilding of the pipeline of capital projects as compared to the period prior to the Acquisition, which represented a depletion of the pipeline of capital projects. This build-up of capital project activity contributed to the variability of accounts receivable, inventories, excess billings on uncompleted contracts or billings in excess of costs incurred on uncompleted contracts from period to period.\n\u2022 The aggregate of prepaid expense and other assets and other non current assets and liabilities used $6.6 million in operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 compared to $17.3 million provided in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The use of operational cash flow in the period ended September 30, 2017 was primarily related to the reduction of a long term lease receivable in addition and increase in the lease liability offset by a change in pension liability.\n\u2022 Accrued expenses and other liabilities used $2.2 million in operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 compared to a use of $31.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The use of operational cash flow in both periods resulted primarily from capital lease activity and timing of cash payments for various employee-related liabilities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $10.0 million to $31.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $41.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022 Operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 reflected an increase in net income of $99.1 million from fiscal 2015. Net income in fiscal 2016 included a benefit from the relief of the income tax valuation allowance of $15.4 million compared to establishing an income tax valuation allowance of $63.3 million in fiscal 2015. Additionally in fiscal 2016, net income included the non-cash impact of foreign currency losses for intracompany loans primarily denominated in euro of $0.1 million compared to $19.3 million in fiscal 2015.\n\u2022 The aggregate of receivables, inventories, cost and earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts, accounts payable and billings in excess of costs incurred on uncompleted contracts used $14.5 million in operating cash flows in fiscal 2016 compared to $19.9 million of operating cash flows provided in fiscal 2015. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the above mentioned accounts depends upon how effectively we manage our cash conversion cycle, which is a representation of the number of days that elapse from the date of purchase of raw\nmaterials and components to the collection of cash from customers. Our cash conversion cycle can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period. Further, as it relates to capital projects, fiscal 2016 represented a continued rebuilding of the pipeline of capital projects as compared to the period prior to the Acquisition, which represented a depletion of the pipeline of capital projects. This build-up of capital project activity contributed to the variability of accounts receivable, inventories, excess billings on uncompleted contracts or billings in excess of costs incurred on uncompleted contracts from period to period.\n\u2022 Accrued expenses and other liabilities used $31.4 million in operating cash flows in fiscal 2016 compared to $14.6 million used in fiscal 2015. This increased use of operational cash flow resulted primarily from the timing of cash payments for various employee-related and other restructuring activities during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\n\u2022 The aggregate of non-current assets and non-current liabilities provided $16.0 million in operating cash flows in fiscal 2016 compared to $3.2 million used in fiscal 2015. The cash flows related to this increase in fiscal 2016 include an increase in pension liabilities of $8.1 million compared to a decrease of pension liability of $0.3 million in fiscal 2015, driven by declines in discount rates used to value projected benefit obligations. Additionally, $8.8 million of long term capital leases were entered into in fiscal 2016.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $209.7 million from $344.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 to $134.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was largely driven by a reduction in the size of acquisitions completed during comparable periods. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 we spent $306.4 million to acquire Magneto, Neptune Benson, VAF and Delta. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we spent $77.8 million to acquire ETS, Noble, Olson and ADI. The reduction was partially offset by increased purchases of intangible assets and a sale of business that took place in the prior year.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $297.7 million from $46.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 to $344.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune Benson, Magneto, VAF and Delta UV, which were consummated during fiscal 2016 with a total cash outlay of $306.4 million. This cash outlay on acquisitions was offset, in part, by proceeds of $4.5 million from the Vernon Disposition, and $5.2 million on the sale of vacant facilities.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $76.9 million from $191.4 million of net cash provided by financing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 to net cash provided by financing activities of $114.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. This lower amount of cash provided by financing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 was primarily due to higher payment of debt. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we refinanced $75.0 million of our second lien facilities into our first lien facilities. In addition, we continued to repay debt in accordance with each applicable credit agreement's terms, including repayment of amounts borrowed from the Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, we paid increased dividends to the noncontrolling interest, offset by a reduction in proceeds from both capital contributions and common stock issuances.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $197.7 million from $6.3 million of net cash used in financing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 to net cash provided by financing activities of $191.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily due to issuance of debt of $185.0 million under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities proceeds from capital contributions and issuance of common stock of approximately $17.2 million, both in support of acquisition activities.\nSeasonality\nWhile we do not believe it to be significant, our business does exhibit seasonality resulting from our customers' increasing demand for our products and services during the spring and summer months as compared to the fall and winter months. For example, our Municipal Segment experiences increased demand for our odor control product lines and services in the warmer months which, together with other factors, typically results in improved performance in the second half of our fiscal year. Inclement weather, such as hurricanes, droughts and floods, can also drive increased demand for our products and services. As a result, our results from operations may vary from period to period.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2017, we had letters of credit totaling $18.1 million and $17.2 million, respectively, and surety bonds totaling $102.2 million and $87.8 million respectively, outstanding under our credit arrangements. The longest maturity date of the letters of credit and surety bonds in effect as of September 30, 2017 was March 31, 2024. Additionally, as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2017, we had letters of credit totaling $1.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, and surety bonds totaling $43.7 million and $13.0 million, respectively, outstanding under our prior arrangement with Siemens.\nContractual Obligations\nWe enter into long-term obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily debt obligations and non-cancelable operating leases. As of September 30, 2017, our contractual cash obligations over the next several periods were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 year </th> <th> </th> <th>1 to 3 years </th> <th> </th> <th>3 to 5 years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease commitments(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>54,695 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>12,205 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>18,767 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>13,363 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>10,360 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease commitments(b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,294 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations(c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>906,791 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>872,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,091 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments on long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,148,247 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>80,518 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>148,028 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>905,864 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>13,837 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)We occupy certain facilities and operate certain equipment and vehicles under non-cancelable lease arrangements. Lease agreements may contain lease escalation clauses and purchase and renewal options. We recognize scheduled lease escalation clauses over the course of the applicable lease term on a straight-line basis.\n(b)We lease certain equipment classified as capital leases. The leased equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis over the life of the lease and is included in depreciation expense.\n(c)Does not reflect the approximately $104.9 million of indebtedness (including accrued and unpaid interest) under the Term Loan Facility that we repaid in connection with our initial public offering.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments on an on-going basis.\nManagement bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nManagement evaluated the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates and believes that the following involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position, and are therefore discussed as critical. The following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations. More information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in \"Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUse of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and require management to make estimates and assumptions. These assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are used for, but not limited to: (i) revenue recognition; (ii) allowance for doubtful accounts; (iii) inventory valuation, asset valuations, impairment and recoverability assessments; (iv) depreciable lives of assets; (v) useful lives of intangible assets; (vi) income tax reserves and valuation allowances and (vii) product warranty and litigation reserves. Estimates are revised as additional information becomes available. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nAccounts Receivable\nReceivables are primarily comprised of uncollected amounts owed to us from transactions with customers and are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts. Allowances are estimated based on historical write-offs and the economic status of customers. We consider a receivable delinquent if it is unpaid after the term of the related invoice has expired. Write-offs are recorded at the time all collection efforts have been exhausted.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, where cost is generally determined on the basis of an average or first-in, first-out method. Production costs comprise direct material and labor and applicable manufacturing overheads, including depreciation charges. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write off excess or obsolete inventory based on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements. Manufacturing operations recognize cost of product sales using standard costing rates with overhead absorption which generally approximates actual cost.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. If the costs of certain components of an item of property, plant, and equipment are significant in relation to the total cost of the item, they are accounted for and depreciated separately. Depreciation expense is recognized using the straight-line method. Useful lives are reviewed annually\nand, if expectations differ from previous estimates, adjusted accordingly. Estimated useful lives for major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Asset Class\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Estimated\nUseful Life </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Machinery and equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td>3 to 20 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Buildings and improvements\n</td> <td> </td> <td>10 to 40 years </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the term of the lease. Costs related to maintenance and repairs that do not extend the assets' useful life are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe review goodwill to determine potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting unit level. We have determined that we have four reporting units. Our quantitative impairment testing utilizes both a market (guideline public company) and income (discounted cash flows) method for determining fair value. In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation technique, we incorporate our judgment and estimates of future cash flows, future revenue and gross profit growth rates, terminal value amount, capital expenditures and applicable weighted-average cost of capital used to discount these estimated cash flows. The estimates and projections used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with our current budget and long-range plans, including anticipated change in market conditions, industry trend, growth rates and planned capital expenditures, among other considerations. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value, the second step is performed, where the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Conditions that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in customer demand or business climate that could affect the value of an asset, a product recall or an adverse action by a regulator. Recoverability of the asset or asset group is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to undiscounted future net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its respective fair value which is generally determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows or as the appraised value.\nWe amortize these assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. This amortization methodology best matches the pattern of economic benefit that is expected from the definite-lived intangible assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nSales of goods and services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered.\nFor sales of aftermarket parts or products with a low level of customization and engineering time, we recognize revenues at the time title and risks and rewards of ownership pass, which is generally when products are shipped or delivered to the customer as we have no obligation for installation. Sales\nof short-term service arrangements are recognized as the services are performed, and sales of long-term service arrangements are typically recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreement.\nFor certain arrangements where there is significant customization to the product, we recognize revenue under the provisions of ASC 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. These products include large capital water treatment projects, systems and solutions for municipal and industrial applications. Revenues from construction-type contracts are generally recognized under the percentage-of-completion method, based on the input of costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated contract costs. The nature of the contracts are generally fixed price with milestone billings. Approximately $203.1 million, $218.6 million and $240.2 million of revenues from construction-type contracts were recognized on the percentage-of-completion method during the periods ending September 30, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly at a minimum and the cumulative effect of such adjustments are recognized in current operations. The amounts of such adjustments have not been material.\nApproximately $29.7 million, $33.5 million and $28.4 million of revenues from construction-type contracts were recognized on a completed contract method, which is typically when the product is delivered and accepted by the customer, during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The completed contract method is principally used when the contract is short in duration (generally less than twelve months) and where results of operations would not vary materially from those resulting from the use of the percentage-of-completion method. Cost and earnings in excess of billings under construction-type arrangements are recorded when contracts have net asset balances where contract costs plus recognized profits less recognized losses exceed progress billings. Billings in excess of costs incurred are recorded when contract progress billings exceed costs and recognized profit less recognized losses.\nProduct Warranties\nAccruals for estimated expenses related to warranties are made at the time products are sold and are recorded as a component of cost of product sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The estimated warranty obligation is based on product warranty terms offered to customers, ongoing product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs expected to be incurred in correcting a product failure, as well as specific obligations for known failures and other currently available evidence. We assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities on a regular basis and adjust amounts as necessary.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is deemed more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within a reasonable time period. We assess tax positions using a two-step process. A tax position is recognized if it meets a more-likely-than-not threshold, and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% of being realized. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed each balance sheet date.\nEquity-based Compensation\nWe account for awards of equity instruments in accordance with relevant authoritative literature. Prior to our initial public offering, given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, the fair value of the common stock underlying our share-based awards was determined by our board, with input from management, in each case using the income and market valuation approach. We believe that our board had the relevant experience and expertise to determine the fair value of our common stock. In accordance with the Accounting and Valuation Guide: Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, our board exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock including:\n\u2022 our historical and projected operating and financial results, including capital expenditures;\n\u2022 current business conditions and performance, including dispositions and discontinued operations;\n\u2022 present value of estimated future cash flows;\n\u2022 the market performance and financial results of comparable publicly-traded companies;\n\u2022 amounts of indebtedness;\n\u2022 industry or company-specific considerations;\n\u2022 likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a sale of the company;\n\u2022 lack of marketability of our common stock; and\n\u2022 the U.S. and global capital market conditions.\nThese estimates are no longer necessary to determine the fair value of new awards since the underlying shares are now publicly traded. Stock options are granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than the estimated fair market value on the date of grant as authorized by our compensation committee. Options granted vest ratably at 25% per year and are exercisable at the time of vesting. Stock option grants are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting. Prior to our initial public offering, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock option awards granted. We considered the retirement and forfeiture provisions of the options and utilized our historical experience and the experience of similar public companies to estimate the expected life of the options. We based the risk-free interest rate on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury security with a maturity generally equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant. We estimated the volatility of the share price of our common stock by considering the historical volatility of the stock of similar public entities. We estimated the dividend yield to be zero as we did not intend to pay dividends in the future. In determining the appropriateness of the public entities included in the volatility assumption we considered a number of factors, including the entity's life cycle stage, growth profile, size, financial leverage and products offered. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award, net of estimated forfeitures, and is recognized as a component of general and administrative expense over the requisite vesting period.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. The ASU includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2017. We do not expect the implementation of this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRetirement Benefits\nWe apply ASC Topic 715, Compensation-Retirement Benefits, which requires the recognition in pension obligations and accumulated other comprehensive income of actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations that have previously been deferred. The determination of retirement benefit pension obligations and associated costs requires the use of actuarial computations to estimate participant plan benefits to which the employees will be entitled. The significant assumptions primarily relate to discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, mortality, years of service and other factors. We develop each assumption using relevant experience in conjunction with market-related data for each individual country in which such plans exist. All actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually with third-party consultants and adjusted as necessary. For the recognition of net periodic postretirement cost, the calculation of the expected return on plan assets is generally derived by applying the expected long-term rate of return on the market-related value of plan assets. The fair value of plan assets is determined based on actual market prices or estimated fair value at the measurement date.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue when an entity either enters into a contract with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into a contract for the transfer of non-financial assets. ASU 2014-09 may be adopted using either of two acceptable methods: (1) retrospective adoption to each prior period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients; or (2) adoption with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain disclosures. To assess at which time revenue should be recognized, an entity should use the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The standard is effective for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2018. At this time, we are not yet able to estimate the anticipated impact to our consolidated financial statements. We are also evaluating the new disclosures required by the standard to determine what additional information will need to be disclosed.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires recognition of operating leases as lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 will be effective retrospectively for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued (ASU) 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. The ASU includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. ASU No. 2016 09 will be effective for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2017. We do not expect the implementation of this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). This new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The guidance should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, unless deemed impracticable, in which case prospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties that are under Common Control. The ASU changes how a single decision maker of a VIE that holds indirect interest in the entity through related parties that are under common control determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The new guidance amends ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, issued in February 2015. The guidance should be applied coincidentally with the adoption of ASU 2015-02, which was effective for us for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The amendments in this ASU are effective for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2020. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Scope of Modification Accounting, which amended Accounting Standards Code Topic 718. FASB issued ASU 2017-09 to reduce the cost and complexity when applying Topic 718 and standardize the practice of applying Topic 718 to financial reporting. The ASU was not developed to fundamentally change the definition of a modification, but instead to provide guidance for what changes would qualify as a modification. ASU No. 2017-09 will be effective for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2018. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "microelectronics and power markets drove an increase in cost of sales of approximately $17.4 million, however, purchasing and supply chain productivity measures that were implemented to adjust for the standalone nature of the Company supported a reduction in cost of sales of approximately $6.2 million. Cost of product sales was also favorably impacted by the final stages of the wind down of our Italian operations, which drove a decrease of approximately $11.7 million in cost of sales and a corresponding increase in gross profit of $4.5 million as compared to the prior year. Additionally, commensurate with the delays in revenues, cost of sales were reduced in the marine and power product retrofit markets by approximately $9.7 million.\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Fiscal Years Ended September 30, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>% of\nRevenues </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>% of\nRevenues </th> <th> </th> <th>%\nVariance </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue from product sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>533.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>587.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue from services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>527.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>550.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,061.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,137.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nWe believe our strong brands, leading position in highly fragmented markets, scalable and global offerings, leading installed base and unique ability to provide complete treatment solutions will enable us to capture a larger share of our existing customers' water treatment spend while expanding with existing and new customers into adjacent end-markets and underpenetrated regions, including by investing in our sales force and cross-selling to existing customers.

The increased deferred tax impacts relate to increases in valuation allowances as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 primarily driven by an increase in net operating losses incurred.\nNet Income-Net income increased $99.1 million, or 115.1%, to net income of $13.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from a net loss of $86.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The primary driver of the increase in net income was the transition from a large tax expense of $47.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 to a tax benefit of $18.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, a change of approximately $66.3 million. The change in tax expense was related to the establishment and subsequent partial release of valuation allowance. Additional contributors to the increase in net income included the improvement in gross profit of approximately $40.7 million driven by revenue volume and profitability as discussed above, as well as the increase in other operating income of approximately $6.9 million discussed above. These contributors to net income were offset by the overall increase in operating expenses of approximately $4.9 million.\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Fiscal Year\nEnded\nSeptember 30,\n2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>% of\nRevenues </th> <th> </th> <th>Fiscal Year\nEnded\nSeptember 30,\n2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>% of\nRevenues </th> <th> </th> <th>%\nVariance </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue from product sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>587.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>675.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue from services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>550.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>572.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,137.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,247.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe amortize these assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.

such as property, plant and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Conditions that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in customer demand or business climate that could affect the value of an asset, a product recall or an adverse action by a regulator. Recoverability of the asset or asset group is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to undiscounted future net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its respective fair value which is generally determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows or as the appraised value.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:\nRevenues from services increased $22.8 million, or 4.3%, to $550.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $527.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Service and capital system support revenues increased in the power, hydrocarbon and chemical processing end markets for approximately $6.4 million, driven by penetration into new and existing customer accounts, as well as service business growth in the Municipal Segment for approximately $4.4 million through geographical expansion and rollout of new service offerings. The consolidation of TWO, our joint venture that sells water management equipment and services, also accounted for approximately $11.6 million of the increase in service revenues.\nhandle our customers' complete water needs through on-demand water management, predictive maintenance and service response planning.

The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. We operate in numerous countries around the world and therefore, certain of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the euro, U.K. sterling, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Singapore dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. As a result, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items recorded in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in the functional currency. While we believe we are not susceptible to any material impact on our results of operations caused by fluctuations in exchange rates because our operations are primarily conducted in the United States, if we expand our foreign operations in the future, substantial increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these other currencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nended September 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by increased tax expense of $7.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to a tax benefit of $18.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, a difference of $25.8 million. Furthermore, $12.9 million of additional interest expense was incurred in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. These factors offset the increased revenue volume and profitability associated with the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson, which accounted for $11.6 million of increased net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. The increased volume and profitability as well as incremental benefits from restructuring activities and operational efficiencies that were implemented in the prior year (net of charges from additional restructuring actions taken in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017) contributed the remaining $1.3 million to net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.\n(c)Represents non-cash stock-based compensation expenses related to option awards.

The largest driver in the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF and Delta UV accounting for $9.8 million of the operating expense increase and Magneto accounting for $2.7 million of the increase.

The increase in operating profit was primarily related to an increase in volume of $9.4 million as well as $9.8 million of benefits experienced as a result of our Value Creator initiatives. Value Creator benefits include carry over benefits from operational efficiency initiatives that we implemented in the prior fiscal year.\nAs of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2017, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nAccruals for estimated expenses related to warranties are made at the time products are sold and are recorded as a component of cost of product sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The estimated warranty obligation is based on product warranty terms offered to customers, ongoing product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs expected to be incurred in correcting a product failure, as well as specific obligations for known failures and other currently available evidence. We assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities on a regular basis and adjust amounts as necessary.\nlosses and expenses. We present Adjusted EBITDA, which is not a recognized financial measure under GAAP, because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, we believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results, because it excludes the results of decisions that are outside the control of management, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance as follows:\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nManagement evaluated the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates and believes that the following involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position, and are therefore discussed as critical. The following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations. More information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in \"Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The amendments in this ASU are effective for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2020. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nEBITDA in the Municipal Segment increased $9.6 million, or 32.3%, to $39.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $29.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. EBITDA increased because of the same factors that affected operating profit in the Municipal Segment during this period, with the addition of our fleet optimization as part of our Value Creator program, converting it from an operating lease to a capital lease driving an increase of approximately $0.8 million in EBITDA.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk and prevent us from meeting our obligations. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations.\"\nIn connection with the Acquisition, we entered into the \"Senior Secured Credit Facilities,\" which originally consisted of (a) a seven-year $505.0 million senior secured first lien term loan facility (the \"Term Loan Facility\"), scheduled to mature on January 15, 2021 and a $75.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"), scheduled to mature on January 15, 2019 and (b) a seven-year $75.0 million senior secured second lien term loan facility, scheduled to mature on January 15, 2022 (which is no longer outstanding). On April 15, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our first lien credit agreement, dated as of January 15, 2014 (the \"First Lien Credit Agreement\"), to borrow an additional $185.0 million of term loans under our Term Loan Facility to fund a portion of the consideration for the Neptune-Benson Acquisition. On October 28, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the First Lien Credit Agreement to (i) borrow an additional $150.0 million of term loans under our Term Loan Facility to fund our repayment in full of our second lien facility and revolving credit loans then outstanding and (ii) increase commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by $20.0 million to a total of $95.0 million. On August 8, 2017, we entered into another amendment to the First Lien Credit Agreement pursuant to which we (i) borrowed approximately $262.7 million in refinancing term loans, the net proceeds of which were used to refinance in their entirety the loans incurred in connection with the Neptune-Benson Acquisition and (ii) increased the amount of our existing Term Loan Facility by borrowing $80.0 million of incremental term loans under the Term Loan Facility, the net proceeds of which were used to repay $60.0 million of revolving credit loans then outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and to pay related fees and expenses, and for other general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions and permitted investments pursuant to the First Lien Credit Agreement). On November 7, 2017, we used a portion of the proceeds of our initial public offering to repay approximately $104.9 million of indebtedness (including accrued and unpaid interest) under the Term Loan Facility. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities also include an uncommitted incremental facility, which, subject to certain conditions, provides for additional term loans and/or revolving loans in an aggregate amount that does not cause our first lien net leverage ratio to exceed 4.50 to 1.00 (calculated as the ratio of consolidated funded first lien debt for borrowed money (net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) to trailing four-quarter Consolidated EBITDA (as defined therein), plus an additional $100 million (excluding incremental revolving credit loans or increases in revolving credit commitments not exceeding $30.0 million) (all of which remained available as of September 30, 2017).\n$47.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was 343.0% compared to an effective tax rate of (125.6)% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in income tax expense and effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the benefit resulting from the release of valuation allowance as a result of additional deferred tax liabilities recognized in connection with the Neptune-Benson Acquisition.\nInvesting Activities\nResearch and Development Expense-Research and development expenses decreased $2.9 million, or 12.7%, to $20.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $22.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Research and development expenses increased $1.0 million with the acquisition of Magneto and their extensive research and development programs related to anode coatings, but was offset by decrease of approximately $1.5 million in research and development expenses in connection with the consolidation and restructuring of our Singaporean research and development center as well as a reduction of approximately $0.9 million associated with a restructuring program in the Municipal Segment implemented in December, 2016.. Additionally, we received reimbursements from the Singapore government for research and development credits in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 of approximately $1.3 million.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Scope of Modification Accounting, which amended Accounting Standards Code Topic 718. FASB issued ASU 2017-09 to reduce the cost and complexity when applying Topic 718 and standardize the practice of applying Topic 718 to financial reporting. The ASU was not developed to fundamentally change the definition of a modification, but instead to provide guidance for what changes would qualify as a modification. ASU No. 2017-09 will be effective for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2018. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nIndustrial\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. The ASU includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2017. We do not expect the implementation of this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues in the Industrial Segment increased $35.2 million, or 6.2%, to $604.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $569.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in revenues was primarily due to the execution of an additional $17.3 million of capital project orders compared to the prior fiscal year in the power, pulp and paper end markets. Service and capital system revenues increased in power and hydrocarbon and chemical processing end markets by $6.4 million, driven by penetration into new and existing accounts. In addition the consolidation of TWO drove a net increase in revenue of $11.6 million. This increase was partially offset by a decline in aftermarket revenue.\nThe increase in operating profit was primarily due to the continued Value Creator benefits in both project execution and ePro of $2.4 million, benefits from the alignment to a more customer focused organizational structure of $2.8 million, and reduced warranty expense of $1.3 million. This was partially offset by increased labor costs of approximately $1.8 million.\nCost of Sales, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nOur Service Model\nRetirement Benefits\nN/M-Not meaningful\nOperating profit in the Municipal Segment increased $9.2 million, or 41.3%, to $31.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $22.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating profit excluding Italy was primarily due to $2.6 million from volume, and the implementation of the Value Creator program, which delivered efficiencies in order execution and $2.8 million savings in ePro. The final stages in closure of our Italian operations improved our operating profit by $5.9 million, while operational efficiencies in both project execution and ePro noted above, and continued alignment to a more customer focused organizational structure favorably drove the results by $2.1 million. This increase was partially offset by sales investments.\n\u2022 incur liens; or\nItem 7.

We consider liquidity in terms of cash flows from operations and their sufficiency to fund our operating and investing activities.\nThese estimates are no longer necessary to determine the fair value of new awards since the underlying shares are now publicly traded. Stock options are granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than the estimated fair market value on the date of grant as authorized by our compensation committee. Options granted vest ratably at 25% per year and are exercisable at the time of vesting. Stock option grants are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting. Prior to our initial public offering, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock option awards granted. We considered the retirement and forfeiture provisions of the options and utilized our historical experience and the experience of similar public companies to estimate the expected life of the options. We based the risk-free interest rate on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury security with a maturity generally equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant. We estimated the volatility of the share price of our common stock by considering the historical volatility of the stock of similar public entities. We estimated the dividend yield to be zero as we did not intend to pay dividends in the future. In determining the appropriateness of the public entities included in the volatility assumption we considered a number of factors, including the entity's life cycle stage, growth profile, size, financial leverage and products offered. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award, net of estimated forfeitures, and is recognized as a component of general and administrative expense over the requisite vesting period.\n(1)Interest expense and Income tax expense (benefit) are corporate activities that are not allocated to our three reportable segments.\nRevenues in the Products Segment increased $36.7 million, or 16.8%, to $255.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $218.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto which accounted for $42.9 million of additional revenues. The increase was partially offset by delays in the marine and power product retrofit markets which experienced a decrease in product revenues of $14.0 million. Revenues for highly purified water in the microelectronics and power markets increased by $7.8 million with the establishment of a new legal entity and sales presence in China.\nRevenues from product sales increased $53.4 million, or 10.0%, to $587.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $533.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in revenues was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, ETS and Magneto. These acquisitions accounted for $44.4 million of the increase in product revenues. Other areas of product revenue growth included an increase in the execution of capital project orders of approximately $17.3 million as compared to the prior year in the power and pulp and paper end markets, as well as an increase of approximately $7.8 million for products related to highly purified water in the microelectronics and power markets with the establishment of a new legal entity and sales presence in the China market. This increase was partially offset by delays in the marine and power product retrofit markets, which experienced a decrease in product revenues of approximately $14.0 million.\nBusiness Segments\nGross profit is determined by subtracting cost of product sales and cost of services from our product and services revenue. Gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our combined product and services revenue.\nUse of Estimates\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $10.0 million to $31.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $41.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the following:\n\nRevenues-Revenues increased $76.2 million, or 7.2%, to $1,137.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $1,061.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.\n\u2022Olson-On June 30, 2017, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of privately held Olson Irrigation Systems (\"Olson\"), a leading designer and producer of filters and irrigation components for the agriculture and industrial markets, for $9.4 million. Olson is included in the results of our Products Segment.\n\nWe maintain a leading position among customers in growing industries that utilize water as a critical part of their operations or production processes, including pharmaceuticals and health sciences, microelectronics, food and beverage, hydrocarbon and chemical processing, power, general manufacturing, municipal drinking and wastewater, marine and aquatics. Water treatment is an essential, non-discretionary market that is growing in importance as access to clean water has become an international priority. Underpinning this growth are a number of global, long-term trends that have resulted in increasingly stringent effluent regulations, along with a growing demand for cleaner and sustainable waste streams for reuse. These trends include the growing global population, increasing levels of urbanization and continued global economic growth, and we have seen these trends manifest themselves within our various end markets creating multiple avenues of growth. For example, within the industrial market, water is an integral and meaningful component in the production of a wide-range of goods spanning from consumer electronics to automobiles.\n\u2022 sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\nEBITDA in the Products Segment increased $15.9 million, or 40.5%, to $55.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $39.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in EBITDA was primarily due to the Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto acquisitions.\n\nProducts\nWhile we do not believe it to be significant, our business does exhibit seasonality resulting from our customers' increasing demand for our products and services during the spring and summer months as compared to the fall and winter months. For example, our Municipal Segment experiences increased demand for our odor control product lines and services in the warmer months which, together with other factors, typically results in improved performance in the second half of our fiscal year. Inclement weather, such as hurricanes, droughts and floods, can also drive increased demand for our products and services. As a result, our results from operations may vary from period to period.\n\u2022Noble-On May 9, 2017, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Noble Water Technologies, Inc. (\"Noble\"), which provides water equipment and treatment systems for commercial buildings, industrial plants, medical laboratories and the pharmaceutical industry, with a focus on the Texas market, for $7.6 million, consisting of $5.9 million cash paid at closing and $1.7 million related to a $2.4 million maximum earnout payment subject to various performance metrics measured at the end of the 12 month period following closing. Noble supports our existing high-purity water capabilities and is based in Dallas, Texas. Noble is included in the results of our Industrial Segment.\n(ii)legal settlement costs and intellectual property related fees associated with legacy matters prior to the Acquisition, including fees and settlement costs related to product warranty litigation on MEMCOR products and certain discontinued products ($11.7 million in fiscal 2015, reflected as components of Cost of product sales and services ($10.7 million) and General and administrative expenses ($1.0 million), $5.1 million, primarily reflected as a component of Cost of product sales and services in fiscal 2016 and $2.5 million, primarily reflected as components of Cost of product sales and services ($0.4 million) and General and administrative expenses ($2.1 million) in fiscal 2017);\nEquity-based Compensation\n\u2022 to make budgeting decisions; and\n\u2022 agree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries;\nProduct Warranties\nSeasonality\nOur vision \"to be the world's first choice in water solutions\" and our values of \"integrity, customers and performance\" foster a corporate culture that is focused on employee enablement, empowerment and accountability, which creates a highly entrepreneurial and dynamic work environment. Our purpose is \"Transforming water. Enriching life.\" We draw from a long legacy of water treatment innovations and industry firsts, supported by more than 1,250 granted or pending patents, which in aggregate are important to our business. Our core technologies are primarily focused on removing impurities from water, rather than neutralizing them through the addition of chemicals, and we are able to achieve purification levels which are 1,000 times greater than typical drinking water.\n(iii)foreign exchange impact related to headquarter allocations ($0.7 million gain in fiscal 2016, and $1.2 million loss in fiscal 2017); and\n\n\u2022 the market performance and financial results of comparable publicly-traded companies;\nFiscal Years Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2017\n\u2022 Within the Products Segment, we provide a highly differentiated and scalable range of products and technologies specified by global water treatment designers, OEMs, engineering firms and integrators.\n\u2022 designate any of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and marketing promotions of our products, services and solutions and related personnel expenses (including all Evoqua sales and application employees' base compensation and incentives), as well as sponsorship costs, consulting and contractor expenses, travel, display expenses and related amortization. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to actively promote our products, services and solutions.\n(i)impact of foreign exchange gains and losses ($19.0 million loss in fiscal 2015, $0.5 million loss in fiscal 2016 and $7.8 million gain in fiscal 2017);\nOur ability to source and distribute products effectively. Our revenues are affected by our ability to purchase our inputs in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. While we believe our suppliers have adequate capacity to meet our current and anticipated demand, our level of revenues could be adversely affected in the event of constraints in our supply chain, including the inability of our suppliers to produce sufficient quantities of raw materials in a manner that is able to match demand from our customers.\n\u2022 Accrued expenses and other liabilities used $31.4 million in operating cash flows in fiscal 2016 compared to $14.6 million used in fiscal 2015. This increased use of operational cash flow resulted primarily from the timing of cash payments for various employee-related and other restructuring activities during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $76.9 million from $191.4 million of net cash provided by financing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 to net cash provided by financing activities of $114.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. This lower amount of cash provided by financing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 was primarily due to higher payment of debt. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we refinanced $75.0 million of our second lien facilities into our first lien facilities. In addition, we continued to repay debt in accordance with each applicable credit agreement's terms, including repayment of amounts borrowed from the Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, we paid increased dividends to the noncontrolling interest, offset by a reduction in proceeds from both capital contributions and common stock issuances.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense-General and administrative expenses decreased $2.9 million, or 2.0%, to $144.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $147.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto accounted for a $11.7 million increase in general and administrative expenses, which was offset by a $14.6 million decrease in general and administrative expenses as a result of restructuring actions and other cost savings initiatives taken across the business.\n\u2022 pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock;\nNet Income-Net income decreased by $6.6 million, or 50.8%, to net income of $6.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to net income of $13.0 million for the fiscal year\nInterest Expense-Interest expense increased $8.4 million, or 24.8%, to $42.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $34.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense is due to an increase in borrowing for acquisitions, interest on capital leases and fees associated with our senior secured credit facilities.\nMunicipal\n\u2022 industry or company-specific considerations;\nRevenue\nAdjusted EBITDA-Adjusted EBITDA increased $40.2 million, or 33.5%, to $160.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $119.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Increased volume and carry over benefits from restructuring and operational efficiencies that we implemented in the prior year provided $17.1 million of the increase in Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, revenue volume and profitability associated with the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto contributed approximately $15.9 million of the increase in Adjusted EBITDA, while the final stages in closure of our Italian operations improved our profitability by $5.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\nRevenues in the Industrial Segment increased $39.2 million, or 6.5%, to $643.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $604.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in service revenues of $27.7 million driven by higher customer production levels in general manufacturing and pharmaceutical and healthcare end markets and new account penetration in power and hydrocarbon and chemical processing end markets. In addition, an increase of $19.4 million of revenue was attributable to our acquisitions of ETS, ADI and Noble during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. Our increased revenues were partially offset by a decrease of $7.9 million in revenues related to the Vernon Disposition as of September 30, 2016.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and require management to make estimates and assumptions. These assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are used for, but not limited to: (i) revenue recognition; (ii) allowance for doubtful accounts; (iii) inventory valuation, asset valuations, impairment and recoverability assessments; (iv) depreciable lives of assets; (v) useful lives of intangible assets; (vi) income tax reserves and valuation allowances and (vii) product warranty and litigation reserves. Estimates are revised as additional information becomes available. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n(1)We hold a 50% partnership interest in TWO, which, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015, we accounted for under the equity method and did not consolidate, as we did not have a controlling financial interest based on the shared powers of both joint venture partners to direct the activities that most significantly impact TWO's financial performance. On October 1, 2015, a change occurred in the partnership structure of TWO such that we are now obligated to absorb all risk of loss up to 100% of the joint venture partner's equity. As such, the accounting for our 50% interest changed from equity method investment to full consolidation as a variable interest entity under ASC 810.\nand, if expectations differ from previous estimates, adjusted accordingly. Estimated useful lives for major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:\nSegment Results\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments on an on-going basis.\nWe develop our technologies through in-house research, development and engineering and targeted tuck-in, technology-enhancing and geography-expanding acquisitions. We have a reservoir of recently launched technologies and a strong pipeline of new offerings designed to provide customers with innovative, value-enhancing solutions. Furthermore, we have successfully completed eight technology-enhancing and geography-expanding acquisitions since April 2016 to add new capabilities and cross-selling opportunities in areas such as electrochemical and electrochlorination cells, regenerative media filtration, anodes, UV disinfection and aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment technologies. We are able to rapidly scale new technologies using our leading direct and third-party sales channels and our relationships with key influencers, including municipal representatives, engineering firms, designers and other system specifiers. We believe our continued investment in driving penetration of our recently launched technologies, robust pipeline of new capabilities and best-in-class channels to market will allow us to continue to address our customer needs across the water lifecycle.\n\u2022 likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a sale of the company;\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses increased $29.2 million, or 9.6%, to $332.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $302.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\nN/M-Not meaningful\nRevenues from services increased $22.3 million, or 4.1%, to $572.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $550.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase was driven mainly by organic revenue growth, including volume driven increases in Industrial service revenue of approximately $27.7 million associated with higher U.S. customer production levels in the general manufacturing and pharmaceutical and healthcare end markets and new account penetration in the power and hydrocarbon and chemical processing end markets, and an increase of approximately $2.4 million related to our Municipal services business. These increases were offset by approximately $7.9 million in revenues related to our Vernon location in the year ended September 30, 2016 that did not reoccur because of the Vernon Disposition as of September 30, 2016.\nNet income (loss) is determined by subtracting operating expenses and interest expense from, and adding other operating income (expense), equity income from our partnership interest in TWO and income tax benefit (expense) to, gross profit. For more information on how we determine gross profit, see \"-Gross Profit.\"\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to invest in developing new products, services and solutions and enhancing our existing products, services and solutions.\n\u2022 The aggregate of non-current assets and non-current liabilities provided $16.0 million in operating cash flows in fiscal 2016 compared to $3.2 million used in fiscal 2015. The cash flows related to this increase in fiscal 2016 include an increase in pension liabilities of $8.1 million compared to a decrease of pension liability of $0.3 million in fiscal 2015, driven by declines in discount rates used to value projected benefit obligations. Additionally, $8.8 million of long term capital leases were entered into in fiscal 2016.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties that are under Common Control. The ASU changes how a single decision maker of a VIE that holds indirect interest in the entity through related parties that are under common control determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The new guidance amends ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, issued in February 2015. The guidance should be applied coincidentally with the adoption of ASU 2015-02, which was effective for us for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $297.7 million from $46.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 to $344.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune Benson, Magneto, VAF and Delta UV, which were consummated during fiscal 2016 with a total cash outlay of $306.4 million. This cash outlay on acquisitions was offset, in part, by proceeds of $4.5 million from the Vernon Disposition, and $5.2 million on the sale of vacant facilities.\nEBITDA in the Municipal Segment increased $5.3 million, or 13.5%, to $44.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $39.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. EBITDA increased as a result of the same factors which impacted operating profit in the Municipal Segment during this period.\nWe expect to continue to finance our liquidity requirements through internally generated funds and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that our projected cash flows generated\n\u2022 to assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance;\n\u2022 The aggregate of prepaid expense and other assets and other non current assets and liabilities used $6.6 million in operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 compared to $17.3 million provided in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The use of operational cash flow in the period ended September 30, 2017 was primarily related to the reduction of a long term lease receivable in addition and increase in the lease liability offset by a change in pension liability.\n\u2022ETS-On November 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Environmental Treatment Systems Inc. (\"ETS\"), which adds organic wastewater treatment capability to our industrial treatment solutions, for $10.7 million. ETS further allows us to insource manufacturing of dissolved air flotation units, the production of which we previously outsourced. ETS is included in the results of our Industrial Segment.\n\u2022 The aggregate of receivables, inventories, cost and earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts, accounts payable and billings in excess of costs incurred on uncompleted contracts used $61.3 million in operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 compared to $10.1 million in operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the above mentioned accounts depends upon how effectively we manage our cash conversion cycle, which is a representation of the number of days that elapse from the date of purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from customers. Our cash conversion cycle can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period. Further, as it relates to capital projects, fiscal 2017 represented a continued rebuilding of the pipeline of capital projects as compared to the period prior to the Acquisition, which represented a depletion of the pipeline of capital projects. This build-up of capital project activity contributed to the variability of accounts receivable, inventories, excess billings on uncompleted contracts or billings in excess of costs incurred on uncompleted contracts from period to period.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires recognition of operating leases as lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 will be effective retrospectively for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table provides the change in revenues from product sales and revenues from services, respectively:\n\ntiming. This revenue growth was also partially offset by a decline of $4.1 million in revenues due to the final stages in closure of our Italian operations.\nThe following table provides the change in revenues from product sales and revenues from services, respectively:\n\nSales and Marketing Expense-Sales and marketing expenses increased $7.2 million, or 5.3%, to $142.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $135.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The driving factor in the increase in sales and marketing expense was an increase of $10.9 million associated with the sales and marketing activities of the acquired companies of Neptune Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson. This increase was offset by a decrease in the bad debt reserve of $2.5 million related to aligning our bad debt reserve in addition to recovering a receivable that had been previously written off.\nAvailability of water. In general, we expect demand for our products and services to increase as the availability of clean water from public sources decreases. Secular trends that will drive demand for water across a multitude of industrial, commercial and municipal applications include global population growth, urbanization, industrialization and overall economic growth. In addition, the supply of clean water could be adversely impacted by factors including an aging water infrastructure within North\n\u2022Delta UV-On August 3, 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Delta Ultraviolet Corporation (\"Delta UV\"), a leading manufacturer and marketer of UV-C technology in North America for $4.8 million. Delta UV is included in the results of our Products Segment.\n\u2022 to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies;\nOperating Activities\nOur business is organized by customer base and offerings into three reportable segments that each draw from the same reservoir of leading technologies, shared manufacturing infrastructure, common business processes and corporate philosophies. Our reportable segments consist of: (i) our Industrial Segment, (ii) our Municipal Segment and (iii) our Products Segment. The key factors used to identify these reportable segments are the organization and alignment of our internal operations, the nature of the products and services and customer type.\nCost of product sales increased by approximately $22.2 million in the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cost of sales for our products business was primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto. These acquisitions accounted for $21.2 million of the increase in cost of sales as well as a corresponding gross profit increase of approximately $23.2 million and were the primary driver of the 2.8% increase in gross margin. Increases in revenues related to capital project orders and sales in the\nWe account for awards of equity instruments in accordance with relevant authoritative literature. Prior to our initial public offering, given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, the fair value of the common stock underlying our share-based awards was determined by our board, with input from management, in each case using the income and market valuation approach. We believe that our board had the relevant experience and expertise to determine the fair value of our common stock. In accordance with the Accounting and Valuation Guide: Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, our board exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock including:\nOur Existing Customer Base\nCost of services increased by approximately $5.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in cost of services was related to an overall increase in revenue volume, offset by the benefits of cost efficiencies implemented as well as $7.6 million related to the cost of services attributable to the Vernon Disposition as of September 30, 2016.\nNew products and technologies. Our ability to maintain our appeal to existing customers and attract new customers depends on our ability to originate, develop and offer a compelling array of products, services and solutions responsive to evolving customer innovations, preferences and specifications. We expect that increased use of water in industrial and commercial processes will drive increased customer demand in the future, and our ability to grow will depend in part on effectively responding to innovation in our customers' processes and systems. Further, our ability to provide products that comply with evolving government regulations will also be a driver of the appeal of our products, services and solutions to industrial and commercial customers.\nInflation and deflation trends. Our financial results can be expected to be directly impacted by substantial increases in costs due to commodity cost increases or general inflation which could lead to a reduction in our revenues as well as greater margin pressure as increased costs may not be able to be passed on to customers. To date, changes in commodity prices and general inflation have not materially impacted our business.\nCost of product sales increased by approximately $38.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in cost of product sales was primarily driven by the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson, which accounted for $32.5 million. These accretive acquisitions were the primary driver of the increase of 330 basis points in gross margin percentage. The remaining increase in cost of product sales was due to organic growth driven by higher sales volumes due to increased U.S customer production levels in the general manufacturing and pharmaceutical and healthcare end markets and the power and microelectronics markets in the Asian region. These increases in cost of product sales were partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million related to the wind down of our Italian operations.\nFinancing Activities\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, where cost is generally determined on the basis of an average or first-in, first-out method. Production costs comprise direct material and labor and applicable manufacturing overheads, including depreciation charges. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write off excess or obsolete inventory based on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements. Manufacturing operations recognize cost of product sales using standard costing rates with overhead absorption which generally approximates actual cost.\n\u2022 our historical and projected operating and financial results, including capital expenditures;\nFor sales of aftermarket parts or products with a low level of customization and engineering time, we recognize revenues at the time title and risks and rewards of ownership pass, which is generally when products are shipped or delivered to the customer as we have no obligation for installation. Sales\nCash Flows\n(e)Represents expenses associated with acquisition and divestiture-related activities and post-acquisition integration costs and accounting, tax, consulting, legal and other fees and expenses associated with acquisition transactions ($5.4 million in fiscal 2016 and $7.3 million in fiscal 2017).\nThe following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated:\n\u2022 consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n(b)Represents adjustments for the effect of the purchase accounting step-up in the value of inventory to fair value recognized in cost of goods sold as a result of the Acquisition and the acquisition of Magneto.\n(1)For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to net income (loss), its most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, see \"-How We Assess the Performance of Our Business-Adjusted EBITDA.\"\nIndustrial\nOur sales are a function of sales volumes and selling prices, each of which is a function of the mix of product and service sales, and consist primarily of:\nEBITDA in the Products Segment increased $22.3 million, or 40.5%, to $77.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $55.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, with $15.6 million attributable to the Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto and Olson. The balance of $6.7 million was due to growth in the other product lines and reduced operating expenses from restructuring in the prior period.\nIn addition to the above, our chief operating decision maker uses EBITDA of each reportable segment to evaluate the operating performance of such segments.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nAmerica and increased levels of water stress from seasonal rainfall, inadequate water storage options or treatment technologies. Because water is a critical component and byproduct of many processes, including in manufacturing and product development, we expect that, as global consumption patterns evolve and water shortages persist, demand for our equipment and services will continue to increase.\n\u2022 in certain calculations under our senior secured credit facilities, which use components of Adjusted EBITDA.\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key indicators of the financial condition and operating performance of our business are revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA.\n\u2022 enter into transactions with our affiliates;\n(iv)costs incurred by us in connection with the initial public offering, including consultant costs and public company compliance costs ($0.5 million in fiscal 2016, reflected as a component of General and administrative expense and $8.3 million in fiscal 2017, reflected as a component of General and administrative expense).\n\n(1)We hold a 50% partnership interest in TWO, which, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015, we accounted for under the equity method and did not consolidate, as we did not have a controlling financial interest based on the shared powers of both joint venture partners to direct the activities that most significantly impact TWO's financial performance. On October 1, 2015, a change occurred in the partnership structure of TWO such that we are now obligated to absorb all risk of loss up to 100% of the joint venture partner's equity. As such, the accounting for our 50% interest changed from equity method investment to full consolidation as a variable interest entity under ASC 810.\nThe following table provides the change in cost of product sales and cost of services, respectively, along with related gross margins:\nAdjusted EBITDA is one of the primary metrics used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax benefit (expense) and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain other items, including restructuring and related business transformation costs, purchase accounting adjustment costs, non-cash stock-based compensation, sponsor fees, transaction costs and other gains,\n\u2022 amounts of indebtedness;\nProperty, plant, and equipment is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. If the costs of certain components of an item of property, plant, and equipment are significant in relation to the total cost of the item, they are accounted for and depreciated separately. Depreciation expense is recognized using the straight-line method. Useful lives are reviewed annually\nFluctuation in quarterly results. Our quarterly results have historically varied depending upon a variety of factors, including funding, readiness of projects and regulatory approvals. In addition, our contracts for large capital water treatment projects, systems and solutions for industrial, commercial and municipal applications are generally fixed-price contracts with milestone billings. As a result of these factors, our working capital requirements and demands on our distribution and delivery network may fluctuate during the year.\nInterest Expense-Interest expense increased $12.9 million, or 30.2%, to $55.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $42.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in borrowing in support of acquisitions, interest on capital leases and fees associated with our senior secured credit facilities.\nWe selectively target high value projects with opportunities for recurring business through service, parts and other aftermarket opportunities over the lifecycle of the process or capital equipment. In particular, we have developed a pipeline of smart, internet-connected monitoring technologies through the deployment of our Water One smart water platform that provides us with an increasing ability to\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of covenants imposing certain restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. The restrictions these covenants place on our business operations, include limitations on our or our subsidiaries' ability to:\nOther Operating Income, Net-Other operating income increased $6.9 million to $7.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $0.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in other operating income was primarily due to a gain on disposal of assets, including the Vernon Disposition.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider it appropriate for supplemental analysis. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.\nOperating expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing, general and administrative and research and development expenses.\n\nOur solutions are designed to provide \"worry-free water\" by ensuring that our customers have access to an uninterrupted quantity and level of quality of water that meets their unique product, process and recycle or reuse specifications. We enable our customers to achieve lower costs through greater uptime, throughput and efficiency in their operations and support their regulatory compliance and environmental sustainability. We have worked to protect water, the environment and our employees for over 100 years. As a result, we have earned a reputation for quality, safety and reliability and are sought out by our customers to solve the full range of their water treatment needs, and maintaining our reputation is critical to the success of our business and solution set.\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the term of the lease. Costs related to maintenance and repairs that do not extend the assets' useful life are expensed as incurred.\nAs of September 30, 2017, we had total indebtedness of $906.8 million, including $896.6 million of borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, no borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and $10.2 million in borrowings related to a BOO financing. We also had $6.7 million of letters of credit issued under our $95.0 million Revolving Credit Facility and an additional $10.6 million of letters of credit issued under a separate uncommitted facility as of September 30, 2017.\n\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for restructuring activities and other items impact reported cash flows.\n\u2022VAF-On July 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Valve and Filtration Systems, Ltd. (\"VAF\") for approximately $3.3 million, consisting of $2.7 million cash at closing and $0.6 million related to a $1.0 million maximum earnout payment subject to various performance metrics over the next five years. VAF is a leading screen filtration manufacturer based in Arvada, Colorado. VAF is included in the results of our Products Segment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview and Background\nWe apply ASC Topic 715, Compensation-Retirement Benefits, which requires the recognition in pension obligations and accumulated other comprehensive income of actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations that have previously been deferred. The determination of retirement benefit pension obligations and associated costs requires the use of actuarial computations to estimate participant plan benefits to which the employees will be entitled. The significant assumptions primarily relate to discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, mortality, years of service and other factors. We develop each assumption using relevant experience in conjunction with market-related data for each individual country in which such plans exist. All actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually with third-party consultants and adjusted as necessary. For the recognition of net periodic postretirement cost, the calculation of the expected return on plan assets is generally derived by applying the expected long-term rate of return on the market-related value of plan assets. The fair value of plan assets is determined based on actual market prices or estimated fair value at the measurement date.\nRevenues-Revenues increased $110.2 million, or 9.7%, to $1,247.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $1,137.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\nVarious trends and other factors affect or have affected our operating results, including:\nRevenues in the Municipal Segment increased slightly by $0.6 million, or 0.2%, to $278.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $278.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Excluding the operations in Italy, which we are in the process of closing and resulted in a decline of $1.6 million over the same period, the overall business grew by $2.2 million, or 0.8%. Excluding Italy, the aftermarket and services revenues are up 3.3% and 2.5% respectively, while capital revenues declined by 1.6%. Timing in capital was offset by growth in both the Municipal Services and wastewater and MEMCOR aftermarket revenues as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015, 2016 and 2017, our Industrial Segment accounted for 53.6%, 53.1% and 51.6% of our revenues, respectively; our Municipal Segment accounted for 25.8%, 24.4% and 22.3% of our revenues, respectively; and our Products Segment accounted for 20.6%, 22.5% and 26.1% of revenues, respectively.\n(a)We occupy certain facilities and operate certain equipment and vehicles under non-cancelable lease arrangements. Lease agreements may contain lease escalation clauses and purchase and renewal options. We recognize scheduled lease escalation clauses over the course of the applicable lease term on a straight-line basis.\nResearch and Development Expense-Research and development expenses decreased $3.0 million, or 11.6%, to $22.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $25.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Research and development expenses increased $0.2 million with the acquisition of Magneto and their extensive research and development programs related to anode coatings.\n\nWe believe that continuous improvement of our operations, processes and organizational structure is a key driver of our earnings growth. Since fiscal 2014, we have realigned our organizational structure, achieved significant cost savings through operational efficiencies and revitalized our culture, which has energized our workforce and reduced employee turnover. We have identified and are pursuing a number of discrete initiatives which, if successful, we expect could result in additional cost savings over the next three years. These initiatives include our ePro and supply chain improvement programs to consolidate and manage global spending, our improved logistics and transportation management program, further optimizing our engineering cost structure, capturing benefits of our Water One remote system monitoring and data analytics offerings. We refer to these initiatives as \"Value Creators\" as these improvements focus on creating value for customers through reduced leadtimes, improved quality and superior customer support, while also creating value for stockholders through enhanced earnings growth. Furthermore, as a result of significant investments we have made in our footprint and facilities, we have capacity to support our planned growth without commensurate increase in fixed costs.\nGovernment policies. Decaying water systems in the United States will require critical drinking water and wastewater repairs, often led by municipal governments. Further, as U.S. states increase regulation on existing and emerging contaminants, we expect that our customers will increasingly require sustainable solutions to their water-related needs. In general, increased infrastructure investment and more stringent municipal, state and federal regulations promote increased spending on our products, services and solutions, while a slowdown in investment in public infrastructure or the elimination of key environmental regulations could result in lower industrial and municipal spending on water systems and products.\nOther Operating Income (Expense), Net-Other operating income decreased $5.5 million, or 78.5%, to $1.5 million of income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $7.0 million of income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we sold two locations, which resulted in a gain on sale. There were no similar transactions in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.\n\u2022 Accrued expenses and other liabilities used $2.2 million in operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 compared to a use of $31.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The use of operational cash flow in both periods resulted primarily from capital lease activity and timing of cash payments for various employee-related liabilities.\nFor certain arrangements where there is significant customization to the product, we recognize revenue under the provisions of ASC 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. These products include large capital water treatment projects, systems and solutions for municipal and industrial applications. Revenues from construction-type contracts are generally recognized under the percentage-of-completion method, based on the input of costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated contract costs. The nature of the contracts are generally fixed price with milestone billings. Approximately $203.1 million, $218.6 million and $240.2 million of revenues from construction-type contracts were recognized on the percentage-of-completion method during the periods ending September 30, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly at a minimum and the cumulative effect of such adjustments are recognized in current operations. The amounts of such adjustments have not been material.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)-Income tax expense decreased $66.3 million, or 138.4%, to an income tax benefit of $18.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from an expense of\nGeneral and Administrative Expense-General and administrative expenses increased $24.8 million, or 17.2%, to $169.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $144.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. This increase in general and administrative expenses was partially due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson, which accounted for $7.4 million of the increase. The balance of the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to costs associated with the Company's strategic transaction process of $8.1 million, costs related to restructuring and the integration of acquisitions of $3.9 million and expenses incurred related to other various strategic projects or initiatives of approximately $2.2 million.\nmaterials and components to the collection of cash from customers. Our cash conversion cycle can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period. Further, as it relates to capital projects, fiscal 2016 represented a continued rebuilding of the pipeline of capital projects as compared to the period prior to the Acquisition, which represented a depletion of the pipeline of capital projects. This build-up of capital project activity contributed to the variability of accounts receivable, inventories, excess billings on uncompleted contracts or billings in excess of costs incurred on uncompleted contracts from period to period.\nOverall economic trends. The overall economic environment and related changes in industrial, commercial and municipal spending impact our business. In general, positive conditions in the broader economy promote industrial, commercial and municipal customer spending, while economic weakness results in a reduction of new industrial, commercial and municipal project activity. Macroeconomic factors that can affect customer spending patterns, and thereby our results of operations, include population growth, total water consumption, municipal budgets, employment rates, business conditions, the availability of credit or capital, interest rates, tax rates and regulatory changes. Since the businesses of our customers vary in cyclicality, periodic downturns in any specific sector typically have modest impacts on our overall business.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses related to research and development, patents, sustaining engineering, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials and overhead costs allocated to such expenses. Substantially all of our research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving our existing products and services. To date, research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred, because the period between achieving technological feasibility and the release of products and services for sale has been short and development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.\n\nWe are a leading provider of mission critical water treatment solutions, offering services, systems and technologies to support our customers' full water lifecycle needs. With over 200,000 installations worldwide, we hold leading positions in the industrial, commercial and municipal water treatment markets in North America. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of differentiated, proprietary technology solutions sold under a number of market-leading and well-established brands. We deliver and maintain these mission critical solutions through the largest service network in North America assuring our customers continuous uptime with 86 branches which are located no further than a two-hour drive from more than 90% of our customers' sites. We believe that the customer intimacy created through our service network is a significant competitive advantage.\nEBITDA in the Industrial Segment increased $12.8 million, or 10.9%, to $129.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $116.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in EBITDA was primarily a result of the same factors which impacted operating profit in the Industrial Segment during this period. In addition, our ePro initiatives included a program to optimize fleet vehicles. This program resulted in a reduction to the fleet size, upgrades to vehicles to improve service technician productivity and conversion of the relevant contract from an operating lease to a capital lease resulting in a total increase to EBITDA of $6.8 million. These benefits were partially offset by the same factors affecting operating profit during this period.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6, \"Selected Financial and Operating Data\" and Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts in this section are referred to in thousands.\nThe increase in operating expense was primarily due to expenses associated with the acquired companies of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson, which accounted for $18.4 million of the operating expense increase. A discussion of operating expenses by category is as follows:\nEBITDA in the Industrial Segment increased $19.8 million, or 15.3%, to $149.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $129.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in EBITDA resulted from the same factors which impacted operating profit in the Industrial Segment during this period.\nKey Factors and Trends Affecting Our Business and Financial Statements\nResults of Operations\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin-Total gross margin increased to 29.3% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from 27.6% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.\n\u2022 current business conditions and performance, including dispositions and discontinued operations;\nFiscal Years Ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016\nWe are a holding company and do not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock, if any, is dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our operating subsidiaries. Under the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, our operating subsidiaries are currently limited in their ability to pay cash dividends to us, and we expect these limitations to continue in the future under the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities of ours or of our subsidiaries.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue when an entity either enters into a contract with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into a contract for the transfer of non-financial assets. ASU 2014-09 may be adopted using either of two acceptable methods: (1) retrospective adoption to each prior period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients; or (2) adoption with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain disclosures. To assess at which time revenue should be recognized, an entity should use the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The standard is effective for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2018. At this time, we are not yet able to estimate the anticipated impact to our consolidated financial statements. We are also evaluating the new disclosures required by the standard to determine what additional information will need to be disclosed.\nAdjusted EBITDA-Adjusted EBITDA increased $47.6 million, or 29.7%, to $207.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $160.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Increased volume and benefits from restructuring and operational efficiencies that we implemented in the current and prior fiscal year provided $27.0 million of the increase in Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, revenue volume and profitability associated with prior year and current year acquisitions contributed approximately $20.6 million of the increase in Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is deemed more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within a reasonable time period. We assess tax positions using a two-step process. A tax position is recognized if it meets a more-likely-than-not threshold, and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% of being realized. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed each balance sheet date.\nSegment Results\nThe following table provides the change in cost of product sales and cost of services, respectively, along with related gross margins:\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $209.7 million from $344.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 to $134.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was largely driven by a reduction in the size of acquisitions completed during comparable periods. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 we spent $306.4 million to acquire Magneto, Neptune Benson, VAF and Delta. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we spent $77.8 million to acquire ETS, Noble, Olson and ADI. The reduction was partially offset by increased purchases of intangible assets and a sale of business that took place in the prior year.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of fixed overhead personnel expenses associated with our service organization (including district and branch managers, customer service, contract renewals and regeneration plant management). We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase due to the anticipated growth of our business and related infrastructure as well as legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations and other costs associated with becoming a public company.\n\u2022 Within the Municipal Segment, we primarily deliver solutions, equipment and services to engineering firms, OEMs and municipalities to treat wastewater and purify drinking water, and to control odor and corrosion.\nWe believe that tuck-in acquisitions present a key opportunity within our overall growth strategy, which we will continue to evaluate strategically. These strategic acquisitions will enable us to accelerate our growth in our current addressable market, as well as in new geographies and new end market verticals. Our existing customer relationships, best-in-class channels to market and ability to rapidly commercialize technologies provide a strong platform to drive rapid growth in the businesses we acquire. To capitalize on these opportunities, we have built an experienced team dedicated to mergers and acquisitions that has successfully completed eight technology-enhancing and geography-expanding acquisitions since April 2016, with purchase prices ranging from approximately $3.3 million to approximately $283.7 million, and pre-acquisition revenues ranging from approximately $3.1 million to approximately $55.7 million. We will continue to actively evaluate acquisition opportunities that are\n(iii)expenses associated with our information technology and functional infrastructure transformation following the Acquisition, including activities to optimize information technology systems and functional infrastructure processes for a standalone business ($12.1 million, primarily reflected as components of Cost of product sales and services ($3.0 million), Research and development expense ($0.4 million), Sales and marketing expense ($0.3 million) and General and administrative expense ($8.4 million) in fiscal 2015, $9.5 million, primarily reflected as components of Cost of product sales and services ($3.6 million), Sales and marketing expense ($2.5 million), General and administrative expense ($3.1 million) and Research and development expense ($0.3 million) in fiscal 2016 and $7.3 million, primarily reflected as components of Cost of product sales and services ($3.3 million), Sales and marketing expense ($1.5 million), and General and administrative expense ($2.5 million) in fiscal 2017); and\nManagement bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $197.7 million from $6.3 million of net cash used in financing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 to net cash provided by financing activities of $191.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily due to issuance of debt of $185.0 million under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities proceeds from capital contributions and issuance of common stock of approximately $17.2 million, both in support of acquisition activities.\nWe enter into long-term obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily debt obligations and non-cancelable operating leases. As of September 30, 2017, our contractual cash obligations over the next several periods were as follows (in thousands):\nmarkets in the Asia region driven by product sales of electrodeionization equipment, $3.8 million from the Wallace and Tiernan business, $3.7 million from capital sales in the separation technologies product line, and $3.4 million from stronger sales of aquatic filters in the Americas region. The Municipal aftermarket business increased by $1.8 million predominantly in North America through both wastewater and MEMCOR. These revenue increases were offset by lower sales volumes in capital projects driving a decline of $2.0 million in revenues related to large project timing in both North America & United Kingdom, and $1.6 million of revenue decline related to our Italian operations in the year ended September 30, 2016 that did not reoccur due to the wind down of our operations in that geographic area.\n\n(b)We lease certain equipment classified as capital leases. The leased equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis over the life of the lease and is included in depreciation expense.\nOperating profit in the Products Segment increased $11.2 million, or 29.8%, to $48.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $37.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to the Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto acquisitions. The declines in operating profit in the electrochlorination, dewatering and intake product lines were offset by increases in the IonPure product line with our expansion in China.\nof short-term service arrangements are recognized as the services are performed, and sales of long-term service arrangements are typically recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreement.\nRevenue Recognition\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased to $28.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $31.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\n(d)Represents management fees paid to AEA pursuant to the management agreement. Pursuant to the management agreement, AEA provided advisory and consulting services to us in connection with the Acquisition, including investment banking, due diligence, financial advisory and valuation services. AEA also provided ongoing advisory and consulting services (similar in nature to the services provided in connection with the Acquisition) to us pursuant to the management agreement. In connection with the initial public offering, the management agreement was terminated. See Item 13, \"Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence\" and Note 18, \"Related-Party Transactions\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail.\n(i)costs and expenses in connection with various restructuring initiatives since the Acquisition, including severance costs, relocation costs, recruiting expenses, write-offs of inventory and fixed assets and third-party consultant costs to assist with these initiatives (includes (A) $16.9 million in fiscal 2016 (all of which is reflected as a component of Restructuring charges in Note 12, \"Restructuring and Related Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and $20.1 million in fiscal 2017 (all of which is reflected as a component of Restructuring charges in Note 12, \"Restructuring and Related Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) related to our voluntary separation plan pursuant to which approximately 220 employees accepted separation packages, and (B) $9.2 million (of which $6.5 million is reflected as a component of Restructuring charges in Note 12, \"Restructuring and Related Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) in fiscal 2015, $11.1 million (all of which is reflected as a component of Restructuring charges in Note 12, \"Restructuring and Related Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) in fiscal 2016 and $13.2 million (of which $12.3 million is reflected as a component of Restructuring charges in Note 12, \"Restructuring and Related Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) in fiscal 2017 related to various other initiatives implemented to restructure and reorganize our business with the appropriate management team and cost structure). Differences between amounts reflected as Restructuring charges in Note 12, \"Restructuring and Related Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and amounts reflected in this adjustment also relate to retention payments made to employees in fiscal 2015 of $2.5 million that have been reflected as components of Cost of product sales and services ($1.1 million), Research and development expense ($0.1 million), Sales and marketing expense ($1.0 million) and General and administrative expense ($0.3 million). Differences between amounts reflected as Restructuring charges in Note 12, \"Restructuring and Related Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 and amounts reflected in this adjustment relate primarily to impairment charges related to assets in our Italy operations that have been reflected as a component of Cost of product sales and services ($0.9 million);\n\u2022 lack of marketability of our common stock; and\nAcquisitions\nThe following table summarizes the changes to our cash flows for the periods presented:\n\n\u2022 to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.\nDebt refinancings. In October 2016, we repaid our senior secured second lien term loan facility in full and revolving credit loans then-outstanding and borrowed an additional $150.0 million of term loans under our term loan facility at lower rates.\n\u2022 sales of products, services and solutions to engineering firms and municipalities to purify drinking water and treat wastewater globally; and\n(f)Represents:\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nReceivables are primarily comprised of uncollected amounts owed to us from transactions with customers and are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts. Allowances are estimated based on historical write-offs and the economic status of customers. We consider a receivable delinquent if it is unpaid after the term of the related invoice has expired. Write-offs are recorded at the time all collection efforts have been exhausted.\nApproximately $29.7 million, $33.5 million and $28.4 million of revenues from construction-type contracts were recognized on a completed contract method, which is typically when the product is delivered and accepted by the customer, during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The completed contract method is principally used when the contract is short in duration (generally less than twelve months) and where results of operations would not vary materially from those resulting from the use of the percentage-of-completion method. Cost and earnings in excess of billings under construction-type arrangements are recorded when contracts have net asset balances where contract costs plus recognized profits less recognized losses exceed progress billings. Billings in excess of costs incurred are recorded when contract progress billings exceed costs and recognized profit less recognized losses.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounts Receivable\n\u2022 The aggregate of receivables, inventories, cost and earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts, accounts payable and billings in excess of costs incurred on uncompleted contracts used $14.5 million in operating cash flows in fiscal 2016 compared to $19.9 million of operating cash flows provided in fiscal 2015. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the above mentioned accounts depends upon how effectively we manage our cash conversion cycle, which is a representation of the number of days that elapse from the date of purchase of raw\nWe evaluate our business segments' operating results based on income from operations and EBITDA on a segment basis. Corporate activities include general corporate expenses, elimination of intersegment transactions, interest income and expense and other unallocated charges, which have not been allocated to business segments. As such, the segment results provided herein may not be comparable to other companies.\nAs of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2017, we had letters of credit totaling $18.1 million and $17.2 million, respectively, and surety bonds totaling $102.2 million and $87.8 million respectively, outstanding under our credit arrangements. The longest maturity date of the letters of credit and surety bonds in effect as of September 30, 2017 was March 31, 2024. Additionally, as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2017, we had letters of credit totaling $1.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, and surety bonds totaling $43.7 million and $13.0 million, respectively, outstanding under our prior arrangement with Siemens.\nNet Income (Loss)\n\u2022 in our management incentive compensation which is based in part on components of Adjusted EBITDA;\n(iv)expenses related to maintaining non-operational business locations ($7.4 million in fiscal 2015, $1.8 million in fiscal 2016 and $1.9 million in fiscal 2017).\nProduct and Technology Development\n(1)Interest expense and Income tax expense (benefit) are corporate activities that are not allocated to our three reportable segments.\nOperating profit in the Industrial Segment increased $5.1 million, or 5.9%, to $91.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $86.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to increased volume of $5.8 million. Additionally, as part of the Value Creator program we initiated ePro activities, which resulted in a reduction to costs of $1.8 million and operational improvements in supply chain that resulted in reduced warranty expense and liabilities of $1.6 million. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable product mix of $4.3 million driven by large capital revenue that carries lower margins.\nRevenues in the Products Segment increased $70.4 million, or 27.6%, to $325.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $255.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in revenues was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto and Olson. These acquisitions accounted for an aggregate of $48.7 million of the increased revenues. The Products Segment also increased revenues in the amount of $9.2 million in our power and microelectronics markets. These increases were principally due to higher product sales of electrodeionization equipment in our legal entity in China. Additionally, there were increases of $7.7 million due to growth in the aquatics and disinfection division and $3.7 million from stronger capital sales.\nContractual Obligations\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued (ASU) 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. The ASU includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. ASU No. 2016 09 will be effective for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2017. We do not expect the implementation of this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOperational investment. Our historical operating results reflect the impact of our ongoing investments to support our growth. We have made significant investments in our business that we believe have laid the foundation for continued profitable growth. We believe that our strengthened sales force, mergers and acquisitions team, enhanced information systems, research, development and engineering investments and other factors enable us to support our operating model.\n\u2022ADI-On June 30, 2017, we completed the acquisition of ADI Systems North America Inc., Geomembrane Technologies Inc. and Lange Containment Systems, Inc. (collectively \"ADI\"), a leader in anaerobic digestion, aerobic treatment and biogas treatment, green energy recovery and water reuse technologies, as well as industrial wastewater cover liners and containment systems for a base purchase price of CAD 72.2 million (or approximately $55.6 million), of which CAD 67.3 million ($51.8 million) in cash was paid at closing and included the fair value of the earnout payments of CAD 4.9 million ($3.8 million). The maximum earnout payment of CAD 7.5 million (or approximately $5.8 million), is payable over a period of twenty-four months based upon the achievement of certain specified performance metrics. ADI is included in the results of our Industrial Segment.\nIn August 2017, we completed an incremental financing of $80.0 million. In this transaction we combined the incremental debt tranche of approximately $183 million associated with the Neptune Benson acquisition, along with the new borrowings of $80 million into our existing first lien term loan tranche a lower interest rate. Proceeds from the incremental financing were used to repay $60 million of revolving credit facility borrowings and the remainder was placed on the balance sheet for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions. We have the option to add one or more incremental term loans under our term loan facility or revolving credit facilities or increase commitments under our revolving credit facility. Further, our revolving credit facility and term loan facility are scheduled to mature in January 2019 and January 2021, respectively, and we will need to repay, refinance, replace or otherwise extend the maturity of our senior secured credit facilities. Accordingly, our results have been and will be impacted by substantial changes in our net interest expense throughout the periods presented and in the future. See \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below.\n\u2022 sales of tailored light industry technologies, heavy industry technologies and environmental products, services and solutions in collaboration with our industrial customers, backed by lifecycle services including emergency response services and build-own-operate alternatives, to a broad group of industrial customers in our U.S., Canada and Singapore markets;\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash generated by operating activities and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). Historically, we have financed our operations primarily from cash generated from operations and periodic borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our primary cash needs are for day to day operations, to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness, to fund working capital requirements and to make capital expenditures.\n\u2022 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\nconsistent with our business strategy and financial model, and, although we may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets and implement our growth strategy, we currently have a pipeline which includes more than 60 potential targets, which has been developed proactively by our team as well as informed by our customer base. Our acquisitions include:\nfrom operations, together with borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are sufficient to fund our principal debt payments, interest expense, our working capital needs and our expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months. Our capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 were $57.8 million. However, our budgeted capital expenditures can vary from period to period based on the nature of capital intensive project awards. We may draw on our Revolving Credit Facility from time to time to fund or partially fund an acquisition.\nSales of goods and services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered.\nOperating Expenses\nRevenues from product sales increased $87.9 million, or 15%, to $675.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $587.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in product revenues was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson, which accounted for $68.1 million. The remaining increase was related to organic revenue growth of approximately $8.6 million in the power and microelectronics\nMunicipal\nCost of services increased approximately $13.5 million in the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2015. This was commensurate with the increase in revenue volume, offset by the beneficial impact of various restructuring initiatives put in place over the previous period.\nChanges in costs. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, including steel, caustic, carbon, calcium nitrate and iridium, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross profit and gross margin. Further, additional potential acquisitions and international expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial, administrative and other resources. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance our management systems, financial and management controls and information systems. We will also be required to hire, train and retain operational and sales personnel, which affects our operating margins.\nWe review goodwill to determine potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting unit level. We have determined that we have four reporting units. Our quantitative impairment testing utilizes both a market (guideline public company) and income (discounted cash flows) method for determining fair value. In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation technique, we incorporate our judgment and estimates of future cash flows, future revenue and gross profit growth rates, terminal value amount, capital expenditures and applicable weighted-average cost of capital used to discount these estimated cash flows. The estimates and projections used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with our current budget and long-range plans, including anticipated change in market conditions, industry trend, growth rates and planned capital expenditures, among other considerations. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value, the second step is performed, where the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value.\n\u2022 make certain investments;\nConsolidated Results\n\u2022 Operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 reflected an increase in net income of $99.1 million from fiscal 2015. Net income in fiscal 2016 included a benefit from the relief of the income tax valuation allowance of $15.4 million compared to establishing an income tax valuation allowance of $63.3 million in fiscal 2015. Additionally in fiscal 2016, net income included the non-cash impact of foreign currency losses for intracompany loans primarily denominated in euro of $0.1 million compared to $19.3 million in fiscal 2015.\nOperating profit in the Products Segment increased $17.2 million, or 35.3%, to $65.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from the $48.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to the additional revenue volume and profitability associated with the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto and Olson. These acquisitions accounted for $10.1 million of the operating profit increase in the year ended September 30 2017. The aquatics and disinfection division saw operating profit grow $4.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. Operating profit in the electrodeionization equipment product lines also improved due to the increased revenues of $5.8 million in the Asia region, which accounted for $1.6 million in additional operating profit. Lastly, operating profit in the marine end markets improved $1.1 million.\nIn addition, our Revolving Credit Facility, but not the Term Loan Facility, contains a financial covenant which requires us to comply with the maximum first lien net leverage ratio of 5.55 to 1.00 as of the last day of any quarter on which the aggregate amount of revolving loans and letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility (net of cash collateralized letters of credit and undrawn outstanding letters of credit in an amount of up to 50% of the Revolving Credit Facility) exceeds 25% of the total commitments thereunder.\nRevenues in the Municipal Segment increased $4.4 million, or 1.6%, to $278.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $273.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in revenues was primarily due to volume sold in both our service business, through geographical expansion and new product rollouts delivering $6.6 million increase from the prior year, and growth in aftermarket $6.4 million. This is offsetting a decline of $4.5 million in capital due project\nOperational Excellence", "item_7_text": "microelectronics and power markets drove an increase in cost of sales of approximately $17.4 million, however, purchasing and supply chain productivity measures that were implemented to adjust for the standalone nature of the Company supported a reduction in cost of sales of approximately $6.2 million. Cost of product sales was also favorably impacted by the final stages of the wind down of our Italian operations, which drove a decrease of approximately $11.7 million in cost of sales and a corresponding increase in gross profit of $4.5 million as compared to the prior year. Additionally, commensurate with the delays in revenues, cost of sales were reduced in the marine and power product retrofit markets by approximately $9.7 million.\n\nWe believe our strong brands, leading position in highly fragmented markets, scalable and global offerings, leading installed base and unique ability to provide complete treatment solutions will enable us to capture a larger share of our existing customers' water treatment spend while expanding with existing and new customers into adjacent end-markets and underpenetrated regions, including by investing in our sales force and cross-selling to existing customers. We are uniquely positioned to further penetrate our core markets, with over 200,000 installations across over 38,000 global customers. We maintain a customer-intimate business model with strong brand value and provide solutions-focused offerings capable of serving a customer's full lifecycle water treatment needs, both in current and new geographic regions.\n(c)Does not reflect the approximately $104.9 million of indebtedness (including accrued and unpaid interest) under the Term Loan Facility that we repaid in connection with our initial public offering.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin-Total gross margin increased to 32% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from 29.3% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\n\nOperating profit in the Municipal Segment increased $5.4 million, or 17.1%, to $36.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $31.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nSales and Marketing Expense-Sales and marketing expenses increased $10.8 million, or 8.7%, to $135.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $124.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The driving factor for the increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with reinvigoration and expansion of the sales force, which drove an increase in salaries and benefits of approximately $9.8 million, coupled with implementation of sales initiatives such as training and rebranding, which incurred approximately $1.2 million of additional cost.\n(ii)$3.5 million gain on the sale of assets, primarily related to the disposition of our non-core waste management location in Vernon, California (the \"Vernon Disposition\");\n\u2022 the U.S. and global capital market conditions.\n\u2022 present value of estimated future cash flows;\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). This new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The guidance should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, unless deemed impracticable, in which case prospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nProducts\nCost of services primarily consists of the cost of personnel and travel for our field service, supply chain and technicians, depreciation of equipment and field service vehicles and freight costs.\n\u2022Magneto-On April 11, 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of privately held Magneto Special Anodes B.V. (\"Magneto\"), a leader in the development and manufacture of anodes for the electrochemical industry and refurbishment of electrochlorination cells for seawater electrolysis for \u20ac23.6 million (or approximately $26.7 million). Magneto is included in the results of our Products Segment.\n\u2022Neptune-Benson-On April 15, 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of privately held Neptune-Benson, a leading manufacturer of high-quality water filtration and disinfection products for the commercial, industrial and municipal water markets for $283.7 million. Neptune-Benson is included in the results of our Products Segment.\n\u2022 Operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 reflect a decrease in net income of $6.6 million as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and increased non-cash charges of $42.4 million primarily relating to deferred taxes and increased depreciation and amortization. The increased deferred tax impacts relate to increases in valuation allowances as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 primarily driven by an increase in net operating losses incurred.\nNet Income-Net income increased $99.1 million, or 115.1%, to net income of $13.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from a net loss of $86.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The primary driver of the increase in net income was the transition from a large tax expense of $47.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 to a tax benefit of $18.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, a change of approximately $66.3 million. The change in tax expense was related to the establishment and subsequent partial release of valuation allowance. Additional contributors to the increase in net income included the improvement in gross profit of approximately $40.7 million driven by revenue volume and profitability as discussed above, as well as the increase in other operating income of approximately $6.9 million discussed above. These contributors to net income were offset by the overall increase in operating expenses of approximately $4.9 million.\nWe amortize these assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. This amortization methodology best matches the pattern of economic benefit that is expected from the definite-lived intangible assets.\nOrganic Growth Drivers\nreporting and corporate governance requirements. These requirements include compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as well as other rules implemented by the SEC and the NYSE. Our financial statements following our initial public offering will reflect the impact of these expenses. In addition, the one-time grant of stock-settled restricted stock unit awards made in connection with the initial public offering to certain members of management will result in increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which will be incremental to our ongoing stock-based compensation expense. This stock-based compensation expense is expected to be expensed beginning in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2018 and continuing over the following eight fiscal quarters. For more information, please see Item 11, \"Executive Compensation-IPO Awards-Restricted Stock Units.\"\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Conditions that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in customer demand or business climate that could affect the value of an asset, a product recall or an adverse action by a regulator. Recoverability of the asset or asset group is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to undiscounted future net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its respective fair value which is generally determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows or as the appraised value.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:\nRevenues from services increased $22.8 million, or 4.3%, to $550.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $527.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Service and capital system support revenues increased in the power, hydrocarbon and chemical processing end markets for approximately $6.4 million, driven by penetration into new and existing customer accounts, as well as service business growth in the Municipal Segment for approximately $4.4 million through geographical expansion and rollout of new service offerings. The consolidation of TWO, our joint venture that sells water management equipment and services, also accounted for approximately $11.6 million of the increase in service revenues.\nhandle our customers' complete water needs through on-demand water management, predictive maintenance and service response planning. Water One also enables us to transition our customers to more accurate pricing models based on usage, which otherwise would not have been possible without technological advancement. Our technology solutions provide customers with increased stability and predictability in water-related costs, while enabling us to optimize our service route network and on demand offerings through predictive analytics, which we believe will result in market share gains, improved service levels, increased barriers to entry and reduced costs.\nExchange rates. The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. We operate in numerous countries around the world and therefore, certain of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the euro, U.K. sterling, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Singapore dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. As a result, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items recorded in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in the functional currency. While we believe we are not susceptible to any material impact on our results of operations caused by fluctuations in exchange rates because our operations are primarily conducted in the United States, if we expand our foreign operations in the future, substantial increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these other currencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nended September 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by increased tax expense of $7.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to a tax benefit of $18.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, a difference of $25.8 million. Furthermore, $12.9 million of additional interest expense was incurred in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. These factors offset the increased revenue volume and profitability associated with the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson, which accounted for $11.6 million of increased net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. The increased volume and profitability as well as incremental benefits from restructuring activities and operational efficiencies that were implemented in the prior year (net of charges from additional restructuring actions taken in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017) contributed the remaining $1.3 million to net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.\n(c)Represents non-cash stock-based compensation expenses related to option awards. See Note 15, \"Stock Option Plan\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail.\nConsolidated Results\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses increased $4.9 million, or 1.6%, to $302.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $298.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The largest driver in the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF and Delta UV accounting for $9.8 million of the operating expense increase and Magneto accounting for $2.7 million of the increase. These increases in operating expenses were offset with decreases in expenses in the other segments. A discussion of operating expenses by category is as follows:\n\u2022 Within the Industrial Segment, we primarily provide tailored solutions in collaboration with our customers backed by life-cycle services including on-demand water, build-own-operated (\"BOO\"), recycle and reuse and emergency response service alternatives to improve operational reliability, performance and environmental compliance.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)-Income tax was an expense of $7.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to a benefit of $18.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, an increase of 140.2%. The effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 was 53.6% as compared to 343.0% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. This change was primarily the result of an increase in the valuation allowance during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, compared to a decrease in valuation allowance in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\nEBITDA on a segment basis is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The following is a reconciliation of our segment operating profit to EBITDA on a segment basis:\nEBITDA on a segment basis is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The following is a reconciliation of our segment operating profit to EBITDA on a segment basis:\nMarket Growth\n(2)For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to net income (loss), its most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, see \"-How We Assess the Performance of Our Business-Adjusted EBITDA.\"\nOperating profit in the Industrial Segment increased $18.6 million, or 20.3%, to $110.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $91.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in operating profit was primarily related to an increase in volume of $9.4 million as well as $9.8 million of benefits experienced as a result of our Value Creator initiatives. Value Creator benefits include carry over benefits from operational efficiency initiatives that we implemented in the prior fiscal year.\nAs of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2017, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nAccruals for estimated expenses related to warranties are made at the time products are sold and are recorded as a component of cost of product sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The estimated warranty obligation is based on product warranty terms offered to customers, ongoing product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs expected to be incurred in correcting a product failure, as well as specific obligations for known failures and other currently available evidence. We assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities on a regular basis and adjust amounts as necessary.\nlosses and expenses. We present Adjusted EBITDA, which is not a recognized financial measure under GAAP, because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, we believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results, because it excludes the results of decisions that are outside the control of management, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance as follows:\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nManagement evaluated the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates and believes that the following involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position, and are therefore discussed as critical. The following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. With respect to critical accounting policies, even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations. More information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in \"Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The amendments in this ASU are effective for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2020. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nEBITDA in the Municipal Segment increased $9.6 million, or 32.3%, to $39.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $29.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. EBITDA increased because of the same factors that affected operating profit in the Municipal Segment during this period, with the addition of our fleet optimization as part of our Value Creator program, converting it from an operating lease to a capital lease driving an increase of approximately $0.8 million in EBITDA.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk and prevent us from meeting our obligations. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations.\"\nIn connection with the Acquisition, we entered into the \"Senior Secured Credit Facilities,\" which originally consisted of (a) a seven-year $505.0 million senior secured first lien term loan facility (the \"Term Loan Facility\"), scheduled to mature on January 15, 2021 and a $75.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"), scheduled to mature on January 15, 2019 and (b) a seven-year $75.0 million senior secured second lien term loan facility, scheduled to mature on January 15, 2022 (which is no longer outstanding). On April 15, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our first lien credit agreement, dated as of January 15, 2014 (the \"First Lien Credit Agreement\"), to borrow an additional $185.0 million of term loans under our Term Loan Facility to fund a portion of the consideration for the Neptune-Benson Acquisition. On October 28, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the First Lien Credit Agreement to (i) borrow an additional $150.0 million of term loans under our Term Loan Facility to fund our repayment in full of our second lien facility and revolving credit loans then outstanding and (ii) increase commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by $20.0 million to a total of $95.0 million. On August 8, 2017, we entered into another amendment to the First Lien Credit Agreement pursuant to which we (i) borrowed approximately $262.7 million in refinancing term loans, the net proceeds of which were used to refinance in their entirety the loans incurred in connection with the Neptune-Benson Acquisition and (ii) increased the amount of our existing Term Loan Facility by borrowing $80.0 million of incremental term loans under the Term Loan Facility, the net proceeds of which were used to repay $60.0 million of revolving credit loans then outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and to pay related fees and expenses, and for other general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions and permitted investments pursuant to the First Lien Credit Agreement). On November 7, 2017, we used a portion of the proceeds of our initial public offering to repay approximately $104.9 million of indebtedness (including accrued and unpaid interest) under the Term Loan Facility. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities also include an uncommitted incremental facility, which, subject to certain conditions, provides for additional term loans and/or revolving loans in an aggregate amount that does not cause our first lien net leverage ratio to exceed 4.50 to 1.00 (calculated as the ratio of consolidated funded first lien debt for borrowed money (net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) to trailing four-quarter Consolidated EBITDA (as defined therein), plus an additional $100 million (excluding incremental revolving credit loans or increases in revolving credit commitments not exceeding $30.0 million) (all of which remained available as of September 30, 2017).\n$47.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was 343.0% compared to an effective tax rate of (125.6)% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in income tax expense and effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the benefit resulting from the release of valuation allowance as a result of additional deferred tax liabilities recognized in connection with the Neptune-Benson Acquisition.\nInvesting Activities\nResearch and Development Expense-Research and development expenses decreased $2.9 million, or 12.7%, to $20.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $22.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Research and development expenses increased $1.0 million with the acquisition of Magneto and their extensive research and development programs related to anode coatings, but was offset by decrease of approximately $1.5 million in research and development expenses in connection with the consolidation and restructuring of our Singaporean research and development center as well as a reduction of approximately $0.9 million associated with a restructuring program in the Municipal Segment implemented in December, 2016.. Additionally, we received reimbursements from the Singapore government for research and development credits in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 of approximately $1.3 million.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Scope of Modification Accounting, which amended Accounting Standards Code Topic 718. FASB issued ASU 2017-09 to reduce the cost and complexity when applying Topic 718 and standardize the practice of applying Topic 718 to financial reporting. The ASU was not developed to fundamentally change the definition of a modification, but instead to provide guidance for what changes would qualify as a modification. ASU No. 2017-09 will be effective for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2018. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.\nIndustrial\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. The ASU includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2017. We do not expect the implementation of this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues in the Industrial Segment increased $35.2 million, or 6.2%, to $604.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $569.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in revenues was primarily due to the execution of an additional $17.3 million of capital project orders compared to the prior fiscal year in the power, pulp and paper end markets. Service and capital system revenues increased in power and hydrocarbon and chemical processing end markets by $6.4 million, driven by penetration into new and existing accounts. In addition the consolidation of TWO drove a net increase in revenue of $11.6 million. This increase was partially offset by a decline in aftermarket revenue.\nThe increase in operating profit was primarily due to the continued Value Creator benefits in both project execution and ePro of $2.4 million, benefits from the alignment to a more customer focused organizational structure of $2.8 million, and reduced warranty expense of $1.3 million. This was partially offset by increased labor costs of approximately $1.8 million.\nCost of Sales, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nOur Service Model\nRetirement Benefits\nN/M-Not meaningful\nOperating profit in the Municipal Segment increased $9.2 million, or 41.3%, to $31.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $22.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating profit excluding Italy was primarily due to $2.6 million from volume, and the implementation of the Value Creator program, which delivered efficiencies in order execution and $2.8 million savings in ePro. The final stages in closure of our Italian operations improved our operating profit by $5.9 million, while operational efficiencies in both project execution and ePro noted above, and continued alignment to a more customer focused organizational structure favorably drove the results by $2.1 million. This increase was partially offset by sales investments.\n\u2022 incur liens; or\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\u2022 sales of a wide variety of differentiated products and technologies, to an array of OEM, distributor, end-user, engineering firm and integrator customers in all of our geographic markets and aftermarket channels.\n(a)Represents:\nInventories\nCost of product sales consists of all manufacturing costs required to bring a product to a ready for sale condition, including direct and indirect materials, direct and indirect labor costs including benefits, freight, depreciation, information technology, rental and insurance, repair and maintenance, utilities, other manufacturing costs, warranties and third party commissions.\nContractual relationships with customers. Due to our large installed base and the nature of our contractual relationships with our customers, we have high visibility into a large portion of our revenue. The one- to twenty-year terms of many of our service contracts and the regular delivery and replacement of many of our products help to insulate us from the negative impact of any economic decline.\nPublic company costs. As a result of our initial public offering, we will incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur, including costs associated with SEC\nLiquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs, debt service, acquisitions, other commitments and contractual obligations. We consider liquidity in terms of cash flows from operations and their sufficiency to fund our operating and investing activities.\nThese estimates are no longer necessary to determine the fair value of new awards since the underlying shares are now publicly traded. Stock options are granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than the estimated fair market value on the date of grant as authorized by our compensation committee. Options granted vest ratably at 25% per year and are exercisable at the time of vesting. Stock option grants are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting. Prior to our initial public offering, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock option awards granted. We considered the retirement and forfeiture provisions of the options and utilized our historical experience and the experience of similar public companies to estimate the expected life of the options. We based the risk-free interest rate on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury security with a maturity generally equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant. We estimated the volatility of the share price of our common stock by considering the historical volatility of the stock of similar public entities. We estimated the dividend yield to be zero as we did not intend to pay dividends in the future. In determining the appropriateness of the public entities included in the volatility assumption we considered a number of factors, including the entity's life cycle stage, growth profile, size, financial leverage and products offered. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award, net of estimated forfeitures, and is recognized as a component of general and administrative expense over the requisite vesting period.\n(1)Interest expense and Income tax expense (benefit) are corporate activities that are not allocated to our three reportable segments.\nRevenues in the Products Segment increased $36.7 million, or 16.8%, to $255.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $218.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto which accounted for $42.9 million of additional revenues. The increase was partially offset by delays in the marine and power product retrofit markets which experienced a decrease in product revenues of $14.0 million. Revenues for highly purified water in the microelectronics and power markets increased by $7.8 million with the establishment of a new legal entity and sales presence in China.\nRevenues from product sales increased $53.4 million, or 10.0%, to $587.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $533.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in revenues was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, ETS and Magneto. These acquisitions accounted for $44.4 million of the increase in product revenues. Other areas of product revenue growth included an increase in the execution of capital project orders of approximately $17.3 million as compared to the prior year in the power and pulp and paper end markets, as well as an increase of approximately $7.8 million for products related to highly purified water in the microelectronics and power markets with the establishment of a new legal entity and sales presence in the China market. This increase was partially offset by delays in the marine and power product retrofit markets, which experienced a decrease in product revenues of approximately $14.0 million.\nBusiness Segments\nGross profit is determined by subtracting cost of product sales and cost of services from our product and services revenue. Gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our combined product and services revenue.\nUse of Estimates\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $10.0 million to $31.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $41.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the following:\n\nRevenues-Revenues increased $76.2 million, or 7.2%, to $1,137.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $1,061.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.\n\u2022Olson-On June 30, 2017, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of privately held Olson Irrigation Systems (\"Olson\"), a leading designer and producer of filters and irrigation components for the agriculture and industrial markets, for $9.4 million. Olson is included in the results of our Products Segment.\n\nWe maintain a leading position among customers in growing industries that utilize water as a critical part of their operations or production processes, including pharmaceuticals and health sciences, microelectronics, food and beverage, hydrocarbon and chemical processing, power, general manufacturing, municipal drinking and wastewater, marine and aquatics. Water treatment is an essential, non-discretionary market that is growing in importance as access to clean water has become an international priority. Underpinning this growth are a number of global, long-term trends that have resulted in increasingly stringent effluent regulations, along with a growing demand for cleaner and sustainable waste streams for reuse. These trends include the growing global population, increasing levels of urbanization and continued global economic growth, and we have seen these trends manifest themselves within our various end markets creating multiple avenues of growth. For example, within the industrial market, water is an integral and meaningful component in the production of a wide-range of goods spanning from consumer electronics to automobiles.\n\u2022 sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\nEBITDA in the Products Segment increased $15.9 million, or 40.5%, to $55.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $39.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in EBITDA was primarily due to the Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto acquisitions.\n\nProducts\nWhile we do not believe it to be significant, our business does exhibit seasonality resulting from our customers' increasing demand for our products and services during the spring and summer months as compared to the fall and winter months. For example, our Municipal Segment experiences increased demand for our odor control product lines and services in the warmer months which, together with other factors, typically results in improved performance in the second half of our fiscal year. Inclement weather, such as hurricanes, droughts and floods, can also drive increased demand for our products and services. As a result, our results from operations may vary from period to period.\n\u2022Noble-On May 9, 2017, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Noble Water Technologies, Inc. (\"Noble\"), which provides water equipment and treatment systems for commercial buildings, industrial plants, medical laboratories and the pharmaceutical industry, with a focus on the Texas market, for $7.6 million, consisting of $5.9 million cash paid at closing and $1.7 million related to a $2.4 million maximum earnout payment subject to various performance metrics measured at the end of the 12 month period following closing. Noble supports our existing high-purity water capabilities and is based in Dallas, Texas. Noble is included in the results of our Industrial Segment.\n(ii)legal settlement costs and intellectual property related fees associated with legacy matters prior to the Acquisition, including fees and settlement costs related to product warranty litigation on MEMCOR products and certain discontinued products ($11.7 million in fiscal 2015, reflected as components of Cost of product sales and services ($10.7 million) and General and administrative expenses ($1.0 million), $5.1 million, primarily reflected as a component of Cost of product sales and services in fiscal 2016 and $2.5 million, primarily reflected as components of Cost of product sales and services ($0.4 million) and General and administrative expenses ($2.1 million) in fiscal 2017);\nEquity-based Compensation\n\u2022 to make budgeting decisions; and\n\u2022 agree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries;\nProduct Warranties\nSeasonality\nOur vision \"to be the world's first choice in water solutions\" and our values of \"integrity, customers and performance\" foster a corporate culture that is focused on employee enablement, empowerment and accountability, which creates a highly entrepreneurial and dynamic work environment. Our purpose is \"Transforming water. Enriching life.\" We draw from a long legacy of water treatment innovations and industry firsts, supported by more than 1,250 granted or pending patents, which in aggregate are important to our business. Our core technologies are primarily focused on removing impurities from water, rather than neutralizing them through the addition of chemicals, and we are able to achieve purification levels which are 1,000 times greater than typical drinking water.\n(iii)foreign exchange impact related to headquarter allocations ($0.7 million gain in fiscal 2016, and $1.2 million loss in fiscal 2017); and\n\n\u2022 the market performance and financial results of comparable publicly-traded companies;\nFiscal Years Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2017\n\u2022 Within the Products Segment, we provide a highly differentiated and scalable range of products and technologies specified by global water treatment designers, OEMs, engineering firms and integrators.\n\u2022 designate any of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and marketing promotions of our products, services and solutions and related personnel expenses (including all Evoqua sales and application employees' base compensation and incentives), as well as sponsorship costs, consulting and contractor expenses, travel, display expenses and related amortization. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to actively promote our products, services and solutions.\n(i)impact of foreign exchange gains and losses ($19.0 million loss in fiscal 2015, $0.5 million loss in fiscal 2016 and $7.8 million gain in fiscal 2017);\nOur ability to source and distribute products effectively. Our revenues are affected by our ability to purchase our inputs in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. While we believe our suppliers have adequate capacity to meet our current and anticipated demand, our level of revenues could be adversely affected in the event of constraints in our supply chain, including the inability of our suppliers to produce sufficient quantities of raw materials in a manner that is able to match demand from our customers.\n\u2022 Accrued expenses and other liabilities used $31.4 million in operating cash flows in fiscal 2016 compared to $14.6 million used in fiscal 2015. This increased use of operational cash flow resulted primarily from the timing of cash payments for various employee-related and other restructuring activities during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $76.9 million from $191.4 million of net cash provided by financing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 to net cash provided by financing activities of $114.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. This lower amount of cash provided by financing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 was primarily due to higher payment of debt. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we refinanced $75.0 million of our second lien facilities into our first lien facilities. In addition, we continued to repay debt in accordance with each applicable credit agreement's terms, including repayment of amounts borrowed from the Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, we paid increased dividends to the noncontrolling interest, offset by a reduction in proceeds from both capital contributions and common stock issuances.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense-General and administrative expenses decreased $2.9 million, or 2.0%, to $144.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $147.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto accounted for a $11.7 million increase in general and administrative expenses, which was offset by a $14.6 million decrease in general and administrative expenses as a result of restructuring actions and other cost savings initiatives taken across the business.\n\u2022 pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock;\nNet Income-Net income decreased by $6.6 million, or 50.8%, to net income of $6.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to net income of $13.0 million for the fiscal year\nInterest Expense-Interest expense increased $8.4 million, or 24.8%, to $42.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $34.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense is due to an increase in borrowing for acquisitions, interest on capital leases and fees associated with our senior secured credit facilities.\nMunicipal\n\u2022 industry or company-specific considerations;\nRevenue\nAdjusted EBITDA-Adjusted EBITDA increased $40.2 million, or 33.5%, to $160.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $119.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Increased volume and carry over benefits from restructuring and operational efficiencies that we implemented in the prior year provided $17.1 million of the increase in Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, revenue volume and profitability associated with the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto contributed approximately $15.9 million of the increase in Adjusted EBITDA, while the final stages in closure of our Italian operations improved our profitability by $5.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\nRevenues in the Industrial Segment increased $39.2 million, or 6.5%, to $643.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $604.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in service revenues of $27.7 million driven by higher customer production levels in general manufacturing and pharmaceutical and healthcare end markets and new account penetration in power and hydrocarbon and chemical processing end markets. In addition, an increase of $19.4 million of revenue was attributable to our acquisitions of ETS, ADI and Noble during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. Our increased revenues were partially offset by a decrease of $7.9 million in revenues related to the Vernon Disposition as of September 30, 2016.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and require management to make estimates and assumptions. These assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are used for, but not limited to: (i) revenue recognition; (ii) allowance for doubtful accounts; (iii) inventory valuation, asset valuations, impairment and recoverability assessments; (iv) depreciable lives of assets; (v) useful lives of intangible assets; (vi) income tax reserves and valuation allowances and (vii) product warranty and litigation reserves. Estimates are revised as additional information becomes available. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n(1)We hold a 50% partnership interest in TWO, which, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015, we accounted for under the equity method and did not consolidate, as we did not have a controlling financial interest based on the shared powers of both joint venture partners to direct the activities that most significantly impact TWO's financial performance. On October 1, 2015, a change occurred in the partnership structure of TWO such that we are now obligated to absorb all risk of loss up to 100% of the joint venture partner's equity. As such, the accounting for our 50% interest changed from equity method investment to full consolidation as a variable interest entity under ASC 810.\nand, if expectations differ from previous estimates, adjusted accordingly. Estimated useful lives for major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:\nSegment Results\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments on an on-going basis.\nWe develop our technologies through in-house research, development and engineering and targeted tuck-in, technology-enhancing and geography-expanding acquisitions. We have a reservoir of recently launched technologies and a strong pipeline of new offerings designed to provide customers with innovative, value-enhancing solutions. Furthermore, we have successfully completed eight technology-enhancing and geography-expanding acquisitions since April 2016 to add new capabilities and cross-selling opportunities in areas such as electrochemical and electrochlorination cells, regenerative media filtration, anodes, UV disinfection and aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment technologies. We are able to rapidly scale new technologies using our leading direct and third-party sales channels and our relationships with key influencers, including municipal representatives, engineering firms, designers and other system specifiers. We believe our continued investment in driving penetration of our recently launched technologies, robust pipeline of new capabilities and best-in-class channels to market will allow us to continue to address our customer needs across the water lifecycle.\n\u2022 likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a sale of the company;\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses increased $29.2 million, or 9.6%, to $332.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $302.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\nN/M-Not meaningful\nRevenues from services increased $22.3 million, or 4.1%, to $572.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $550.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase was driven mainly by organic revenue growth, including volume driven increases in Industrial service revenue of approximately $27.7 million associated with higher U.S. customer production levels in the general manufacturing and pharmaceutical and healthcare end markets and new account penetration in the power and hydrocarbon and chemical processing end markets, and an increase of approximately $2.4 million related to our Municipal services business. These increases were offset by approximately $7.9 million in revenues related to our Vernon location in the year ended September 30, 2016 that did not reoccur because of the Vernon Disposition as of September 30, 2016.\nNet income (loss) is determined by subtracting operating expenses and interest expense from, and adding other operating income (expense), equity income from our partnership interest in TWO and income tax benefit (expense) to, gross profit. For more information on how we determine gross profit, see \"-Gross Profit.\"\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to invest in developing new products, services and solutions and enhancing our existing products, services and solutions.\n\u2022 The aggregate of non-current assets and non-current liabilities provided $16.0 million in operating cash flows in fiscal 2016 compared to $3.2 million used in fiscal 2015. The cash flows related to this increase in fiscal 2016 include an increase in pension liabilities of $8.1 million compared to a decrease of pension liability of $0.3 million in fiscal 2015, driven by declines in discount rates used to value projected benefit obligations. Additionally, $8.8 million of long term capital leases were entered into in fiscal 2016.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties that are under Common Control. The ASU changes how a single decision maker of a VIE that holds indirect interest in the entity through related parties that are under common control determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The new guidance amends ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, issued in February 2015. The guidance should be applied coincidentally with the adoption of ASU 2015-02, which was effective for us for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $297.7 million from $46.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 to $344.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune Benson, Magneto, VAF and Delta UV, which were consummated during fiscal 2016 with a total cash outlay of $306.4 million. This cash outlay on acquisitions was offset, in part, by proceeds of $4.5 million from the Vernon Disposition, and $5.2 million on the sale of vacant facilities.\nEBITDA in the Municipal Segment increased $5.3 million, or 13.5%, to $44.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $39.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. EBITDA increased as a result of the same factors which impacted operating profit in the Municipal Segment during this period.\nWe expect to continue to finance our liquidity requirements through internally generated funds and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that our projected cash flows generated\n\u2022 to assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance;\n\u2022 The aggregate of prepaid expense and other assets and other non current assets and liabilities used $6.6 million in operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 compared to $17.3 million provided in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The use of operational cash flow in the period ended September 30, 2017 was primarily related to the reduction of a long term lease receivable in addition and increase in the lease liability offset by a change in pension liability.\n\u2022ETS-On November 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Environmental Treatment Systems Inc. (\"ETS\"), which adds organic wastewater treatment capability to our industrial treatment solutions, for $10.7 million. ETS further allows us to insource manufacturing of dissolved air flotation units, the production of which we previously outsourced. ETS is included in the results of our Industrial Segment.\n\u2022 The aggregate of receivables, inventories, cost and earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts, accounts payable and billings in excess of costs incurred on uncompleted contracts used $61.3 million in operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 compared to $10.1 million in operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the above mentioned accounts depends upon how effectively we manage our cash conversion cycle, which is a representation of the number of days that elapse from the date of purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from customers. Our cash conversion cycle can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period. Further, as it relates to capital projects, fiscal 2017 represented a continued rebuilding of the pipeline of capital projects as compared to the period prior to the Acquisition, which represented a depletion of the pipeline of capital projects. This build-up of capital project activity contributed to the variability of accounts receivable, inventories, excess billings on uncompleted contracts or billings in excess of costs incurred on uncompleted contracts from period to period.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires recognition of operating leases as lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 will be effective retrospectively for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table provides the change in revenues from product sales and revenues from services, respectively:\n\ntiming. This revenue growth was also partially offset by a decline of $4.1 million in revenues due to the final stages in closure of our Italian operations.\nThe following table provides the change in revenues from product sales and revenues from services, respectively:\n\nSales and Marketing Expense-Sales and marketing expenses increased $7.2 million, or 5.3%, to $142.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $135.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The driving factor in the increase in sales and marketing expense was an increase of $10.9 million associated with the sales and marketing activities of the acquired companies of Neptune Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson. This increase was offset by a decrease in the bad debt reserve of $2.5 million related to aligning our bad debt reserve in addition to recovering a receivable that had been previously written off.\nAvailability of water. In general, we expect demand for our products and services to increase as the availability of clean water from public sources decreases. Secular trends that will drive demand for water across a multitude of industrial, commercial and municipal applications include global population growth, urbanization, industrialization and overall economic growth. In addition, the supply of clean water could be adversely impacted by factors including an aging water infrastructure within North\n\u2022Delta UV-On August 3, 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Delta Ultraviolet Corporation (\"Delta UV\"), a leading manufacturer and marketer of UV-C technology in North America for $4.8 million. Delta UV is included in the results of our Products Segment.\n\u2022 to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies;\nOperating Activities\nOur business is organized by customer base and offerings into three reportable segments that each draw from the same reservoir of leading technologies, shared manufacturing infrastructure, common business processes and corporate philosophies. Our reportable segments consist of: (i) our Industrial Segment, (ii) our Municipal Segment and (iii) our Products Segment. The key factors used to identify these reportable segments are the organization and alignment of our internal operations, the nature of the products and services and customer type.\nCost of product sales increased by approximately $22.2 million in the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cost of sales for our products business was primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto. These acquisitions accounted for $21.2 million of the increase in cost of sales as well as a corresponding gross profit increase of approximately $23.2 million and were the primary driver of the 2.8% increase in gross margin. Increases in revenues related to capital project orders and sales in the\nWe account for awards of equity instruments in accordance with relevant authoritative literature. Prior to our initial public offering, given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, the fair value of the common stock underlying our share-based awards was determined by our board, with input from management, in each case using the income and market valuation approach. We believe that our board had the relevant experience and expertise to determine the fair value of our common stock. In accordance with the Accounting and Valuation Guide: Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, our board exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock including:\nOur Existing Customer Base\nCost of services increased by approximately $5.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in cost of services was related to an overall increase in revenue volume, offset by the benefits of cost efficiencies implemented as well as $7.6 million related to the cost of services attributable to the Vernon Disposition as of September 30, 2016.\nNew products and technologies. Our ability to maintain our appeal to existing customers and attract new customers depends on our ability to originate, develop and offer a compelling array of products, services and solutions responsive to evolving customer innovations, preferences and specifications. We expect that increased use of water in industrial and commercial processes will drive increased customer demand in the future, and our ability to grow will depend in part on effectively responding to innovation in our customers' processes and systems. Further, our ability to provide products that comply with evolving government regulations will also be a driver of the appeal of our products, services and solutions to industrial and commercial customers.\nInflation and deflation trends. Our financial results can be expected to be directly impacted by substantial increases in costs due to commodity cost increases or general inflation which could lead to a reduction in our revenues as well as greater margin pressure as increased costs may not be able to be passed on to customers. To date, changes in commodity prices and general inflation have not materially impacted our business.\nCost of product sales increased by approximately $38.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in cost of product sales was primarily driven by the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson, which accounted for $32.5 million. These accretive acquisitions were the primary driver of the increase of 330 basis points in gross margin percentage. The remaining increase in cost of product sales was due to organic growth driven by higher sales volumes due to increased U.S customer production levels in the general manufacturing and pharmaceutical and healthcare end markets and the power and microelectronics markets in the Asian region. These increases in cost of product sales were partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million related to the wind down of our Italian operations.\nFinancing Activities\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, where cost is generally determined on the basis of an average or first-in, first-out method. Production costs comprise direct material and labor and applicable manufacturing overheads, including depreciation charges. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write off excess or obsolete inventory based on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements. Manufacturing operations recognize cost of product sales using standard costing rates with overhead absorption which generally approximates actual cost.\n\u2022 our historical and projected operating and financial results, including capital expenditures;\nFor sales of aftermarket parts or products with a low level of customization and engineering time, we recognize revenues at the time title and risks and rewards of ownership pass, which is generally when products are shipped or delivered to the customer as we have no obligation for installation. Sales\nCash Flows\n(e)Represents expenses associated with acquisition and divestiture-related activities and post-acquisition integration costs and accounting, tax, consulting, legal and other fees and expenses associated with acquisition transactions ($5.4 million in fiscal 2016 and $7.3 million in fiscal 2017).\nThe following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated:\n\u2022 consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n(b)Represents adjustments for the effect of the purchase accounting step-up in the value of inventory to fair value recognized in cost of goods sold as a result of the Acquisition and the acquisition of Magneto.\n(1)For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to net income (loss), its most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, see \"-How We Assess the Performance of Our Business-Adjusted EBITDA.\"\nIndustrial\nOur sales are a function of sales volumes and selling prices, each of which is a function of the mix of product and service sales, and consist primarily of:\nEBITDA in the Products Segment increased $22.3 million, or 40.5%, to $77.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $55.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, with $15.6 million attributable to the Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto and Olson. The balance of $6.7 million was due to growth in the other product lines and reduced operating expenses from restructuring in the prior period.\nIn addition to the above, our chief operating decision maker uses EBITDA of each reportable segment to evaluate the operating performance of such segments.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nAmerica and increased levels of water stress from seasonal rainfall, inadequate water storage options or treatment technologies. Because water is a critical component and byproduct of many processes, including in manufacturing and product development, we expect that, as global consumption patterns evolve and water shortages persist, demand for our equipment and services will continue to increase.\n\u2022 in certain calculations under our senior secured credit facilities, which use components of Adjusted EBITDA.\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key indicators of the financial condition and operating performance of our business are revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA.\n\u2022 enter into transactions with our affiliates;\n(iv)costs incurred by us in connection with the initial public offering, including consultant costs and public company compliance costs ($0.5 million in fiscal 2016, reflected as a component of General and administrative expense and $8.3 million in fiscal 2017, reflected as a component of General and administrative expense).\n\n(1)We hold a 50% partnership interest in TWO, which, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015, we accounted for under the equity method and did not consolidate, as we did not have a controlling financial interest based on the shared powers of both joint venture partners to direct the activities that most significantly impact TWO's financial performance. On October 1, 2015, a change occurred in the partnership structure of TWO such that we are now obligated to absorb all risk of loss up to 100% of the joint venture partner's equity. As such, the accounting for our 50% interest changed from equity method investment to full consolidation as a variable interest entity under ASC 810.\nThe following table provides the change in cost of product sales and cost of services, respectively, along with related gross margins:\nAdjusted EBITDA is one of the primary metrics used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax benefit (expense) and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain other items, including restructuring and related business transformation costs, purchase accounting adjustment costs, non-cash stock-based compensation, sponsor fees, transaction costs and other gains,\n\u2022 amounts of indebtedness;\nProperty, plant, and equipment is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. If the costs of certain components of an item of property, plant, and equipment are significant in relation to the total cost of the item, they are accounted for and depreciated separately. Depreciation expense is recognized using the straight-line method. Useful lives are reviewed annually\nFluctuation in quarterly results. Our quarterly results have historically varied depending upon a variety of factors, including funding, readiness of projects and regulatory approvals. In addition, our contracts for large capital water treatment projects, systems and solutions for industrial, commercial and municipal applications are generally fixed-price contracts with milestone billings. As a result of these factors, our working capital requirements and demands on our distribution and delivery network may fluctuate during the year.\nInterest Expense-Interest expense increased $12.9 million, or 30.2%, to $55.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $42.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in borrowing in support of acquisitions, interest on capital leases and fees associated with our senior secured credit facilities.\nWe selectively target high value projects with opportunities for recurring business through service, parts and other aftermarket opportunities over the lifecycle of the process or capital equipment. In particular, we have developed a pipeline of smart, internet-connected monitoring technologies through the deployment of our Water One smart water platform that provides us with an increasing ability to\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of covenants imposing certain restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. The restrictions these covenants place on our business operations, include limitations on our or our subsidiaries' ability to:\nOther Operating Income, Net-Other operating income increased $6.9 million to $7.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $0.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in other operating income was primarily due to a gain on disposal of assets, including the Vernon Disposition.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider it appropriate for supplemental analysis. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.\nOperating expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing, general and administrative and research and development expenses.\n\nOur solutions are designed to provide \"worry-free water\" by ensuring that our customers have access to an uninterrupted quantity and level of quality of water that meets their unique product, process and recycle or reuse specifications. We enable our customers to achieve lower costs through greater uptime, throughput and efficiency in their operations and support their regulatory compliance and environmental sustainability. We have worked to protect water, the environment and our employees for over 100 years. As a result, we have earned a reputation for quality, safety and reliability and are sought out by our customers to solve the full range of their water treatment needs, and maintaining our reputation is critical to the success of our business and solution set.\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the term of the lease. Costs related to maintenance and repairs that do not extend the assets' useful life are expensed as incurred.\nAs of September 30, 2017, we had total indebtedness of $906.8 million, including $896.6 million of borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, no borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and $10.2 million in borrowings related to a BOO financing. We also had $6.7 million of letters of credit issued under our $95.0 million Revolving Credit Facility and an additional $10.6 million of letters of credit issued under a separate uncommitted facility as of September 30, 2017.\n\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for restructuring activities and other items impact reported cash flows.\n\u2022VAF-On July 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Valve and Filtration Systems, Ltd. (\"VAF\") for approximately $3.3 million, consisting of $2.7 million cash at closing and $0.6 million related to a $1.0 million maximum earnout payment subject to various performance metrics over the next five years. VAF is a leading screen filtration manufacturer based in Arvada, Colorado. VAF is included in the results of our Products Segment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview and Background\nWe apply ASC Topic 715, Compensation-Retirement Benefits, which requires the recognition in pension obligations and accumulated other comprehensive income of actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations that have previously been deferred. The determination of retirement benefit pension obligations and associated costs requires the use of actuarial computations to estimate participant plan benefits to which the employees will be entitled. The significant assumptions primarily relate to discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, mortality, years of service and other factors. We develop each assumption using relevant experience in conjunction with market-related data for each individual country in which such plans exist. All actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually with third-party consultants and adjusted as necessary. For the recognition of net periodic postretirement cost, the calculation of the expected return on plan assets is generally derived by applying the expected long-term rate of return on the market-related value of plan assets. The fair value of plan assets is determined based on actual market prices or estimated fair value at the measurement date.\nRevenues-Revenues increased $110.2 million, or 9.7%, to $1,247.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $1,137.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\nVarious trends and other factors affect or have affected our operating results, including:\nRevenues in the Municipal Segment increased slightly by $0.6 million, or 0.2%, to $278.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $278.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Excluding the operations in Italy, which we are in the process of closing and resulted in a decline of $1.6 million over the same period, the overall business grew by $2.2 million, or 0.8%. Excluding Italy, the aftermarket and services revenues are up 3.3% and 2.5% respectively, while capital revenues declined by 1.6%. Timing in capital was offset by growth in both the Municipal Services and wastewater and MEMCOR aftermarket revenues as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015, 2016 and 2017, our Industrial Segment accounted for 53.6%, 53.1% and 51.6% of our revenues, respectively; our Municipal Segment accounted for 25.8%, 24.4% and 22.3% of our revenues, respectively; and our Products Segment accounted for 20.6%, 22.5% and 26.1% of revenues, respectively.\n(a)We occupy certain facilities and operate certain equipment and vehicles under non-cancelable lease arrangements. Lease agreements may contain lease escalation clauses and purchase and renewal options. We recognize scheduled lease escalation clauses over the course of the applicable lease term on a straight-line basis.\nResearch and Development Expense-Research and development expenses decreased $3.0 million, or 11.6%, to $22.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $25.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Research and development expenses increased $0.2 million with the acquisition of Magneto and their extensive research and development programs related to anode coatings.\n\nWe believe that continuous improvement of our operations, processes and organizational structure is a key driver of our earnings growth. Since fiscal 2014, we have realigned our organizational structure, achieved significant cost savings through operational efficiencies and revitalized our culture, which has energized our workforce and reduced employee turnover. We have identified and are pursuing a number of discrete initiatives which, if successful, we expect could result in additional cost savings over the next three years. These initiatives include our ePro and supply chain improvement programs to consolidate and manage global spending, our improved logistics and transportation management program, further optimizing our engineering cost structure, capturing benefits of our Water One remote system monitoring and data analytics offerings. We refer to these initiatives as \"Value Creators\" as these improvements focus on creating value for customers through reduced leadtimes, improved quality and superior customer support, while also creating value for stockholders through enhanced earnings growth. Furthermore, as a result of significant investments we have made in our footprint and facilities, we have capacity to support our planned growth without commensurate increase in fixed costs.\nGovernment policies. Decaying water systems in the United States will require critical drinking water and wastewater repairs, often led by municipal governments. Further, as U.S. states increase regulation on existing and emerging contaminants, we expect that our customers will increasingly require sustainable solutions to their water-related needs. In general, increased infrastructure investment and more stringent municipal, state and federal regulations promote increased spending on our products, services and solutions, while a slowdown in investment in public infrastructure or the elimination of key environmental regulations could result in lower industrial and municipal spending on water systems and products.\nOther Operating Income (Expense), Net-Other operating income decreased $5.5 million, or 78.5%, to $1.5 million of income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $7.0 million of income in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we sold two locations, which resulted in a gain on sale. There were no similar transactions in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.\n\u2022 Accrued expenses and other liabilities used $2.2 million in operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 compared to a use of $31.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The use of operational cash flow in both periods resulted primarily from capital lease activity and timing of cash payments for various employee-related liabilities.\nFor certain arrangements where there is significant customization to the product, we recognize revenue under the provisions of ASC 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. These products include large capital water treatment projects, systems and solutions for municipal and industrial applications. Revenues from construction-type contracts are generally recognized under the percentage-of-completion method, based on the input of costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated contract costs. The nature of the contracts are generally fixed price with milestone billings. Approximately $203.1 million, $218.6 million and $240.2 million of revenues from construction-type contracts were recognized on the percentage-of-completion method during the periods ending September 30, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly at a minimum and the cumulative effect of such adjustments are recognized in current operations. The amounts of such adjustments have not been material.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)-Income tax expense decreased $66.3 million, or 138.4%, to an income tax benefit of $18.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from an expense of\nGeneral and Administrative Expense-General and administrative expenses increased $24.8 million, or 17.2%, to $169.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $144.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. This increase in general and administrative expenses was partially due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson, which accounted for $7.4 million of the increase. The balance of the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to costs associated with the Company's strategic transaction process of $8.1 million, costs related to restructuring and the integration of acquisitions of $3.9 million and expenses incurred related to other various strategic projects or initiatives of approximately $2.2 million.\nmaterials and components to the collection of cash from customers. Our cash conversion cycle can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period. Further, as it relates to capital projects, fiscal 2016 represented a continued rebuilding of the pipeline of capital projects as compared to the period prior to the Acquisition, which represented a depletion of the pipeline of capital projects. This build-up of capital project activity contributed to the variability of accounts receivable, inventories, excess billings on uncompleted contracts or billings in excess of costs incurred on uncompleted contracts from period to period.\nOverall economic trends. The overall economic environment and related changes in industrial, commercial and municipal spending impact our business. In general, positive conditions in the broader economy promote industrial, commercial and municipal customer spending, while economic weakness results in a reduction of new industrial, commercial and municipal project activity. Macroeconomic factors that can affect customer spending patterns, and thereby our results of operations, include population growth, total water consumption, municipal budgets, employment rates, business conditions, the availability of credit or capital, interest rates, tax rates and regulatory changes. Since the businesses of our customers vary in cyclicality, periodic downturns in any specific sector typically have modest impacts on our overall business.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses related to research and development, patents, sustaining engineering, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials and overhead costs allocated to such expenses. Substantially all of our research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving our existing products and services. To date, research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred, because the period between achieving technological feasibility and the release of products and services for sale has been short and development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.\n\nWe are a leading provider of mission critical water treatment solutions, offering services, systems and technologies to support our customers' full water lifecycle needs. With over 200,000 installations worldwide, we hold leading positions in the industrial, commercial and municipal water treatment markets in North America. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of differentiated, proprietary technology solutions sold under a number of market-leading and well-established brands. We deliver and maintain these mission critical solutions through the largest service network in North America assuring our customers continuous uptime with 86 branches which are located no further than a two-hour drive from more than 90% of our customers' sites. We believe that the customer intimacy created through our service network is a significant competitive advantage.\nEBITDA in the Industrial Segment increased $12.8 million, or 10.9%, to $129.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $116.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in EBITDA was primarily a result of the same factors which impacted operating profit in the Industrial Segment during this period. In addition, our ePro initiatives included a program to optimize fleet vehicles. This program resulted in a reduction to the fleet size, upgrades to vehicles to improve service technician productivity and conversion of the relevant contract from an operating lease to a capital lease resulting in a total increase to EBITDA of $6.8 million. These benefits were partially offset by the same factors affecting operating profit during this period.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6, \"Selected Financial and Operating Data\" and Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts in this section are referred to in thousands.\nThe increase in operating expense was primarily due to expenses associated with the acquired companies of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson, which accounted for $18.4 million of the operating expense increase. A discussion of operating expenses by category is as follows:\nEBITDA in the Industrial Segment increased $19.8 million, or 15.3%, to $149.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $129.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in EBITDA resulted from the same factors which impacted operating profit in the Industrial Segment during this period.\nKey Factors and Trends Affecting Our Business and Financial Statements\nResults of Operations\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin-Total gross margin increased to 29.3% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from 27.6% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015.\n\u2022 current business conditions and performance, including dispositions and discontinued operations;\nFiscal Years Ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016\nWe are a holding company and do not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock, if any, is dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our operating subsidiaries. Under the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, our operating subsidiaries are currently limited in their ability to pay cash dividends to us, and we expect these limitations to continue in the future under the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities of ours or of our subsidiaries.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue when an entity either enters into a contract with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into a contract for the transfer of non-financial assets. ASU 2014-09 may be adopted using either of two acceptable methods: (1) retrospective adoption to each prior period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients; or (2) adoption with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain disclosures. To assess at which time revenue should be recognized, an entity should use the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The standard is effective for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2018. At this time, we are not yet able to estimate the anticipated impact to our consolidated financial statements. We are also evaluating the new disclosures required by the standard to determine what additional information will need to be disclosed.\nAdjusted EBITDA-Adjusted EBITDA increased $47.6 million, or 29.7%, to $207.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $160.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Increased volume and benefits from restructuring and operational efficiencies that we implemented in the current and prior fiscal year provided $27.0 million of the increase in Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, revenue volume and profitability associated with prior year and current year acquisitions contributed approximately $20.6 million of the increase in Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is deemed more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within a reasonable time period. We assess tax positions using a two-step process. A tax position is recognized if it meets a more-likely-than-not threshold, and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% of being realized. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed each balance sheet date.\nSegment Results\nThe following table provides the change in cost of product sales and cost of services, respectively, along with related gross margins:\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $209.7 million from $344.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 to $134.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was largely driven by a reduction in the size of acquisitions completed during comparable periods. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 we spent $306.4 million to acquire Magneto, Neptune Benson, VAF and Delta. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we spent $77.8 million to acquire ETS, Noble, Olson and ADI. The reduction was partially offset by increased purchases of intangible assets and a sale of business that took place in the prior year.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of fixed overhead personnel expenses associated with our service organization (including district and branch managers, customer service, contract renewals and regeneration plant management). We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase due to the anticipated growth of our business and related infrastructure as well as legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations and other costs associated with becoming a public company.\n\u2022 Within the Municipal Segment, we primarily deliver solutions, equipment and services to engineering firms, OEMs and municipalities to treat wastewater and purify drinking water, and to control odor and corrosion.\nWe believe that tuck-in acquisitions present a key opportunity within our overall growth strategy, which we will continue to evaluate strategically. These strategic acquisitions will enable us to accelerate our growth in our current addressable market, as well as in new geographies and new end market verticals. Our existing customer relationships, best-in-class channels to market and ability to rapidly commercialize technologies provide a strong platform to drive rapid growth in the businesses we acquire. To capitalize on these opportunities, we have built an experienced team dedicated to mergers and acquisitions that has successfully completed eight technology-enhancing and geography-expanding acquisitions since April 2016, with purchase prices ranging from approximately $3.3 million to approximately $283.7 million, and pre-acquisition revenues ranging from approximately $3.1 million to approximately $55.7 million. We will continue to actively evaluate acquisition opportunities that are\n(iii)expenses associated with our information technology and functional infrastructure transformation following the Acquisition, including activities to optimize information technology systems and functional infrastructure processes for a standalone business ($12.1 million, primarily reflected as components of Cost of product sales and services ($3.0 million), Research and development expense ($0.4 million), Sales and marketing expense ($0.3 million) and General and administrative expense ($8.4 million) in fiscal 2015, $9.5 million, primarily reflected as components of Cost of product sales and services ($3.6 million), Sales and marketing expense ($2.5 million), General and administrative expense ($3.1 million) and Research and development expense ($0.3 million) in fiscal 2016 and $7.3 million, primarily reflected as components of Cost of product sales and services ($3.3 million), Sales and marketing expense ($1.5 million), and General and administrative expense ($2.5 million) in fiscal 2017); and\nManagement bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $197.7 million from $6.3 million of net cash used in financing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 to net cash provided by financing activities of $191.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily due to issuance of debt of $185.0 million under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities proceeds from capital contributions and issuance of common stock of approximately $17.2 million, both in support of acquisition activities.\nWe enter into long-term obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily debt obligations and non-cancelable operating leases. As of September 30, 2017, our contractual cash obligations over the next several periods were as follows (in thousands):\nmarkets in the Asia region driven by product sales of electrodeionization equipment, $3.8 million from the Wallace and Tiernan business, $3.7 million from capital sales in the separation technologies product line, and $3.4 million from stronger sales of aquatic filters in the Americas region. The Municipal aftermarket business increased by $1.8 million predominantly in North America through both wastewater and MEMCOR. These revenue increases were offset by lower sales volumes in capital projects driving a decline of $2.0 million in revenues related to large project timing in both North America & United Kingdom, and $1.6 million of revenue decline related to our Italian operations in the year ended September 30, 2016 that did not reoccur due to the wind down of our operations in that geographic area.\n\n(b)We lease certain equipment classified as capital leases. The leased equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis over the life of the lease and is included in depreciation expense.\nOperating profit in the Products Segment increased $11.2 million, or 29.8%, to $48.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $37.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to the Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV and Magneto acquisitions. The declines in operating profit in the electrochlorination, dewatering and intake product lines were offset by increases in the IonPure product line with our expansion in China.\nof short-term service arrangements are recognized as the services are performed, and sales of long-term service arrangements are typically recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreement.\nRevenue Recognition\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased to $28.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $31.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.\n(d)Represents management fees paid to AEA pursuant to the management agreement. Pursuant to the management agreement, AEA provided advisory and consulting services to us in connection with the Acquisition, including investment banking, due diligence, financial advisory and valuation services. AEA also provided ongoing advisory and consulting services (similar in nature to the services provided in connection with the Acquisition) to us pursuant to the management agreement. In connection with the initial public offering, the management agreement was terminated. See Item 13, \"Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Director Independence\" and Note 18, \"Related-Party Transactions\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail.\n(i)costs and expenses in connection with various restructuring initiatives since the Acquisition, including severance costs, relocation costs, recruiting expenses, write-offs of inventory and fixed assets and third-party consultant costs to assist with these initiatives (includes (A) $16.9 million in fiscal 2016 (all of which is reflected as a component of Restructuring charges in Note 12, \"Restructuring and Related Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and $20.1 million in fiscal 2017 (all of which is reflected as a component of Restructuring charges in Note 12, \"Restructuring and Related Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) related to our voluntary separation plan pursuant to which approximately 220 employees accepted separation packages, and (B) $9.2 million (of which $6.5 million is reflected as a component of Restructuring charges in Note 12, \"Restructuring and Related Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) in fiscal 2015, $11.1 million (all of which is reflected as a component of Restructuring charges in Note 12, \"Restructuring and Related Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) in fiscal 2016 and $13.2 million (of which $12.3 million is reflected as a component of Restructuring charges in Note 12, \"Restructuring and Related Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) in fiscal 2017 related to various other initiatives implemented to restructure and reorganize our business with the appropriate management team and cost structure). Differences between amounts reflected as Restructuring charges in Note 12, \"Restructuring and Related Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and amounts reflected in this adjustment also relate to retention payments made to employees in fiscal 2015 of $2.5 million that have been reflected as components of Cost of product sales and services ($1.1 million), Research and development expense ($0.1 million), Sales and marketing expense ($1.0 million) and General and administrative expense ($0.3 million). Differences between amounts reflected as Restructuring charges in Note 12, \"Restructuring and Related Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 and amounts reflected in this adjustment relate primarily to impairment charges related to assets in our Italy operations that have been reflected as a component of Cost of product sales and services ($0.9 million);\n\u2022 lack of marketability of our common stock; and\nAcquisitions\nThe following table summarizes the changes to our cash flows for the periods presented:\n\n\u2022 to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.\nDebt refinancings. In October 2016, we repaid our senior secured second lien term loan facility in full and revolving credit loans then-outstanding and borrowed an additional $150.0 million of term loans under our term loan facility at lower rates.\n\u2022 sales of products, services and solutions to engineering firms and municipalities to purify drinking water and treat wastewater globally; and\n(f)Represents:\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nReceivables are primarily comprised of uncollected amounts owed to us from transactions with customers and are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts. Allowances are estimated based on historical write-offs and the economic status of customers. We consider a receivable delinquent if it is unpaid after the term of the related invoice has expired. Write-offs are recorded at the time all collection efforts have been exhausted.\nApproximately $29.7 million, $33.5 million and $28.4 million of revenues from construction-type contracts were recognized on a completed contract method, which is typically when the product is delivered and accepted by the customer, during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The completed contract method is principally used when the contract is short in duration (generally less than twelve months) and where results of operations would not vary materially from those resulting from the use of the percentage-of-completion method. Cost and earnings in excess of billings under construction-type arrangements are recorded when contracts have net asset balances where contract costs plus recognized profits less recognized losses exceed progress billings. Billings in excess of costs incurred are recorded when contract progress billings exceed costs and recognized profit less recognized losses.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounts Receivable\n\u2022 The aggregate of receivables, inventories, cost and earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts, accounts payable and billings in excess of costs incurred on uncompleted contracts used $14.5 million in operating cash flows in fiscal 2016 compared to $19.9 million of operating cash flows provided in fiscal 2015. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the above mentioned accounts depends upon how effectively we manage our cash conversion cycle, which is a representation of the number of days that elapse from the date of purchase of raw\nWe evaluate our business segments' operating results based on income from operations and EBITDA on a segment basis. Corporate activities include general corporate expenses, elimination of intersegment transactions, interest income and expense and other unallocated charges, which have not been allocated to business segments. As such, the segment results provided herein may not be comparable to other companies.\nAs of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2017, we had letters of credit totaling $18.1 million and $17.2 million, respectively, and surety bonds totaling $102.2 million and $87.8 million respectively, outstanding under our credit arrangements. The longest maturity date of the letters of credit and surety bonds in effect as of September 30, 2017 was March 31, 2024. Additionally, as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2017, we had letters of credit totaling $1.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, and surety bonds totaling $43.7 million and $13.0 million, respectively, outstanding under our prior arrangement with Siemens.\nNet Income (Loss)\n\u2022 in our management incentive compensation which is based in part on components of Adjusted EBITDA;\n(iv)expenses related to maintaining non-operational business locations ($7.4 million in fiscal 2015, $1.8 million in fiscal 2016 and $1.9 million in fiscal 2017).\nProduct and Technology Development\n(1)Interest expense and Income tax expense (benefit) are corporate activities that are not allocated to our three reportable segments.\nOperating profit in the Industrial Segment increased $5.1 million, or 5.9%, to $91.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $86.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to increased volume of $5.8 million. Additionally, as part of the Value Creator program we initiated ePro activities, which resulted in a reduction to costs of $1.8 million and operational improvements in supply chain that resulted in reduced warranty expense and liabilities of $1.6 million. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable product mix of $4.3 million driven by large capital revenue that carries lower margins.\nRevenues in the Products Segment increased $70.4 million, or 27.6%, to $325.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $255.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in revenues was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto and Olson. These acquisitions accounted for an aggregate of $48.7 million of the increased revenues. The Products Segment also increased revenues in the amount of $9.2 million in our power and microelectronics markets. These increases were principally due to higher product sales of electrodeionization equipment in our legal entity in China. Additionally, there were increases of $7.7 million due to growth in the aquatics and disinfection division and $3.7 million from stronger capital sales.\nContractual Obligations\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued (ASU) 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. The ASU includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. ASU No. 2016 09 will be effective for us for the quarter ending December 31, 2017. We do not expect the implementation of this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOperational investment. Our historical operating results reflect the impact of our ongoing investments to support our growth. We have made significant investments in our business that we believe have laid the foundation for continued profitable growth. We believe that our strengthened sales force, mergers and acquisitions team, enhanced information systems, research, development and engineering investments and other factors enable us to support our operating model.\n\u2022ADI-On June 30, 2017, we completed the acquisition of ADI Systems North America Inc., Geomembrane Technologies Inc. and Lange Containment Systems, Inc. (collectively \"ADI\"), a leader in anaerobic digestion, aerobic treatment and biogas treatment, green energy recovery and water reuse technologies, as well as industrial wastewater cover liners and containment systems for a base purchase price of CAD 72.2 million (or approximately $55.6 million), of which CAD 67.3 million ($51.8 million) in cash was paid at closing and included the fair value of the earnout payments of CAD 4.9 million ($3.8 million). The maximum earnout payment of CAD 7.5 million (or approximately $5.8 million), is payable over a period of twenty-four months based upon the achievement of certain specified performance metrics. ADI is included in the results of our Industrial Segment.\nIn August 2017, we completed an incremental financing of $80.0 million. In this transaction we combined the incremental debt tranche of approximately $183 million associated with the Neptune Benson acquisition, along with the new borrowings of $80 million into our existing first lien term loan tranche a lower interest rate. Proceeds from the incremental financing were used to repay $60 million of revolving credit facility borrowings and the remainder was placed on the balance sheet for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions. We have the option to add one or more incremental term loans under our term loan facility or revolving credit facilities or increase commitments under our revolving credit facility. Further, our revolving credit facility and term loan facility are scheduled to mature in January 2019 and January 2021, respectively, and we will need to repay, refinance, replace or otherwise extend the maturity of our senior secured credit facilities. Accordingly, our results have been and will be impacted by substantial changes in our net interest expense throughout the periods presented and in the future. See \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below.\n\u2022 sales of tailored light industry technologies, heavy industry technologies and environmental products, services and solutions in collaboration with our industrial customers, backed by lifecycle services including emergency response services and build-own-operate alternatives, to a broad group of industrial customers in our U.S., Canada and Singapore markets;\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash generated by operating activities and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). Historically, we have financed our operations primarily from cash generated from operations and periodic borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our primary cash needs are for day to day operations, to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness, to fund working capital requirements and to make capital expenditures.\n\u2022 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\nconsistent with our business strategy and financial model, and, although we may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets and implement our growth strategy, we currently have a pipeline which includes more than 60 potential targets, which has been developed proactively by our team as well as informed by our customer base. Our acquisitions include:\nfrom operations, together with borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are sufficient to fund our principal debt payments, interest expense, our working capital needs and our expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months. Our capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 were $57.8 million. However, our budgeted capital expenditures can vary from period to period based on the nature of capital intensive project awards. We may draw on our Revolving Credit Facility from time to time to fund or partially fund an acquisition.\nSales of goods and services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered.\nOperating Expenses\nRevenues from product sales increased $87.9 million, or 15%, to $675.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from $587.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in product revenues was primarily due to the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto, ETS, Noble, ADI and Olson, which accounted for $68.1 million. The remaining increase was related to organic revenue growth of approximately $8.6 million in the power and microelectronics\nMunicipal\nCost of services increased approximately $13.5 million in the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2015. This was commensurate with the increase in revenue volume, offset by the beneficial impact of various restructuring initiatives put in place over the previous period.\nChanges in costs. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, including steel, caustic, carbon, calcium nitrate and iridium, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross profit and gross margin. Further, additional potential acquisitions and international expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial, administrative and other resources. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance our management systems, financial and management controls and information systems. We will also be required to hire, train and retain operational and sales personnel, which affects our operating margins.\nWe review goodwill to determine potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting unit level. We have determined that we have four reporting units. Our quantitative impairment testing utilizes both a market (guideline public company) and income (discounted cash flows) method for determining fair value. In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation technique, we incorporate our judgment and estimates of future cash flows, future revenue and gross profit growth rates, terminal value amount, capital expenditures and applicable weighted-average cost of capital used to discount these estimated cash flows. The estimates and projections used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with our current budget and long-range plans, including anticipated change in market conditions, industry trend, growth rates and planned capital expenditures, among other considerations. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value, the second step is performed, where the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value.\n\u2022 make certain investments;\nConsolidated Results\n\u2022 Operating cash flows in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 reflected an increase in net income of $99.1 million from fiscal 2015. Net income in fiscal 2016 included a benefit from the relief of the income tax valuation allowance of $15.4 million compared to establishing an income tax valuation allowance of $63.3 million in fiscal 2015. Additionally in fiscal 2016, net income included the non-cash impact of foreign currency losses for intracompany loans primarily denominated in euro of $0.1 million compared to $19.3 million in fiscal 2015.\nOperating profit in the Products Segment increased $17.2 million, or 35.3%, to $65.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 from the $48.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to the additional revenue volume and profitability associated with the acquisitions of Neptune-Benson, VAF, Delta UV, Magneto and Olson. These acquisitions accounted for $10.1 million of the operating profit increase in the year ended September 30 2017. The aquatics and disinfection division saw operating profit grow $4.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. Operating profit in the electrodeionization equipment product lines also improved due to the increased revenues of $5.8 million in the Asia region, which accounted for $1.6 million in additional operating profit. Lastly, operating profit in the marine end markets improved $1.1 million.\nIn addition, our Revolving Credit Facility, but not the Term Loan Facility, contains a financial covenant which requires us to comply with the maximum first lien net leverage ratio of 5.55 to 1.00 as of the last day of any quarter on which the aggregate amount of revolving loans and letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility (net of cash collateralized letters of credit and undrawn outstanding letters of credit in an amount of up to 50% of the Revolving Credit Facility) exceeds 25% of the total commitments thereunder.\nRevenues in the Municipal Segment increased $4.4 million, or 1.6%, to $278.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 from $273.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in revenues was primarily due to volume sold in both our service business, through geographical expansion and new product rollouts delivering $6.6 million increase from the prior year, and growth in aftermarket $6.4 million. This is offsetting a decline of $4.5 million in capital due project\nOperational Excellence", "item_7_tables": "Table 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
