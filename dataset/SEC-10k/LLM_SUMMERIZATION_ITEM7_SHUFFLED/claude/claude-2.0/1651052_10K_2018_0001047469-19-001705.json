The information in this section contains forward-looking statements. Please read \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" Our actual results may differ significantly from the results suggested by these forward-looking statements and from our historical results. Some factors that may cause our results to differ are described in \"Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\" The historical financial data discussed below reflects the historical results of operations and financial position of Focus Inc., including consolidation of its investment in Focus LLC, since July 30, 2018. Prior to July 30, 2018, the closing date of the IPO, the historical financial data discussed below represents the historical results of operations and financial position of Focus LLC.\nOverview\nWe are a leading partnership of independent, fiduciary wealth management firms operating in the highly fragmented RIA industry, with a footprint of 60 partner firms primarily in the United States. We have achieved this market leadership by positioning ourselves as the partner of choice for many firms in an industry where a number of secular trends are driving RIA consolidation. Our partner firms primarily service ultra-high net worth and high net worth individuals and families by providing highly differentiated and comprehensive wealth management services. Our partner firms benefit from our intellectual and financial resources, operating in a scaled business model with aligned interests, while retaining their entrepreneurial culture and independence.\nOur partnership is comprised of trusted professionals providing comprehensive wealth management services under a largely recurring, fee-based model, which differentiates our partner firms from the traditional brokerage platforms whose revenues are largely derived from commissions. We derive a substantial majority of our revenues from wealth management fees for investment advice, financial and tax planning, consulting, tax return preparation, family office services and other services. We also generate other revenues primarily from recordkeeping and administration service fees, commissions and distribution fees and outsourced services.\nSince we began revenue-generating and acquisition activities in 2006, we have created a partnership of 60 partner firms, the substantial majority of which are RIAs registered with the SEC and built a business with revenues of $910.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, in excess of 95% of our revenues were fee-based and recurring in nature. We have established a national footprint across the United States and expanded our international footprint into the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.\nSources of Revenue\nOur partner firms provide comprehensive wealth management services under a largely recurring, fee-based model. We, solely through our partner firms, derive a substantial majority of our revenue from wealth management fees, which are comprised of fees earned from wealth management services, including investment advice, financial and tax planning, consulting, tax return preparation, family office services and other services. Fees are primarily based either on a contractual percentage of the client's assets, a flat fee, an hourly rate or a combination of such fees and are billed either in advance or arrears on a monthly, quarterly or semiannual basis. In certain cases, such wealth management fees may be subject to minimum fee levels depending on the services performed. We also generate other revenues, which primarily include recordkeeping and administration service fees, commissions and distribution fees and outsourced services. The following table summarizes our sources of revenue:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2018 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Revenues </th> <th> </th> <th>% of Total\nRevenues </th> <th> </th> <th>Revenues </th> <th> </th> <th>% of Total\nRevenues </th> <th> </th> <th>Revenues </th> <th> </th> <th>% of Total\nRevenues </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wealth management fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>438,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>617,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>853,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>45,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>57,847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>485,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>662,887 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>910,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, our wealth management fees were impacted by the acquisitions of new partner firms and the growth of existing partner firms, which includes the acquisitions of wealth management practices and customer lists by our existing partner firms. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, we completed acquisitions of six, ten and eight partner firms, respectively. In 2016, the new partner firms were Douglas Lane & Associates, Kovitz Investment Group Partners, Waddell & Associates, Carnick & Kubik Group, GYL Financial Synergies and XML Financial Group. In 2017, the new partner firms were Crestwood Advisors, CFO4Life, One Charles Private Wealth, Bordeaux Wealth Advisors, Gelfand, Rennert & Feldman, Lake Street Advisors, Financial Professionals, SCS Financial Services, Brownlie & Braden and Eton Advisors. In 2018, the new partner firms were Cornerstone Wealth, Fortem Financial, Bartlett Wealth Management, Campbell Deegan Financial, Nigro Karlin Segal Feldstein & Bolno, Asset Advisors Investment Management, Edge Capital Group and Vista Wealth Management.\nIn 2016, 2017 and 2018, our partner firms completed 12, 15 and 17 transactions, respectively, consisting of business acquisitions accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 805: Business Combinations and asset acquisitions.\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our acquisitions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, in excess of 95% of our revenues were fee-based and recurring in nature. Although the substantial majority of our revenues are fee-based and recurring, our revenues can fluctuate due to macroeconomic factors and the overall state of the financial markets, particularly in the United States. Our partner firms' wealth management fees are primarily based either on a contractual percentage of the client's assets, a flat fee, an hourly rate or a combination of such fees and are billed either in advance or arrears on a monthly, quarterly or semiannual basis. Because of the variety of billing practices across our partner firms, there is no direct correlation between short-term financial market movements and total revenues. Additionally, we estimate that approximately 23% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were not directly correlated to the financial markets. Longer term trends in the financial markets may favorably or unfavorably impact our total revenues, but not in a linear relationship. For example, during 2016, 2017 and 2018,\nthe Standard & Poor's 500 Index had a total return of 12.0%, 21.8% and (4.4)%, respectively, and the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index had a total return for the same periods of 2.6%, 3.5% and 0.0%, respectively. By comparison, for the same periods our organic revenue growth was 5.2%, 13.4% and 13.0%, respectively. For additional information, please read \"-How We Evaluate our Business.\"\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of compensation and related expenses, management fees, selling, general and administrative expenses, intangible amortization, non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration and depreciation and other amortization expense.\nCompensation and Related Expenses\nCompensation and related expenses include salaries, wages, related employee benefits and taxes for employees at our partner firms and employees at the Focus LLC company level. Compensation and related expenses also include non-cash compensation expense, associated with both Focus Inc.'s and Focus LLC's equity grants to employees and non-employees, including management company principals.\nManagement Fees\nWhile we have to date, with limited exceptions, acquired substantially all of the assets of a target firm, following our acquisition of a new partner firm, the partner firm continues to be primarily managed by its principals through their 100% ownership of a new management company formed by them concurrently with the acquisition. Our operating subsidiary, the management company and the principals enter into a management agreement that provides for the payment of ongoing management fees to the management company. The terms of the management agreements are generally six years subject to automatic renewals for consecutive one-year terms, unless earlier terminated by either the management company or us in certain limited situations. Under the management agreement, the management company is entitled to management fees typically consisting of all EBPC in excess of Base Earnings up to Target Earnings, plus a percentage of EBPC in excess of Target Earnings.\nWe retain a cumulative preferred position in Base Earnings. To the extent earnings of an acquired business in any year are less than Base Earnings, in the following year we are entitled to receive Base Earnings together with the prior years' shortfall before any management fees are earned by the management company.\nThe following table provides an illustrative example of our economics, including management fees earned by the management company, for periods of projected revenues, +10% growth in revenues and -10% growth in revenues. This example assumes (i) Target Earnings of $3.0 million; (ii) Base Earnings\nacquired of 60% of Target Earnings or $1.8 million; and (iii) a percentage of earnings in excess of Target Earnings retained by the management company of 40%.\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Projected\nRevenues </th> <th> </th> <th>+10%\nGrowth in\nRevenues </th> <th> </th> <th>-10% Growth\nin Revenues </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New Partner Firm\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> New partner firm revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>5,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>5,500 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>4,500 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Less:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Operating expenses (excluding management fees)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> EBPC\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>3,000 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>3,500 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,500 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Base Earnings to Focus Inc.

The contingent consideration is paid upon the satisfaction of specified growth thresholds typically over a six-year period. This arrangement may result in the payment of additional purchase price consideration to the sellers for periods following the closing of an acquisition. The growth thresholds are typically tied to CAGR of the partner firm's earnings. Earn out payments are typically payable in cash and, in some cases, equity.\nFor business acquisitions, we recognize the fair value of estimated contingent consideration at the acquisition date as part of the consideration transferred in exchange for substantially all of the assets of the wealth management firm. The contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each\nreporting date until the contingency is resolved. Any changes in fair value are recognized each reporting period in non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration in our consolidated statements of operations.\nDepreciation and Other Amortization\nDepreciation and other amortization expense primarily represents the benefits we received from using long-lived assets such as computers and equipment, leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures. Those assets primarily consist of purchased fixed assets as well as fixed assets acquired through our acquisitions.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nWe completed 12, 23 and 19 business acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, consisting of both new partner firms and acquisitions by our partner firms. Such business acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805: Business Combinations.\nThe purchase price is comprised of a base purchase price and a right to receive contingent consideration in the form of earn out payments. The base purchase price typically consists of an upfront cash payment and may include equity. The contingent consideration generally consists of earn outs over a six year period following the closing, with payment upon the satisfaction of specified growth thresholds. The growth thresholds are typically tied to the CAGR of the partner firm's earnings. The contingent consideration is typically payable in cash and, in some cases, equity.\nThe following table summarizes our business acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2018 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of business acquisitions closed\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consideration:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash due at closing and option premium\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>163,067 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>362,524 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>408,478 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash due subsequent to closing at net present value and estimated working capital adjustment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,134 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair market value of Focus LLC common units issued\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,456 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair market value of Class A common stock issued\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112,461 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair market value of estimated contingent consideration\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,086 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total consideration\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>220,854 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>464,991 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>653,615 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we completed six, two and six acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, that did not meet the definition of a business under ASC Topic 805: Business Combinations. These acquisitions primarily related to the acquisition of customer lists.\nSubstantially all of our acquisitions have been paid for with a combination of cash flow from operations, proceeds from the IPO, proceeds from borrowings under the Credit Facility and equity, valued at the then-fair market value.\nRecent Developments\nFrom January 1, 2019 to the date of this Annual Report, we completed 12 business acquisitions (accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805: Business Combinations) consisting of both new partner firms and acquisitions by our partner firms. The Acquired Base Earnings associated with the acquisition of the new partner firms during this period was approximately $11.9 million. Furthermore, we have signed definitive purchase agreements to acquire an additional two new partner firms with\nassociated Acquired Base Earnings of approximately $6.3 million. Each of these pending transactions is generally on terms and in a structure consistent with past transactions, and the closings are subject to customary closing conditions.

We believe these growth statistics are useful in that they present full-period revenue growth of partner firms on a \"same store\" basis exclusive of the effect of the partial results of partner firms that are acquired during the comparable periods.\n(3)The terms of our management agreements entitle the management companies to management fees typically consisting of all EBPC in excess of Base Earnings up to Target Earnings, plus a\npercentage of any EBPC in excess of Target Earnings. Management fees growth represents the period-over-period growth in GAAP management fees earned by management companies. While an expense, we believe that growth in management fees reflect the strength of the partnership.\n(4)Organic management fees growth represents the period-over-period growth in management fees earned by management companies related to partner firms, including growth related to acquisitions of wealth management practices and customer relationships by our partner firms and partner firms that have merged, that for the entire periods presented, are included in our consolidated statements of operations for each of the entire periods presented. We believe that these growth statistics are useful in that they present full-period growth of management fees on a \"same store\" basis exclusive of the effect of the partial period results of partner firms that are acquired during the comparable periods.\n(5)For additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share and Adjusted Shares Outstanding, including a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please read \"-Adjusted EBITDA\" and \"-Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share.\"\n(6)The terms of our management agreements entitle the management companies to management fees typically consisting of all future EBPC of the acquired wealth management firm in excess of Base Earnings up to Target Earnings, plus a percentage of any EBPC in excess of Target Earnings. Acquired Base Earnings is equal to our retained cumulative preferred position in Base Earnings. We are entitled to receive these earnings notwithstanding any earnings that we are entitled to receive in excess of Target Earnings. Base Earnings may change in future periods for various business or contractual matters. For example, from time to time when a partner firm consummates an acquisition, the management agreement among the partner firm, the management company and the principals is amended to adjust Base Earnings and Target Earnings to reflect the projected post-acquisition earnings of the partner firm.\n(7)Represents the number of partner firms on the last day of the period presented. The number includes new partner firms acquired during the period reduced by any partner firms that merged with existing partner firms prior to the last day of the period.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) excluding interest income, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), amortization of debt financing costs, intangible amortization and impairments, if any, depreciation and other amortization, non-cash equity compensation expense, non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration, gain on sale of investment, loss on extinguishment of borrowings, other expense/income, net, delayed offering cost expense, other one-time transaction expenses, and management contract buyout, if any. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of, our reported GAAP results, provides additional useful information to investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations for various reasons, including the following:\n\u2022 non-cash equity grants made to employees or non-employees at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time; stock-based compensation expense is not a key measure of our operating performance;\n\u2022 contingent consideration or earn outs can vary substantially from company to company and depending upon each company's growth metrics and accounting assumption methods; the non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration is not considered a key measure in comparing our operating performance; and\n\u2022 amortization expenses can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon each company's financing and accounting methods, the fair value and average expected life of acquired intangible assets and the method by which assets were acquired; the amortization of intangible assets obtained in acquisitions are not considered a key measure in comparing our operating performance.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA:\n\u2022 as a measure of operating performance;\n\u2022 for planning purposes, including the preparation of budgets and forecasts;\n\u2022 to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business;\n\u2022 to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; and\n\u2022 as a consideration in determining compensation for certain employees.\nAdjusted EBITDA does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities. The term Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss), operating income or any other performance or liquidity measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense on our debt or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments.\nIn addition, Adjusted EBITDA can differ significantly from company to company depending on strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. We compensate for these limitations by relying also on the GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental information.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018:\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2018 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>15,722 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(48,359 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(41,087 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(88 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(222 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,266 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,448 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,501 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>9,450 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of debt financing costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,482 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,498 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intangible amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,942 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and other amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,370 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash equity compensation expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,468 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,143 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>22,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,638 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of investment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,509 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of borrowings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,071 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense (income), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,385 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>3,191 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,350 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Delayed offering cost expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other one-time transaction expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,590 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>103,038 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>145,226 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>203,402 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share\nWe analyze our performance using Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share are non-GAAP measures. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss) excluding income tax expense (benefit), amortization of debt financing costs, intangible amortization and impairments, if any, non-cash equity compensation expense, non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration, gain on sale of investment, loss on extinguishment of borrowings, delayed offering cost expense, management contract buyout, if any, and other one-time transaction expenses. The calculation of Adjusted Net Income also includes adjustments to reflect (i) a pro forma 27% income tax rate assuming all earnings of Focus LLC were recognized by Focus Inc. and no earnings were attributable to non-controlling interests and (ii) tax adjustments from intangible asset related income tax benefits from acquisitions based on a pro forma 27% tax rate.\nAdjusted Net Income Per Share for the year ended December 31, 2018 is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the Adjusted Shares Outstanding. Adjusted Shares Outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes: (i) the weighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period, (ii) the weighted average incremental shares of Class A common stock related to stock options and unvested Class A common stock outstanding during the period, (iii) the weighted average number of Focus LLC common units outstanding during the period (assuming that 100% of such Focus LLC common units have been exchanged for Class A common stock) and (iv) the weighted average number of common unit equivalents of Focus LLC vested and unvested incentive units outstanding during the period based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on the last trading day of the period (assuming that 100% of such Focus LLC common units have been exchanged for Class A common stock).\nAdjusted Net Income Per Share for the periods prior to July 30, 2018 is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the Adjusted Shares Outstanding. Adjusted Shares Outstanding for the periods prior to July 30, 2018 was 71,843,916 and includes all vested and unvested shares of Class A common stock issued in connection with the IPO and Reorganization Transactions, assumes that all\nvested non-compensatory stock options and unvested compensatory stock options outstanding at the closing of the IPO have been exercised (assuming vesting of unvested compensatory stock options and a then-current value of the Class A common stock equal to the $33.00 IPO price) and assumes that 100% of the Focus LLC common units and vested and unvested incentive units outstanding at the closing of the IPO have been exchanged for Class A common stock (assuming vesting of the unvested incentive units and a then-current value of the Focus LLC common units equal to the $33.00 IPO price).\nWe believe that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of, our reported GAAP results, provide additional useful information to investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations for various reasons, including the following:\n\u2022 non-cash equity grants made to employees or non-employees at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time; stock-based compensation expense is not a key measure of our operating performance;\n\u2022 contingent consideration or earn outs can vary substantially from company to company and depending upon each company's growth metrics and accounting assumption methods; the non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration is not considered a key measure in comparing our operating performance; and\n\u2022 amortization expenses can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon each company's financing and accounting methods, the fair value and average expected life of acquired intangible assets and the method by which assets were acquired; the amortization of intangible assets obtained in acquisitions are not considered a key measure in comparing our operating performance.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share do not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities.

related to (a) Q4 2018 Loring Ward severance cash compensation of $507, which was recorded in compensation and related expenses, and Q3 2018 IPO and Reorganization Transaction cash compensation expenses of $5,926, which were recorded in compensation and related expenses, (b) transaction expenses of $1,762, which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, associated with the acquisition of Loring Ward, of which $1,114 were incurred in Q4 2018 and $648 were incurred in Q3 2018 and (c) Q4 2018 other expenses, net of $2,373, which were recorded in other (expense) income-net, primarily related to the loss on sale of a tax customer list and related receivables. In 2017, relates to one-time transaction expenses, which were recorded in other (expense) income-net, related to insurance fees associated with the investment by our private equity investors.\n(2)For periods ended prior to the closing of the IPO and the consummation of the Reorganization Transactions on July 30, 2018, certain tax related adjustments are being made for comparative purposes only.\n(3)As of December 31, 2018, the estimated tax adjustments from intangible asset related income tax benefits from closed acquisitions based on a pro forma 27% tax rate for the next 12 months is approximately $25,171.\n(4)For periods ended prior to the closing of the IPO and the consummation of the Reorganization Transactions on July 30, 2018, the Adjusted Shares Outstanding are deemed to be outstanding for comparative purposes only.\n(5)Represents our GAAP weighted average Class A common stock outstanding-basic.\n(6)The issuance of Class A common stock that occurred upon closing of the IPO and the consummation of the Reorganization Transactions on July 30, 2018 is assumed to have occurred as of January 1, 2016 for comparative purposes.\n(7)The incremental shares for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to stock options and unvested Class A common stock as calculated using the treasury stock method were not included in the calculation of weighted average shares of Class A common stock-diluted as the result would have been anti-dilutive.\n(8)Assumes that 100% of the Focus LLC common units were exchanged for Class A common stock.\n(9)Assumes that 100% of the vested and unvested Focus LLC incentive units were converted into Focus LLC common units based on the closing price of our Class A common stock at the end of the respective period and such Focus LLC common units were exchanged for Class A common stock. For the periods ending prior to July 30, 2018, the conversion to Focus LLC common units was based on the $33.00 IPO price.\nFactors Affecting Comparability\nOur future results of operations may not be comparable to our historical results of operations, principally for the following reasons:\nTax Treatment\nAs a flow-through entity, Focus LLC is generally not and has not been subject to U.S. federal and certain state income taxes at the entity level, although it has been subject to the New York City Unincorporated Business Tax. Instead, for U.S. federal and certain state income tax purposes, taxable income was and is passed through to its unitholders, which, after the IPO on July 30, 2018, now includes Focus Inc. Focus Inc. is subject to U.S. federal and certain state income taxes applicable to corporations. Accordingly, our effective tax rate, and the absolute dollar amount of our tax expense, has increased as a result of the IPO.\nPublic Company Expenses\nWe expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of being a publicly traded company, including annual and quarterly report preparation, tax return preparation, independent auditor fees, investor relations activities, transfer agent fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and independent director compensation. We also expect our accounting, legal, tax and personnel-related expenses to increase as we supplement our compliance and governance functions, maintain and review internal controls over financial reporting and prepare and distribute periodic reports as required by the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following discussion presents an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017.

December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. New partner firms added during the year ended December 31, 2017 were Crestwood Advisors, CFO4Life, One Charles Private Wealth, Bordeaux Wealth Advisors, Gelfand Rennert & Feldman, Lake Street Advisors, Financial Professionals, SCS Financial Services, Brownlie & Braden and Eton Advisors. These new partner firms contributed approximately $102.5 million in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017. The balance of the increase of $75.8 million was due to the revenue growth at our existing partner firms associated with\nwealth management services and partner firm-level acquisitions and a full period of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther revenue decreased $0.9 million, or 1.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily related to lower commissions and distribution fees.\nOperating Expenses\nCompensation and related expenses increased $87.4 million, or 49.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase related to new partner firms was $40.2 million. The balance of the increase of $47.2 million was due to an increase in salaries and related expense, in part the result of a full year of expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016 and an increase of $26.4 million in non-cash equity compensation expense primarily related to the recognition of expense associated with the modification and vesting of certain Focus LLC common units and incentive units.\nManagement fees increased $48.8 million, or 42.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase related to new partner firms was $19.3 million. Management fees are variable and a function of earnings during the period. The balance of the increase of $29.5 million was due to the increase in earnings during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, in part the result of a full year of earnings recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $36.0 million, or 36.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase related to the new partner firms was $14.1 million. The balance of the increase of $21.9 million was in part the result of a full year of expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016 and in part due to an increase in expenses related to professional fees, travel, marketing and information technology expenses related to the growth of our existing partner firms and our acquisition of new partner firms, as well as the $9.8 million in delayed offering cost expense.\nIntangible amortization increased $13.4 million, or 26.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. New partner firms added amortization of $13.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNon-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration increased $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was the result of the increase in the probability that certain contingent consideration payments would be achieved, resulting in an increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDepreciation and other amortization expense increased $1.0 million, or 17.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due primarily to acquisitions and capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, a loss on extinguishment of borrowings of $8.1 million was recognized in connection with the Credit Facility.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense decreased $2.5 million, or 253.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in income tax expense is primarily related to the remeasurement of certain of our deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2017, based on the reduction in the tax rate at which they are expected to reverse. Such remeasurement resulted in an income tax benefit of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe following discussion presents an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018.

the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. New partner firms added subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2017 that are included in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 include Cornerstone Wealth, Fortem Financial, Bartlett Wealth Management, Campbell Deegan Financial, Nigro Karlin Segal Feldstein & Bolno, Asset Advisors Investment Management, Edge Capital Group and Vista Wealth Management. These new partner firms contributed approximately $95.3 million in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. The balance of the increase of $140.6 million was due to the revenue growth at our existing partner firms associated with wealth management services and partner firm-level acquisitions and a full period of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther revenues increased $12.1 million, or 26.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is due primarily to $10.4 million from 2018 new partner firms principally related to outsourced services revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nCompensation and related expenses increased $92.5 million, or 34.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase related to new partner firms was $35.7 million. The balance of the increase of $56.8 million was due to an increase of $47.2 million in salaries and related expense, in part the result of a full period of expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017 and an increase of $9.6 million in non-cash compensation expense primarily related to the recognition of expenses associated with the modification and vesting of certain Focus LLC common units and incentive units.\nManagement fees increased $69.1 million, or 42.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase related to the new partner firms was $26.0 million. Management fees are variable and a function of earnings during the period. The balance of the increase of $43.1 million was due to the increase in earnings during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, in part the result of a full period of earnings recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017 as well as new partner promotions.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $35.7 million, or 26.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase related to new partner firms was $16.7 million. The balance of the increase of $19.0 million was in part the result of a full period of expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017 and in part due to an increase in expenses related to professional fees, rent expenses, information technology, and travel related to the growth of our existing partner firms and our acquisition of new partner firms.\nIntangible amortization increased $26.0 million, or 40.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily related to new partner firms which added amortization of $11.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 and a full period of amortization during the year ended December 31, 2018 for partner firms acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNon-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration decreased $15.7 million or 70.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018 the probability that certain contingent consideration payments\nwould be achieved decreased resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability.\nDepreciation and other amortization expense increased $1.7 million, or 25.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily related to a full period of depreciation and amortization for fixed assets acquired in 2017.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a gain on sale of investment of $5.5 million related to an investment in a financial service company previously carried at cost.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, a loss on extinguishment of borrowings of $21.1 million was recognized in connection with the Credit Facility.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense increased $11.0 million, or 729.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in income tax expense is primarily related to the fact that, in connection with the IPO and Reorganization Transactions, Focus Inc. became a holding company whose sole material asset is a membership interest in Focus LLC, and, as a result, Focus Inc. became subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes imposed on Focus Inc.'s allocable portion of taxable income from Focus LLC.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we met our cash and liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by our operations, proceeds from our IPO and borrowings under our Credit Facility. Over the next twelve months, and in the longer term, we expect that our cash and liquidity needs will continue to be met by cash generated by our ongoing operations as well as the Credit Facility, especially for acquisition activities. Our ongoing sources of cash will primarily consist of wealth management fees. We will primarily use cash flow from operations to pay compensation and related expenses, management fees, selling, general and administrative expenses, income taxes and debt service. For information the Credit Facility, please read \"Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Credit Facilities\".\nTax Receivable Agreements\nIn July 2018, in connection with the closing of the IPO, Focus Inc. entered into two Tax Receivable Agreements with the TRA holders. The agreements generally provide for the payment by Focus Inc. to each TRA holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax that Focus Inc. actually realizes (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances in periods after the IPO as a result of certain increases in tax basis and certain tax benefits attributable to imputed interest. Focus Inc. will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings.\nThe payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreements are Focus Inc.'s obligations and not obligations of Focus LLC, and we expect that such payments required to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreements will be substantial. Estimating the amount and timing of payments that may become due under the Tax Receivable Agreements is by its nature imprecise. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreements, cash savings in tax generally are calculated by comparing Focus Inc.'s actual tax liability (determined by using the actual applicable U.S. federal income tax rate and an assumed combined state and local income and franchise tax rate) to the amount Focus Inc. would have been required to pay had it not been able to utilize any of the tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreements. As of December 31, 2018, we expect that future payments to the TRA holders resulting\nfrom the IPO will be approximately $39.2 million, in aggregate. Future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements in respect of subsequent exchanges will be in addition to this amount.\nThe actual increases in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of any redemption of units, the price of our Class A common stock at the time of each redemption, the extent to which such redemptions are taxable transactions, the amount of Focus LLC's assets that consist of equity in entities taxed as corporations at the time of each redemption, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future, the U.S. federal income tax rates then applicable and the portion of the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements that constitute imputed interest or give rise to depreciable or amortizable tax basis.\nThe foregoing amount of expected future payments to TRA holders is merely an estimate and the actual payments could differ materially. It is possible that future transactions or events could increase or decrease the actual tax benefits realized and the corresponding payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements as compared to the foregoing estimates. Moreover, there may be a negative impact on our liquidity if, as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise, (i) the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements exceed the actual benefits realized in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreements and/or (ii) distributions to Focus Inc. by Focus LLC are not sufficient to permit Focus Inc. to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements after it has paid its taxes and other obligations.\nThe payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements will not be conditioned upon a TRA holder's having a continued ownership interest in either Focus Inc. or Focus LLC.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents information regarding our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2018 </th> <th> </th> <th>$ Change </th> <th> </th> <th>% Change </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>77,150 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>69,090 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(8,060 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (10.4 </td> <td>)% </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>69,090 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>105,919 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>36,829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(186,799 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(376,716 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(189,917 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>101.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(376,716 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(446,450 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(69,734 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>18.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110,864 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>342,403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>231,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>208.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>342,403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>322,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,916 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (5.8 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents-end of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>211.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>51,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18,242 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> (35.5 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities includes net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash expenses such as intangible amortization, depreciation and other amortization, amortization of debt financing costs, non-cash equity compensation expense, non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration, other non-cash items and changes in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Operating assets and liabilities include receivables from our clients, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, deferred revenues and other assets and liabilities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $8.1 million, or 10.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily the result of the net loss of $48.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $18.6 million, primarily offset by an increase in intangible\namortization of $13.4 million, non-cash equity compensation expense of $26.4 million and non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration of $23.4 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $36.8 million, or 53.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily related to a decrease in net loss of $7.3 million, and an increase in intangible amortization of $26.0 million, loss on extinguishment of borrowings of $10.9 million, other non-cash items of $10.6 million, and non-cash equity compensation expense of $9.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily offset by a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $14.0 million and non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration of $15.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $189.9 million, or 101.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions and contingent consideration of $194.5 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $69.7 million, or 18.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $47.3 million in cash paid for acquisitions and contingent consideration and an increase in investment and other of $23.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily associated with our $20.0 million minority equity interest in SmartAsset.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $231.5 million, or 208.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in net borrowings under the Credit Facility of $415.9 million and the Focus LLC convertible preferred unit issuance of $643.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 that did not occur during the year end December 31, 2016, offset by payments in connection with the Focus LLC unit redemption of $795.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. For more details regarding Focus LLC's convertible preferred unit issuance and unit redemption during the year ended December 31, 2017 please read the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $19.9 million, or 5.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings made under the Credit Facility of $701.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily offset by lower equity issuance proceeds net of equity redemptions of $656.2 million and an increase in debt financing costs of $28.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table describes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less than\n1 Year </th> <th> </th> <th>1 - 3 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>3 - 5 Years </th> <th> </th> <th>More than\n5 Years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility maturities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>838,985 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>8,030 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>16,060 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>56,060 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>758,835 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>238,438 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,869 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85,268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,256 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,649 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,045 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amounts due pursuant to tax receivable agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,606 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,300,977 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>92,885 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>165,198 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>184,152 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>858,742 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCredit Facilities\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had a credit facility of approximately $1,100.0 million consisting of term and revolving loans, inclusive of an accordion feature of $255.0 million (the \"Old Credit Facility\"). The Old Credit Facility had a June 2020 maturity date.\nIn July 2017, we entered into the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility initially consisted of a $795.0 million first lien term loan (the \"First Lien Term Loan\"), a $250.0 million First Lien Revolver, and a $207.0 million second lien term loan (the \"Second Lien Term Loan\"). In connection with the Credit Facility, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the Old Credit Facility with the proceeds from the Credit Facility and wrote off all deferred financing costs related to the Old Credit Facility resulting in a $8.1 million loss on extinguishment of borrowings.\nThe First Lien Term Loan has a maturity date of July 2024 and initially required quarterly installment repayments of approximately $2.0 million. The First Lien Term Loan was issued at a discount of 0.125% or $1.0 million that we are amortizing to interest expense over the term of the First Lien Term Loan. The First Lien Revolver initially had a maturity date of July 2022 and has no required quarterly installment repayments. Up to $30.0 million of the First Lien Revolver is available for the issuance of letters of credit, subject to certain limitations. The First Lien Term Loan (up to January 2018 as noted below) and First Lien Revolver bore interest (at our option) at: (i) LIBOR plus a margin of 3.25% with the First Lien Revolver having step downs to 3.00% and 2.75% based on achievement of a specified First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined below) or, (ii) the lender's Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Facility) plus a margin of 2.25% with the First Lien Revolver having step downs to 2.00% and 1.75% based on achievement of a specified First Lien Leverage Ratio. The Credit Facility also included an unused commitment fee of 0.50% of the outstanding commitments under the First Lien Revolver, with a stepdown to 0.375% based on achievement of a specified First Lien Leverage Ratio.\nIn January 2018, we amended our First Lien Term Loan to reduce our interest rate to LIBOR plus a margin of 2.75% or the lender's Base Rate plus a margin of 1.75%. As a result of the amendment, we recognized in January 2018 a loss on extinguishment of borrowings of $14.0 million, representing the write-off of $13.1 million and $0.9 million in deferred financing costs and unamortized discount related to the First Lien Term Loan.\nIn April 2018, we expanded our First Lien Term Loan by $200.0 million and incurred $1.3 million in debt financing costs. In addition, the quarterly installment repayments increased to $2.5 million beginning in June 2018.\nThe Second Lien Term Loan has a maturity date of July 2025 and bears interest (at our option) at: (i) LIBOR plus a margin of 7.50% or (ii) the lender's Base Rate plus a margin of 6.50%. The Second Lien Term Loan has no required installment repayments due prior to the maturity date. The Second Lien Term Loan was issued at a discount of 1.00% or $2.1 million that we are amortizing to interest expense over the term of the Second Lien Term Loan. The Second Lien Term Loan requires a prepayment penalty of 1.00% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Second Lien Term Loan if prepaid prior to July 2019.\nIn June 2018, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility that became effective upon closing of the IPO. The First Lien Term Loan was reduced to $803.0 million and was amended to reduce our interest rate to LIBOR plus a margin of 2.50% or the lender's Base Rate plus a margin of 1.50%, effective in July 2018 upon obtaining certain credit ratings. The First Lien Revolver was amended to increase our borrowing capacity to $650.0 million and extend the maturity date to 5 years from July 30, 2018. The First Lien Revolver was also amended such that it bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% with step downs to 1.75%, 1.50% and 1.25% or the lender's Base Rate plus a margin of 1.00% with step downs to 0.75%, 0.50% and 0.25%, based on achievement of a specified First Lien Leverage Ratio. The First Lien Revolver unused commitment fee is 0.50% with step downs to 0.375% and 0.25% based on achievement of a specified First Lien Leverage Ratio. The First Lien Term Loan also requires a prepayment penalty of 1% of the then outstanding principal amount of the First Lien Term Loan if repaid prior to January 2019. The Credit Facility was also amended to require quarterly First Lien Term Loan installment repayments of approximately $2.0 million and for us to maintain a First Lien Leverage Ratio of not more than 6.25:1.00, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.\nWe repaid the $207.0 million Second Lien Term Loan in July 2018. In connection with these amendments, we incurred debt financing costs of $5.0 million and recognized a loss of extinguishment of debt of $7.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOur obligations under the Credit Facility are collateralized by the majority of Focus LLC's assets. The Credit Facility contains various customary covenants, including, but not limited to: (i) incurring additional indebtedness or guarantees, (ii) creating liens or other encumbrances on property or granting negative pledges, (iii) entering into a merger or similar transaction, (iv) selling or transferring certain property and (v) declaring dividends or making other restricted payments.\nAt December 31, 2018, our First Lien Leverage Ratio was 3.33:1.00, which satisfied the maximum ratio of 6.25:1.00. First Lien Leverage Ratio means the ratio of amounts outstanding under the First Lien Term Loan and First Lien Revolver plus other outstanding debt obligations secured by a lien on our assets of (excluding letters of credit other than unpaid drawings thereunder) minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility). We are also subject to contingent principal payments based on excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Facility) commencing with and including the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 if our First Lien Leverage Ratio exceeds 3.75:1:00.\nAt December 31, 2018, outstanding stated value borrowings under the Credit Facility were $839.0 million. The weighted-average interest rate for borrowings was approximately 6% for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the First Lien Revolver available unused commitment line was $605.8 million. At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of $4.2 million bearing interest at an annual rate of approximately 1%.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our financial statements include the accounts of Focus Inc. and our subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Critical accounting policies are those that are the most important portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements, our most critical accounting policies are discussed below. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable and prudent. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWealth Management Fees\nWe, solely through our partner firms, recognize revenue when earned from wealth management fees, which are primarily comprised of fees earned from wealth management services, including investment advice, financial and tax planning, consulting, tax return preparation, family office services and other services. Client arrangements may contain a single or multiple performance obligations, each of which are separately identifiable and accounted for as the related services are provided and consumed over time. Fees are primarily based either on a contractual percentage of the client's assets, a flat fee, an hourly rate or a combination of such fees and are billed either in advance or arrears on a monthly, quarterly, or semiannual basis and such fees earned as the services are performed over time. Revenue for wealth management and operational support services provided to third-party wealth management firms is presented net since these services are performed in an agent capacity. Wealth management fees are recorded when: (i) an arrangement with a client has been identified; (ii) the performance obligations have been identified; (iii) the fee or other transaction price has been determined; (iv) the fee or other transaction price has been allocated to each performance obligation; and (v) we have satisfied the applicable performance obligation.\nOther\nOther revenue primarily includes recordkeeping and administration service fees, commissions and distribution fees and outsourced services. Client arrangements may contain a single or multiple performance obligations, each of which are separately identifiable and accounted for as the related services are provided and consumed over time. Recordkeeping and administration and outsourced services revenue, in accordance with the same five criteria above, are recognized over the period in which services are provided. Commissions and distribution fees are recognized when earned.\nDeferred Revenue\nFees collected in advance are deferred and recognized in revenue over the period earned with the unrecognized portion of fees collected in advance recorded as deferred revenue.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nBusiness acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805: Business Combinations. Business acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the purchase price consideration to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is recognized as the excess of the purchase price consideration over the fair value of net assets of the business acquired. All transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe have incorporated contingent consideration into the structure of our partner firm acquisitions. These arrangements may result in the payment of additional purchase price consideration to the sellers based on the growth of certain financial thresholds for periods following the closing of the respective acquisition. The additional purchase price consideration is payable in the form of cash and, in some cases, equity.\nFor business acquisitions, we recognize the fair value of estimated contingent consideration at the acquisition date as part of the consideration transferred in exchange for the acquired wealth management firm. The contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. Any changes in fair value are recognized each reporting period in non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe results of the acquired wealth management firms are included in our consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and is not amortized. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. We have no indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment as of October 1, or more frequently if events and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. A two-step impairment test is performed on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow approach. Under this approach, management uses certain assumptions including, but not limited to, a risk-adjusted rate that is estimated to be commensurate with the risk associated with the underlying cash flows, cash flow trends from prior periods, current-period cash flow, and management's expectation of future cash flows. Expectations of future cash flows are based on projections or forecasts derived from our understanding of the relevant business prospects, economic or market trends, and regulatory or legislative changes which may occur. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit in the first step, no further testing is performed. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit in the first step, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill to determine the extent of the impairment, if any.\nIn March 2018, we modified the manner in which we assess goodwill for impairment. We had determined for the purpose of our annual goodwill impairment test that our reporting units should be aggregated into one reporting unit. Our determination was based on; our reporting units having similar economic and business characteristics, and the services performed by the reporting units are wealth management related and that the reporting units are subject to a similar regulatory framework. We believe that the resulting change in accounting principle related to the reporting unit utilized in the annual goodwill impairment test did not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge. We determined that the change in accounting principle related to the reporting unit used in our annual impairment test is appropriate based on the nature of our business. The change would not have had an impact on the results of our impairment test for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIntangible assets and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired or that the estimated useful life should be changed prospectively. If impairment indicators are present, the recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the\ncarrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is determined using a discounted cash flow approach.\nIncome Taxes and Tax Receivable Agreements\nIn connection with the IPO and Reorganization Transactions, Focus Inc. became a holding company whose sole material asset is a membership interest in Focus LLC, and, as a result, Focus Inc. became subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on Focus Inc.'s allocable portion of taxable income from Focus LLC. Focus LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, Focus LLC is generally not and has not been subject to U.S. federal and certain state income taxes at the entity level, although it has been subject to the New York City Unincorporated Business Tax and certain of its subsidiaries have been subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local or foreign income taxes. Instead, for U.S. federal and certain state income tax purposes, the income, deductions, losses and credits of Focus LLC are passed through to its unitholders, which after the IPO includes Focus Inc. Focus LLC has historically made tax distribution payments in accordance with its Third Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, which was replaced by the Fourth Amended and Restated Focus LLC Agreement on July 30, 2018, and Focus Inc. intends to cause Focus LLC to continue to make tax distribution payments, to the extent of available cash, in accordance with the Fourth Amended and Restated Focus LLC Agreement. Focus Inc. files income tax returns with the U.S. federal government as well as various state and local jurisdictions.\nWe apply the asset and liability method for deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances, if any, are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nWe review and evaluate tax positions in our major tax jurisdictions and determine whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition. Based on this review, we have recorded no reserves for uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018.\nWe have entered into two Tax Receivable Agreements with the TRA holders. The agreements generally provide for the payment by us to each TRA holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax that we actually realize (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances in connection with the Reorganization Transactions and in periods after the IPO, as a result of certain increases in tax bases and certain tax benefits attributable to imputed interest. We will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings.\nAs a result of the Reorganization Transactions and the exchange of certain units of Focus LLC in connection with the IPO, Focus Inc. recorded a liability of approximately $39.2 million relating to its obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreements. The foregoing amount of expected future payments to TRA holders is merely an estimate and the actual payments could differ materially. It is possible that future transactions or events could increase or decrease the actual tax benefits realized and the corresponding payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements as compared to the foregoing estimates.\nConsolidation Considerations\nASC Topic 810, Consolidation, requires an entity to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (\"VIE\"). Under the standard, an enterprise has a controlling financial interest when it has (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that\ncould potentially be significant to the VIE. An enterprise that holds a controlling financial interest is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE.\nCertain of our subsidiaries have management agreements with the respective management company, which causes these operating subsidiaries to be VIEs. We have assessed whether or not we are the primary beneficiary for these operating subsidiaries and have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the results of these subsidiaries have been consolidated.\nCertain of our subsidiaries have variable interests in certain investment funds that are deemed voting interest entities. Due to substantive kick-out rights possessed by the limited partners of these funds, we do not consolidate the investment funds.\nFrom time to time, we enter into option agreements with wealth management firms (each, an \"Optionee\") and their owners. In exchange for payment of an option premium, the option agreement allows us, at our sole discretion, to acquire substantially all of the assets of the Optionee at a predetermined time and at a predetermined purchase price formula. If we choose to exercise our option, the acquisition and the corresponding management agreement would be executed in accordance with our typical acquisition structure. If we choose not to exercise the option, the option premium would be recorded as a loss on investment in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that the option expires. We have determined that the respective option agreements with the Optionees qualify the Optionees as VIEs. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the Optionees and do not consolidate the results of the Optionees.\nStock Based Compensation Costs\nCompensation cost for unit and stock based awards is measured based on the fair value of the unit and stock based awards determined by the Black-Scholes option pricing model or the Monte Carlo Simulation Model on the date that the unit-based awards are issued or modified, and is adjusted for the estimated number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. The compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of Effective Date.\" ASU No. 2015-14 defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year for public companies. ASU No. 2015-14 applies to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. ASU No. 2014-09 replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it became effective for us on January 1, 2018. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. Additionally, ASU No. 2014-09 requires enhanced disclosures, including revenue recognition policies to identify performance obligations to customers and significant judgements in measurement and recognition. We adopted ASU No. 2014-09 using the retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and no adjustments were required to prior periods because there were no changes to our recognition of revenues or presentation of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, \"Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\" The amendments in this update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU No. 2016-01 was effective for us beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842)\". ASU No. 2016-02 requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses in their income statements in a manner similar to current practice. ASU 2016-02 states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right of use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for us for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. We will adopt ASU No. 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective method and will not restate comparative periods. As permitted under the transition guidance, the assessment of whether contracts contain or are leases, classification of leases and remaining lease terms will be carried forward. Based on the portfolio of leases as of December 31, 2018, we estimate that approximately $146 million of lease assets and liabilities will be recognized on the balance sheet upon adoption, primarily related to operating leases for real estate. The actual impact may differ from this estimate. We do not expect a material impact to the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income/loss or consolidated statement of cash flows as a result of adoption of this new guidance.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" which amends ASC Topic 718, \"Stock Compensation.\" The objective of this amendment is part of the FASB's Simplification Initiative as it applies to several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-09 was effective for us on January 1, 2017. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.\" ASU No. 2016-15 made eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. We adopted ASU No. 2016-15 on January 1, 2017. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business,\" which amends the guidance of FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, \"Business Combinations,\" adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. ASU No. 2017-01 was effective for us prospectively on January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU No. 2017-01 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, \"Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\" which removes the second step of the goodwill impairment test that requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. ASU No. 2017-04 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and will be applied prospectively, early application is permitted. ASU No. 2017-04 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, \"Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.\" ASU No. 2017-09 provides guidance that clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require the application of modification accounting under ASC 718. ASU No. 2017-09 will allow for certain changes to be made to awards without accounting for them as modifications. We early adopted ASU No. 2017-09 during the year ended December 31, 2017. The adoption of ASU No. 2017-09 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, \"Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees by aligning it with the accounting for share-based payments to employees, with certain exceptions. ASU No. 2018-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year, with early adoption permitted after adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. The adoption of ASU No. 2018-07 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Intangible amortization increased $26.0 million, or 40.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily related to new partner firms which added amortization of $11.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 and a full period of amortization during the year ended December 31, 2018 for partner firms acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

In connection with the Credit Facility, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the Old Credit Facility with the proceeds from the Credit Facility and wrote off all deferred financing costs related to the Old Credit Facility resulting in a $8.1 million loss on extinguishment of borrowings.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $8.1 million, or 10.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

Those assets primarily consist of purchased fixed assets as well as fixed assets acquired through our acquisitions.\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2018 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>15,722 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(48,359 </td> <td>) </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>(41,087 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(88 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(222 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,266 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,448 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,501 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>9,450 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of debt financing costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,482 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,498 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intangible amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,942 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and other amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,370 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash equity compensation expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,468 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,143 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>22,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,638 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of investment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,509 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of borrowings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,071 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense (income), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,385 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>3,191 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,350 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Delayed offering cost expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other one-time transaction expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,590 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>103,038 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>145,226 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>203,402 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with \"Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data\" and the historical financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

ASU No. 2016-02 requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses in their income statements in a manner similar to current practice. ASU 2016-02 states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right of use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for us for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. We will adopt ASU No. 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective method and will not restate comparative periods. As permitted under the transition guidance, the assessment of whether contracts contain or are leases, classification of leases and remaining lease terms will be carried forward. Based on the portfolio of leases as of December 31, 2018, we estimate that approximately $146 million of lease assets and liabilities will be recognized on the balance sheet upon adoption, primarily related to operating leases for real estate. The actual impact may differ from this estimate. We do not expect a material impact to the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income/loss or consolidated statement of cash flows as a result of adoption of this new guidance.\nCompensation and Related Expenses\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

These new partner firms contributed approximately $102.5 million in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017.

By comparison, for the same periods our organic revenue growth was 5.2%, 13.4% and 13.0%, respectively. For additional information, please read \"-How We Evaluate our Business.\"\n(3)As of December 31, 2018, the estimated tax adjustments from intangible asset related income tax benefits from closed acquisitions based on a pro forma 27% tax rate for the next 12 months is approximately $25,171.\n(6)The issuance of Class A common stock that occurred upon closing of the IPO and the consummation of the Reorganization Transactions on July 30, 2018 is assumed to have occurred as of January 1, 2016 for comparative purposes.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.\" ASU No. 2016-15 made eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. We adopted ASU No. 2016-15 on January 1, 2017. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nAdjusted Net Income Per Share for the year ended December 31, 2018 is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the Adjusted Shares Outstanding. Adjusted Shares Outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes: (i) the weighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period, (ii) the weighted average incremental shares of Class A common stock related to stock options and unvested Class A common stock outstanding during the period, (iii) the weighted average number of Focus LLC common units outstanding during the period (assuming that 100% of such Focus LLC common units have been exchanged for Class A common stock) and (iv) the weighted average number of common unit equivalents of Focus LLC vested and unvested incentive units outstanding during the period based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on the last trading day of the period (assuming that 100% of such Focus LLC common units have been exchanged for Class A common stock).\nCompensation and related expenses include salaries, wages, related employee benefits and taxes for employees at our partner firms and employees at the Focus LLC company level. Compensation and related expenses also include non-cash compensation expense, associated with both Focus Inc.'s and Focus LLC's equity grants to employees and non-employees, including management company principals.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nfrom the IPO will be approximately $39.2 million, in aggregate. Future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements in respect of subsequent exchanges will be in addition to this amount.\nWe analyze our performance using Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share are non-GAAP measures. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss) excluding income tax expense (benefit), amortization of debt financing costs, intangible amortization and impairments, if any, non-cash equity compensation expense, non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration, gain on sale of investment, loss on extinguishment of borrowings, delayed offering cost expense, management contract buyout, if any, and other one-time transaction expenses. The calculation of Adjusted Net Income also includes adjustments to reflect (i) a pro forma 27% income tax rate assuming all earnings of Focus LLC were recognized by Focus Inc. and no earnings were attributable to non-controlling interests and (ii) tax adjustments from intangible asset related income tax benefits from acquisitions based on a pro forma 27% tax rate.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018:\nassociated Acquired Base Earnings of approximately $6.3 million. Each of these pending transactions is generally on terms and in a structure consistent with past transactions, and the closings are subject to customary closing conditions. Among other risks and uncertainties, there can be no guarantee that these acquisitions will be completed. For additional information regarding Acquired Base Earnings, please read \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Acquired Base Earnings.\"\nOur partnership is comprised of trusted professionals providing comprehensive wealth management services under a largely recurring, fee-based model, which differentiates our partner firms from the traditional brokerage platforms whose revenues are largely derived from commissions. We derive a substantial majority of our revenues from wealth management fees for investment advice, financial and tax planning, consulting, tax return preparation, family office services and other services. We also generate other revenues primarily from recordkeeping and administration service fees, commissions and distribution fees and outsourced services.\nNon-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration increased $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was the result of the increase in the probability that certain contingent consideration payments would be achieved, resulting in an increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n*Not meaningful\nContractual Obligations\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" which amends ASC Topic 718, \"Stock Compensation.\" The objective of this amendment is part of the FASB's Simplification Initiative as it applies to several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-09 was effective for us on January 1, 2017. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe review and evaluate tax positions in our major tax jurisdictions and determine whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition. Based on this review, we have recorded no reserves for uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, \"Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\" The amendments in this update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU No. 2016-01 was effective for us beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs a result of the Reorganization Transactions and the exchange of certain units of Focus LLC in connection with the IPO, Focus Inc. recorded a liability of approximately $39.2 million relating to its obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreements. The foregoing amount of expected future payments to TRA holders is merely an estimate and the actual payments could differ materially. It is possible that future transactions or events could increase or decrease the actual tax benefits realized and the corresponding payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements as compared to the foregoing estimates.\n\u2022 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share do not reflect all cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\nIn addition, we completed six, two and six acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, that did not meet the definition of a business under ASC Topic 805: Business Combinations. These acquisitions primarily related to the acquisition of customer lists.\nThe results of the acquired wealth management firms are included in our consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition.\nOverview\n\u2022 contingent consideration or earn outs can vary substantially from company to company and depending upon each company's growth metrics and accounting assumption methods; the non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration is not considered a key measure in comparing our operating performance; and\nWe, solely through our partner firms, recognize revenue when earned from wealth management fees, which are primarily comprised of fees earned from wealth management services, including investment advice, financial and tax planning, consulting, tax return preparation, family office services and other services. Client arrangements may contain a single or multiple performance obligations, each of which are separately identifiable and accounted for as the related services are provided and consumed over time. Fees are primarily based either on a contractual percentage of the client's assets, a flat fee, an hourly rate or a combination of such fees and are billed either in advance or arrears on a monthly, quarterly, or semiannual basis and such fees earned as the services are performed over time. Revenue for wealth management and operational support services provided to third-party wealth management firms is presented net since these services are performed in an agent capacity. Wealth management fees are recorded when: (i) an arrangement with a client has been identified; (ii) the performance obligations have been identified; (iii) the fee or other transaction price has been determined; (iv) the fee or other transaction price has been allocated to each performance obligation; and (v) we have satisfied the applicable performance obligation.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDepreciation and other amortization expense increased $1.7 million, or 25.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily related to a full period of depreciation and amortization for fixed assets acquired in 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities. The term Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss), operating income or any other performance or liquidity measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nInvesting Activities\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes our business acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\nCertain of our subsidiaries have management agreements with the respective management company, which causes these operating subsidiaries to be VIEs.

Management fees growth represents the period-over-period growth in GAAP management fees earned by management companies. While an expense, we believe that growth in management fees reflect the strength of the partnership.\nIn addition, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share can differ significantly from company to company depending on strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. We compensate for these limitations by relying also on the GAAP results and use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share as supplemental information.\n(1)Represents period-over-period growth in our GAAP revenue.\nRecent Developments\n\u2022 for planning purposes, including the preparation of budgets and forecasts;\nCash Flows\n(5)For additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share and Adjusted Shares Outstanding, including a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please read \"-Adjusted EBITDA\" and \"-Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share.\"\n\nThe foregoing amount of expected future payments to TRA holders is merely an estimate and the actual payments could differ materially. It is possible that future transactions or events could increase or decrease the actual tax benefits realized and the corresponding payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements as compared to the foregoing estimates. Moreover, there may be a negative impact on our liquidity if, as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise, (i) the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements exceed the actual benefits realized in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreements and/or (ii) distributions to Focus Inc. by Focus LLC are not sufficient to permit Focus Inc. to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements after it has paid its taxes and other obligations.\n(3)The terms of our management agreements entitle the management companies to management fees typically consisting of all EBPC in excess of Base Earnings up to Target Earnings, plus a\n\nWe have entered into two Tax Receivable Agreements with the TRA holders. The agreements generally provide for the payment by us to each TRA holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax that we actually realize (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances in connection with the Reorganization Transactions and in periods after the IPO, as a result of certain increases in tax bases and certain tax benefits attributable to imputed interest. We will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings.\nOther revenues increased $12.1 million, or 26.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is due primarily to $10.4 million from 2018 new partner firms principally related to outsourced services revenue.\nWe believe that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of, our reported GAAP results, provide additional useful information to investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations for various reasons, including the following:\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, our wealth management fees were impacted by the acquisitions of new partner firms and the growth of existing partner firms, which includes the acquisitions of wealth management practices and customer lists by our existing partner firms. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, we completed acquisitions of six, ten and eight partner firms, respectively. In 2016, the new partner firms were Douglas Lane & Associates, Kovitz Investment Group Partners, Waddell & Associates, Carnick & Kubik Group, GYL Financial Synergies and XML Financial Group. In 2017, the new partner firms were Crestwood Advisors, CFO4Life, One Charles Private Wealth, Bordeaux Wealth Advisors, Gelfand, Rennert & Feldman, Lake Street Advisors, Financial Professionals, SCS Financial Services, Brownlie & Braden and Eton Advisors. In 2018, the new partner firms were Cornerstone Wealth, Fortem Financial, Bartlett Wealth Management, Campbell Deegan Financial, Nigro Karlin Segal Feldstein & Bolno, Asset Advisors Investment Management, Edge Capital Group and Vista Wealth Management.\nRevenues\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had a credit facility of approximately $1,100.0 million consisting of term and revolving loans, inclusive of an accordion feature of $255.0 million (the \"Old Credit Facility\"). The Old Credit Facility had a June 2020 maturity date.\nAt December 31, 2018, our First Lien Leverage Ratio was 3.33:1.00, which satisfied the maximum ratio of 6.25:1.00. First Lien Leverage Ratio means the ratio of amounts outstanding under the First Lien Term Loan and First Lien Revolver plus other outstanding debt obligations secured by a lien on our assets of (excluding letters of credit other than unpaid drawings thereunder) minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility). We are also subject to contingent principal payments based on excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Facility) commencing with and including the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 if our First Lien Leverage Ratio exceeds 3.75:1:00.\nCompensation and related expenses increased $87.4 million, or 49.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase related to new partner firms was $40.2 million. The balance of the increase of $47.2 million was due to an increase in salaries and related expense, in part the result of a full year of expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016 and an increase of $26.4 million in non-cash equity compensation expense primarily related to the recognition of expense associated with the modification and vesting of certain Focus LLC common units and incentive units.\n\u2022 non-cash equity grants made to employees or non-employees at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time; stock-based compensation expense is not a key measure of our operating performance;\nOperating Expenses\n\u2022 amortization expenses can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon each company's financing and accounting methods, the fair value and average expected life of acquired intangible assets and the method by which assets were acquired; the amortization of intangible assets obtained in acquisitions are not considered a key measure in comparing our operating performance.\nAmortization of intangibles consists primarily of the amortization of intangibles we acquired through our various acquisitions of new partner firms and acquisitions by our partner firms.\nOperating Activities\nWe apply the asset and liability method for deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances, if any, are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nStock Based Compensation Costs\nManagement fees increased $69.1 million, or 42.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase related to the new partner firms was $26.0 million. Management fees are variable and a function of earnings during the period. The balance of the increase of $43.1 million was due to the increase in earnings during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, in part the result of a full period of earnings recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017 as well as new partner promotions.\nThe following discussion presents an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where possible and practical, have quantified the impact of such items.\nSources of Revenue\nWe repaid the $207.0 million Second Lien Term Loan in July 2018. In connection with these amendments, we incurred debt financing costs of $5.0 million and recognized a loss of extinguishment of debt of $7.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, a loss on extinguishment of borrowings of $8.1 million was recognized in connection with the Credit Facility.\nSince we began revenue-generating and acquisition activities in 2006, we have created a partnership of 60 partner firms, the substantial majority of which are RIAs registered with the SEC and built a business with revenues of $910.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, in excess of 95% of our revenues were fee-based and recurring in nature. We have established a national footprint across the United States and expanded our international footprint into the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $36.8 million, or 53.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily related to a decrease in net loss of $7.3 million, and an increase in intangible amortization of $26.0 million, loss on extinguishment of borrowings of $10.9 million, other non-cash items of $10.6 million, and non-cash equity compensation expense of $9.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily offset by a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $14.0 million and non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration of $15.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018:\nIn addition, Adjusted EBITDA can differ significantly from company to company depending on strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. We compensate for these limitations by relying also on the GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental information.\nFor business acquisitions, we recognize the fair value of estimated contingent consideration at the acquisition date as part of the consideration transferred in exchange for substantially all of the assets of the wealth management firm. The contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each\nOur obligations under the Credit Facility are collateralized by the majority of Focus LLC's assets. The Credit Facility contains various customary covenants, including, but not limited to: (i) incurring additional indebtedness or guarantees, (ii) creating liens or other encumbrances on property or granting negative pledges, (iii) entering into a merger or similar transaction, (iv) selling or transferring certain property and (v) declaring dividends or making other restricted payments.\nRevenues\ncould potentially be significant to the VIE. An enterprise that holds a controlling financial interest is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE.\nOperating Expenses\n(2)Organic revenue growth represents the period-over-period growth in revenue related to partner firms, including growth related to acquisitions of wealth management practices and customer relationships by our partner firms and partner firms that have merged, that for the entire periods presented, are included in our consolidated statements of operations for each of the entire periods presented. We believe these growth statistics are useful in that they present full-period revenue growth of partner firms on a \"same store\" basis exclusive of the effect of the partial results of partner firms that are acquired during the comparable periods.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $231.5 million, or 208.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in net borrowings under the Credit Facility of $415.9 million and the Focus LLC convertible preferred unit issuance of $643.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 that did not occur during the year end December 31, 2016, offset by payments in connection with the Focus LLC unit redemption of $795.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. For more details regarding Focus LLC's convertible preferred unit issuance and unit redemption during the year ended December 31, 2017 please read the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $69.7 million, or 18.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $47.3 million in cash paid for acquisitions and contingent consideration and an increase in investment and other of $23.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily associated with our $20.0 million minority equity interest in SmartAsset.\nwould be achieved decreased resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability.\nWe have incorporated contingent consideration into the structure of our partner firm acquisitions. These arrangements may result in the payment of additional purchase price consideration to the sellers based on the growth of certain financial thresholds for periods following the closing of the respective acquisition. The additional purchase price consideration is payable in the form of cash and, in some cases, equity.\nwealth management services and partner firm-level acquisitions and a full period of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIncome Taxes and Tax Receivable Agreements\n\nIn 2016, 2017 and 2018, our partner firms completed 12, 15 and 17 transactions, respectively, consisting of business acquisitions accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 805: Business Combinations and asset acquisitions.\nWe focus on several key financial metrics in evaluating the success of our business, the success of our partner firms and our resulting financial position and operating performance. Key metrics for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 include the following:\nCredit Facilities\nAdjusted Net Income Per Share for the periods prior to July 30, 2018 is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the Adjusted Shares Outstanding. Adjusted Shares Outstanding for the periods prior to July 30, 2018 was 71,843,916 and includes all vested and unvested shares of Class A common stock issued in connection with the IPO and Reorganization Transactions, assumes that all\nIntangible Amortization\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment as of October 1, or more frequently if events and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. A two-step impairment test is performed on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow approach. Under this approach, management uses certain assumptions including, but not limited to, a risk-adjusted rate that is estimated to be commensurate with the risk associated with the underlying cash flows, cash flow trends from prior periods, current-period cash flow, and management's expectation of future cash flows. Expectations of future cash flows are based on projections or forecasts derived from our understanding of the relevant business prospects, economic or market trends, and regulatory or legislative changes which may occur. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit in the first step, no further testing is performed. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit in the first step, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill to determine the extent of the impairment, if any.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of Effective Date.\" ASU No. 2015-14 defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year for public companies. ASU No. 2015-14 applies to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. ASU No. 2014-09 replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it became effective for us on January 1, 2018. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. Additionally, ASU No. 2014-09 requires enhanced disclosures, including revenue recognition policies to identify performance obligations to customers and significant judgements in measurement and recognition. We adopted ASU No. 2014-09 using the retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and no adjustments were required to prior periods because there were no changes to our recognition of revenues or presentation of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our financial statements include the accounts of Focus Inc. and our subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Critical accounting policies are those that are the most important portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements, our most critical accounting policies are discussed below. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable and prudent. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n(7)Represents the number of partner firms on the last day of the period presented. The number includes new partner firms acquired during the period reduced by any partner firms that merged with existing partner firms prior to the last day of the period.\n(9)Assumes that 100% of the vested and unvested Focus LLC incentive units were converted into Focus LLC common units based on the closing price of our Class A common stock at the end of the respective period and such Focus LLC common units were exchanged for Class A common stock. For the periods ending prior to July 30, 2018, the conversion to Focus LLC common units was based on the $33.00 IPO price.\nFrom January 1, 2019 to the date of this Annual Report, we completed 12 business acquisitions (accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805: Business Combinations) consisting of both new partner firms and acquisitions by our partner firms. The Acquired Base Earnings associated with the acquisition of the new partner firms during this period was approximately $11.9 million. Furthermore, we have signed definitive purchase agreements to acquire an additional two new partner firms with\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our acquisitions.\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) excluding interest income, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), amortization of debt financing costs, intangible amortization and impairments, if any, depreciation and other amortization, non-cash equity compensation expense, non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration, gain on sale of investment, loss on extinguishment of borrowings, other expense/income, net, delayed offering cost expense, other one-time transaction expenses, and management contract buyout, if any. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of, our reported GAAP results, provides additional useful information to investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations for various reasons, including the following:\nThe Second Lien Term Loan has a maturity date of July 2025 and bears interest (at our option) at: (i) LIBOR plus a margin of 7.50% or (ii) the lender's Base Rate plus a margin of 6.50%. The Second Lien Term Loan has no required installment repayments due prior to the maturity date. The Second Lien Term Loan was issued at a discount of 1.00% or $2.1 million that we are amortizing to interest expense over the term of the Second Lien Term Loan. The Second Lien Term Loan requires a prepayment penalty of 1.00% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Second Lien Term Loan if prepaid prior to July 2019.\nIncome tax expense increased $11.0 million, or 729.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in income tax expense is primarily related to the fact that, in connection with the IPO and Reorganization Transactions, Focus Inc. became a holding company whose sole material asset is a membership interest in Focus LLC, and, as a result, Focus Inc. became subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes imposed on Focus Inc.'s allocable portion of taxable income from Focus LLC.\nWe retain a cumulative preferred position in Base Earnings. To the extent earnings of an acquired business in any year are less than Base Earnings, in the following year we are entitled to receive Base Earnings together with the prior years' shortfall before any management fees are earned by the management company.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business,\" which amends the guidance of FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, \"Business Combinations,\" adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. ASU No. 2017-01 was effective for us prospectively on January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU No. 2017-01 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn July 2018, in connection with the closing of the IPO, Focus Inc. entered into two Tax Receivable Agreements with the TRA holders. The agreements generally provide for the payment by Focus Inc. to each TRA holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax that Focus Inc. actually realizes (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances in periods after the IPO as a result of certain increases in tax basis and certain tax benefits attributable to imputed interest. Focus Inc. will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings.\nDepreciation and Other Amortization\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $36.0 million, or 36.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase related to the new partner firms was $14.1 million. The balance of the increase of $21.9 million was in part the result of a full year of expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016 and in part due to an increase in expenses related to professional fees, travel, marketing and information technology expenses related to the growth of our existing partner firms and our acquisition of new partner firms, as well as the $9.8 million in delayed offering cost expense.\nOther\nWe expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of being a publicly traded company, including annual and quarterly report preparation, tax return preparation, independent auditor fees, investor relations activities, transfer agent fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and independent director compensation. We also expect our accounting, legal, tax and personnel-related expenses to increase as we supplement our compliance and governance functions, maintain and review internal controls over financial reporting and prepare and distribute periodic reports as required by the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nThe following table describes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nIntangible amortization increased $13.4 million, or 26.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. New partner firms added amortization of $13.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet cash provided by operating activities includes net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash expenses such as intangible amortization, depreciation and other amortization, amortization of debt financing costs, non-cash equity compensation expense, non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration, other non-cash items and changes in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Operating assets and liabilities include receivables from our clients, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, deferred revenues and other assets and liabilities.\n\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share\nNon-Cash Changes in Fair Value of Estimated Contingent Consideration\n\u2022 Other companies in the financial services industry may calculate Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nIncome Tax Expense\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\nOther revenue decreased $0.9 million, or 1.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily related to lower commissions and distribution fees.\nOther revenue primarily includes recordkeeping and administration service fees, commissions and distribution fees and outsourced services. Client arrangements may contain a single or multiple performance obligations, each of which are separately identifiable and accounted for as the related services are provided and consumed over time. Recordkeeping and administration and outsourced services revenue, in accordance with the same five criteria above, are recognized over the period in which services are provided. Commissions and distribution fees are recognized when earned.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe following table provides an illustrative example of our economics, including management fees earned by the management company, for periods of projected revenues, +10% growth in revenues and -10% growth in revenues. This example assumes (i) Target Earnings of $3.0 million; (ii) Base Earnings\nAdjusted EBITDA\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a gain on sale of investment of $5.5 million related to an investment in a financial service company previously carried at cost.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $19.9 million, or 5.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings made under the Credit Facility of $701.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily offset by lower equity issuance proceeds net of equity redemptions of $656.2 million and an increase in debt financing costs of $28.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNon-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration decreased $15.7 million or 70.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018 the probability that certain contingent consideration payments\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense on our debt or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments.\nWealth management fees increased $235.9 million, or 38.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. New partner firms added subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2017 that are included in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 include Cornerstone Wealth, Fortem Financial, Bartlett Wealth Management, Campbell Deegan Financial, Nigro Karlin Segal Feldstein & Bolno, Asset Advisors Investment Management, Edge Capital Group and Vista Wealth Management. These new partner firms contributed approximately $95.3 million in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. The balance of the increase of $140.6 million was due to the revenue growth at our existing partner firms associated with wealth management services and partner firm-level acquisitions and a full period of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nManagement fees increased $48.8 million, or 42.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase related to new partner firms was $19.3 million. Management fees are variable and a function of earnings during the period. The balance of the increase of $29.5 million was due to the increase in earnings during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, in part the result of a full year of earnings recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nPublic Company Expenses\nWe are a leading partnership of independent, fiduciary wealth management firms operating in the highly fragmented RIA industry, with a footprint of 60 partner firms primarily in the United States. We have achieved this market leadership by positioning ourselves as the partner of choice for many firms in an industry where a number of secular trends are driving RIA consolidation. Our partner firms primarily service ultra-high net worth and high net worth individuals and families by providing highly differentiated and comprehensive wealth management services. Our partner firms benefit from our intellectual and financial resources, operating in a scaled business model with aligned interests, while retaining their entrepreneurial culture and independence.\nIn March 2018, we modified the manner in which we assess goodwill for impairment. We had determined for the purpose of our annual goodwill impairment test that our reporting units should be aggregated into one reporting unit. Our determination was based on; our reporting units having similar economic and business characteristics, and the services performed by the reporting units are wealth management related and that the reporting units are subject to a similar regulatory framework. We believe that the resulting change in accounting principle related to the reporting unit utilized in the annual goodwill impairment test did not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge. We determined that the change in accounting principle related to the reporting unit used in our annual impairment test is appropriate based on the nature of our business. The change would not have had an impact on the results of our impairment test for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor business acquisitions, we recognize the fair value of estimated contingent consideration at the acquisition date as part of the consideration transferred in exchange for the acquired wealth management firm. The contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. Any changes in fair value are recognized each reporting period in non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of operations.\nreporting date until the contingency is resolved. Any changes in fair value are recognized each reporting period in non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration in our consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and is not amortized. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. We have no indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n\u2022 amortization expenses can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon each company's financing and accounting methods, the fair value and average expected life of acquired intangible assets and the method by which assets were acquired; the amortization of intangible assets obtained in acquisitions are not considered a key measure in comparing our operating performance.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, in excess of 95% of our revenues were fee-based and recurring in nature. Although the substantial majority of our revenues are fee-based and recurring, our revenues can fluctuate due to macroeconomic factors and the overall state of the financial markets, particularly in the United States. Our partner firms' wealth management fees are primarily based either on a contractual percentage of the client's assets, a flat fee, an hourly rate or a combination of such fees and are billed either in advance or arrears on a monthly, quarterly or semiannual basis. Because of the variety of billing practices across our partner firms, there is no direct correlation between short-term financial market movements and total revenues. Additionally, we estimate that approximately 23% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were not directly correlated to the financial markets. Longer term trends in the financial markets may favorably or unfavorably impact our total revenues, but not in a linear relationship. For example, during 2016, 2017 and 2018,\n\u2022 as a measure of operating performance;\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we met our cash and liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by our operations, proceeds from our IPO and borrowings under our Credit Facility. Over the next twelve months, and in the longer term, we expect that our cash and liquidity needs will continue to be met by cash generated by our ongoing operations as well as the Credit Facility, especially for acquisition activities. Our ongoing sources of cash will primarily consist of wealth management fees. We will primarily use cash flow from operations to pay compensation and related expenses, management fees, selling, general and administrative expenses, income taxes and debt service. For information the Credit Facility, please read \"Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Credit Facilities\".\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, \"Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.\" ASU No. 2017-09 provides guidance that clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require the application of modification accounting under ASC 718. ASU No. 2017-09 will allow for certain changes to be made to awards without accounting for them as modifications. We early adopted ASU No. 2017-09 during the year ended December 31, 2017. The adoption of ASU No. 2017-09 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table presents information regarding our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n(1)In 2018, primarily relates to one-time expenses related to (a) Q4 2018 Loring Ward severance cash compensation of $507, which was recorded in compensation and related expenses, and Q3 2018 IPO and Reorganization Transaction cash compensation expenses of $5,926, which were recorded in compensation and related expenses, (b) transaction expenses of $1,762, which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, associated with the acquisition of Loring Ward, of which $1,114 were incurred in Q4 2018 and $648 were incurred in Q3 2018 and (c) Q4 2018 other expenses, net of $2,373, which were recorded in other (expense) income-net, primarily related to the loss on sale of a tax customer list and related receivables. In 2017, relates to one-time transaction expenses, which were recorded in other (expense) income-net, related to insurance fees associated with the investment by our private equity investors.\nCertain of our subsidiaries have variable interests in certain investment funds that are deemed voting interest entities. Due to substantive kick-out rights possessed by the limited partners of these funds, we do not consolidate the investment funds.\nAt December 31, 2018, outstanding stated value borrowings under the Credit Facility were $839.0 million. The weighted-average interest rate for borrowings was approximately 6% for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the First Lien Revolver available unused commitment line was $605.8 million. At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of $4.2 million bearing interest at an annual rate of approximately 1%.\nWhile we have to date, with limited exceptions, acquired substantially all of the assets of a target firm, following our acquisition of a new partner firm, the partner firm continues to be primarily managed by its principals through their 100% ownership of a new management company formed by them concurrently with the acquisition. Our operating subsidiary, the management company and the principals enter into a management agreement that provides for the payment of ongoing management fees to the management company. The terms of the management agreements are generally six years subject to automatic renewals for consecutive one-year terms, unless earlier terminated by either the management company or us in certain limited situations. Under the management agreement, the management company is entitled to management fees typically consisting of all EBPC in excess of Base Earnings up to Target Earnings, plus a percentage of EBPC in excess of Target Earnings.\nIncome Tax Expense\nDepreciation and other amortization expense increased $1.0 million, or 17.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due primarily to acquisitions and capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAs a flow-through entity, Focus LLC is generally not and has not been subject to U.S. federal and certain state income taxes at the entity level, although it has been subject to the New York City Unincorporated Business Tax. Instead, for U.S. federal and certain state income tax purposes, taxable income was and is passed through to its unitholders, which, after the IPO on July 30, 2018, now includes Focus Inc. Focus Inc. is subject to U.S. federal and certain state income taxes applicable to corporations. Accordingly, our effective tax rate, and the absolute dollar amount of our tax expense, has increased as a result of the IPO.\nAs a result of our economic arrangements with the various management company entities, 100% of management fees are variable expenses.\nSources of Liquidity\ncarrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is determined using a discounted cash flow approach.\n\u2022 as a consideration in determining compensation for certain employees.\n*Not meaningful\n(2)For periods ended prior to the closing of the IPO and the consummation of the Reorganization Transactions on July 30, 2018, certain tax related adjustments are being made for comparative purposes only.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $189.9 million, or 101.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions and contingent consideration of $194.5 million.\nWe have typically incorporated into our acquisition structure contingent consideration paid to the sellers upon the satisfaction of specified financial thresholds, and the purchase price for a typical acquisition is comprised of a base purchase price and the right to receive such contingent consideration in the form of earn out payments. The contingent consideration is paid upon the satisfaction of specified growth thresholds typically over a six-year period. This arrangement may result in the payment of additional purchase price consideration to the sellers for periods following the closing of an acquisition. The growth thresholds are typically tied to CAGR of the partner firm's earnings. Earn out payments are typically payable in cash and, in some cases, equity.\n\u2022 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and\n(5)Represents our GAAP weighted average Class A common stock outstanding-basic.\nIn June 2018, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility that became effective upon closing of the IPO. The First Lien Term Loan was reduced to $803.0 million and was amended to reduce our interest rate to LIBOR plus a margin of 2.50% or the lender's Base Rate plus a margin of 1.50%, effective in July 2018 upon obtaining certain credit ratings. The First Lien Revolver was amended to increase our borrowing capacity to $650.0 million and extend the maturity date to 5 years from July 30, 2018. The First Lien Revolver was also amended such that it bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% with step downs to 1.75%, 1.50% and 1.25% or the lender's Base Rate plus a margin of 1.00% with step downs to 0.75%, 0.50% and 0.25%, based on achievement of a specified First Lien Leverage Ratio. The First Lien Revolver unused commitment fee is 0.50% with step downs to 0.375% and 0.25% based on achievement of a specified First Lien Leverage Ratio. The First Lien Term Loan also requires a prepayment penalty of 1% of the then outstanding principal amount of the First Lien Term Loan if repaid prior to January 2019. The Credit Facility was also amended to require quarterly First Lien Term Loan installment repayments of approximately $2.0 million and for us to maintain a First Lien Leverage Ratio of not more than 6.25:1.00, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.\nThe purchase price is comprised of a base purchase price and a right to receive contingent consideration in the form of earn out payments. The base purchase price typically consists of an upfront cash payment and may include equity. The contingent consideration generally consists of earn outs over a six year period following the closing, with payment upon the satisfaction of specified growth thresholds. The growth thresholds are typically tied to the CAGR of the partner firm's earnings. The contingent consideration is typically payable in cash and, in some cases, equity.\nIntangible assets and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired or that the estimated useful life should be changed prospectively. If impairment indicators are present, the recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the\nOur operating expenses consist of compensation and related expenses, management fees, selling, general and administrative expenses, intangible amortization, non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration and depreciation and other amortization expense.\nASC Topic 810, Consolidation, requires an entity to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (\"VIE\"). Under the standard, an enterprise has a controlling financial interest when it has (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that\nTax Treatment\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, a loss on extinguishment of borrowings of $21.1 million was recognized in connection with the Credit Facility.\nacquired of 60% of Target Earnings or $1.8 million; and (iii) a percentage of earnings in excess of Target Earnings retained by the management company of 40%.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nBusiness Acquisitions\nThe following discussion presents an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where possible and practical, have quantified the impact of such items.\n\u2022 to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; and\n\u2022 contingent consideration or earn outs can vary substantially from company to company and depending upon each company's growth metrics and accounting assumption methods; the non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration is not considered a key measure in comparing our operating performance; and\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $35.7 million, or 26.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase related to new partner firms was $16.7 million. The balance of the increase of $19.0 million was in part the result of a full period of expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017 and in part due to an increase in expenses related to professional fees, rent expenses, information technology, and travel related to the growth of our existing partner firms and our acquisition of new partner firms.\n\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA:\n(7)The incremental shares for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to stock options and unvested Class A common stock as calculated using the treasury stock method were not included in the calculation of weighted average shares of Class A common stock-diluted as the result would have been anti-dilutive.\nIncome tax expense decreased $2.5 million, or 253.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in income tax expense is primarily related to the remeasurement of certain of our deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2017, based on the reduction in the tax rate at which they are expected to reverse. Such remeasurement resulted in an income tax benefit of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nHow We Evaluate Our Business\n\nOur partner firms provide comprehensive wealth management services under a largely recurring, fee-based model. We, solely through our partner firms, derive a substantial majority of our revenue from wealth management fees, which are comprised of fees earned from wealth management services, including investment advice, financial and tax planning, consulting, tax return preparation, family office services and other services. Fees are primarily based either on a contractual percentage of the client's assets, a flat fee, an hourly rate or a combination of such fees and are billed either in advance or arrears on a monthly, quarterly or semiannual basis. In certain cases, such wealth management fees may be subject to minimum fee levels depending on the services performed. We also generate other revenues, which primarily include recordkeeping and administration service fees, commissions and distribution fees and outsourced services. The following table summarizes our sources of revenue:\nTax Receivable Agreements\n(4)Organic management fees growth represents the period-over-period growth in management fees earned by management companies related to partner firms, including growth related to acquisitions of wealth management practices and customer relationships by our partner firms and partner firms that have merged, that for the entire periods presented, are included in our consolidated statements of operations for each of the entire periods presented. We believe that these growth statistics are useful in that they present full-period growth of management fees on a \"same store\" basis exclusive of the effect of the partial period results of partner firms that are acquired during the comparable periods.\nThe payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreements are Focus Inc.'s obligations and not obligations of Focus LLC, and we expect that such payments required to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreements will be substantial. Estimating the amount and timing of payments that may become due under the Tax Receivable Agreements is by its nature imprecise. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreements, cash savings in tax generally are calculated by comparing Focus Inc.'s actual tax liability (determined by using the actual applicable U.S. federal income tax rate and an assumed combined state and local income and franchise tax rate) to the amount Focus Inc. would have been required to pay had it not been able to utilize any of the tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreements. As of December 31, 2018, we expect that future payments to the TRA holders resulting\n(6)The terms of our management agreements entitle the management companies to management fees typically consisting of all future EBPC of the acquired wealth management firm in excess of Base Earnings up to Target Earnings, plus a percentage of any EBPC in excess of Target Earnings. Acquired Base Earnings is equal to our retained cumulative preferred position in Base Earnings. We are entitled to receive these earnings notwithstanding any earnings that we are entitled to receive in excess of Target Earnings. Base Earnings may change in future periods for various business or contractual matters. For example, from time to time when a partner firm consummates an acquisition, the management agreement among the partner firm, the management company and the principals is amended to adjust Base Earnings and Target Earnings to reflect the projected post-acquisition earnings of the partner firm.\nvested non-compensatory stock options and unvested compensatory stock options outstanding at the closing of the IPO have been exercised (assuming vesting of unvested compensatory stock options and a then-current value of the Class A common stock equal to the $33.00 IPO price) and assumes that 100% of the Focus LLC common units and vested and unvested incentive units outstanding at the closing of the IPO have been exchanged for Class A common stock (assuming vesting of the unvested incentive units and a then-current value of the Focus LLC common units equal to the $33.00 IPO price).\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, \"Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\" which removes the second step of the goodwill impairment test that requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. ASU No. 2017-04 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and will be applied prospectively, early application is permitted. ASU No. 2017-04 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, \"Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees by aligning it with the accounting for share-based payments to employees, with certain exceptions. ASU No. 2018-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year, with early adoption permitted after adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. The adoption of ASU No. 2018-07 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe completed 12, 23 and 19 business acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, consisting of both new partner firms and acquisitions by our partner firms. Such business acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805: Business Combinations.\nItem 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBusiness acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805: Business Combinations. Business acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the purchase price consideration to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is recognized as the excess of the purchase price consideration over the fair value of net assets of the business acquired. All transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\nIn connection with the IPO and Reorganization Transactions, Focus Inc. became a holding company whose sole material asset is a membership interest in Focus LLC, and, as a result, Focus Inc. became subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on Focus Inc.'s allocable portion of taxable income from Focus LLC. Focus LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, Focus LLC is generally not and has not been subject to U.S. federal and certain state income taxes at the entity level, although it has been subject to the New York City Unincorporated Business Tax and certain of its subsidiaries have been subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local or foreign income taxes. Instead, for U.S. federal and certain state income tax purposes, the income, deductions, losses and credits of Focus LLC are passed through to its unitholders, which after the IPO includes Focus Inc. Focus LLC has historically made tax distribution payments in accordance with its Third Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, which was replaced by the Fourth Amended and Restated Focus LLC Agreement on July 30, 2018, and Focus Inc. intends to cause Focus LLC to continue to make tax distribution payments, to the extent of available cash, in accordance with the Fourth Amended and Restated Focus LLC Agreement. Focus Inc. files income tax returns with the U.S. federal government as well as various state and local jurisdictions.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn January 2018, we amended our First Lien Term Loan to reduce our interest rate to LIBOR plus a margin of 2.75% or the lender's Base Rate plus a margin of 1.75%. As a result of the amendment, we recognized in January 2018 a loss on extinguishment of borrowings of $14.0 million, representing the write-off of $13.1 million and $0.9 million in deferred financing costs and unamortized discount related to the First Lien Term Loan.\nFactors Affecting Comparability\nOur future results of operations may not be comparable to our historical results of operations, principally for the following reasons:\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share do not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities. The terms Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share are not defined under GAAP, and Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share are not a measure of net income (loss), operating income or any other performance or liquidity measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nCompensation cost for unit and stock based awards is measured based on the fair value of the unit and stock based awards determined by the Black-Scholes option pricing model or the Monte Carlo Simulation Model on the date that the unit-based awards are issued or modified, and is adjusted for the estimated number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. The compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\namortization of $13.4 million, non-cash equity compensation expense of $26.4 million and non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration of $23.4 million.\nFrom time to time, we enter into option agreements with wealth management firms (each, an \"Optionee\") and their owners. In exchange for payment of an option premium, the option agreement allows us, at our sole discretion, to acquire substantially all of the assets of the Optionee at a predetermined time and at a predetermined purchase price formula. If we choose to exercise our option, the acquisition and the corresponding management agreement would be executed in accordance with our typical acquisition structure. If we choose not to exercise the option, the option premium would be recorded as a loss on investment in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that the option expires. We have determined that the respective option agreements with the Optionees qualify the Optionees as VIEs. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the Optionees and do not consolidate the results of the Optionees.\nDeferred Revenue\n(4)For periods ended prior to the closing of the IPO and the consummation of the Reorganization Transactions on July 30, 2018, the Adjusted Shares Outstanding are deemed to be outstanding for comparative purposes only.\n\u2022 non-cash equity grants made to employees or non-employees at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time; stock-based compensation expense is not a key measure of our operating performance;\nThe actual increases in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of any redemption of units, the price of our Class A common stock at the time of each redemption, the extent to which such redemptions are taxable transactions, the amount of Focus LLC's assets that consist of equity in entities taxed as corporations at the time of each redemption, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future, the U.S. federal income tax rates then applicable and the portion of the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements that constitute imputed interest or give rise to depreciable or amortizable tax basis.\nThe First Lien Term Loan has a maturity date of July 2024 and initially required quarterly installment repayments of approximately $2.0 million. The First Lien Term Loan was issued at a discount of 0.125% or $1.0 million that we are amortizing to interest expense over the term of the First Lien Term Loan. The First Lien Revolver initially had a maturity date of July 2022 and has no required quarterly installment repayments. Up to $30.0 million of the First Lien Revolver is available for the issuance of letters of credit, subject to certain limitations. The First Lien Term Loan (up to January 2018 as noted below) and First Lien Revolver bore interest (at our option) at: (i) LIBOR plus a margin of 3.25% with the First Lien Revolver having step downs to 3.00% and 2.75% based on achievement of a specified First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined below) or, (ii) the lender's Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Facility) plus a margin of 2.25% with the First Lien Revolver having step downs to 2.00% and 1.75% based on achievement of a specified First Lien Leverage Ratio. The Credit Facility also included an unused commitment fee of 0.50% of the outstanding commitments under the First Lien Revolver, with a stepdown to 0.375% based on achievement of a specified First Lien Leverage Ratio.\nWealth Management Fees", "item_7_text": "Intangible amortization increased $26.0 million, or 40.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily related to new partner firms which added amortization of $11.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 and a full period of amortization during the year ended December 31, 2018 for partner firms acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements will not be conditioned upon a TRA holder's having a continued ownership interest in either Focus Inc. or Focus LLC.\n(8)Assumes that 100% of the Focus LLC common units were exchanged for Class A common stock.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include rent, insurance premiums, professional fees, travel and entertainment and other costs.\nCompensation and related expenses increased $92.5 million, or 34.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase related to new partner firms was $35.7 million. The balance of the increase of $56.8 million was due to an increase of $47.2 million in salaries and related expense, in part the result of a full period of expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017 and an increase of $9.6 million in non-cash compensation expense primarily related to the recognition of expenses associated with the modification and vesting of certain Focus LLC common units and incentive units.\nResults of Operations\nFinancing Activities\nIn July 2017, we entered into the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility initially consisted of a $795.0 million first lien term loan (the \"First Lien Term Loan\"), a $250.0 million First Lien Revolver, and a $207.0 million second lien term loan (the \"Second Lien Term Loan\"). In connection with the Credit Facility, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the Old Credit Facility with the proceeds from the Credit Facility and wrote off all deferred financing costs related to the Old Credit Facility resulting in a $8.1 million loss on extinguishment of borrowings.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $8.1 million, or 10.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily the result of the net loss of $48.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $18.6 million, primarily offset by an increase in intangible\nDepreciation and other amortization expense primarily represents the benefits we received from using long-lived assets such as computers and equipment, leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures. Those assets primarily consist of purchased fixed assets as well as fixed assets acquired through our acquisitions.\nYou should read this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with \"Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data\" and the historical financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The information in this section contains forward-looking statements. Please read \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" Our actual results may differ significantly from the results suggested by these forward-looking statements and from our historical results. Some factors that may cause our results to differ are described in \"Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\" The historical financial data discussed below reflects the historical results of operations and financial position of Focus Inc., including consolidation of its investment in Focus LLC, since July 30, 2018. Prior to July 30, 2018, the closing date of the IPO, the historical financial data discussed below represents the historical results of operations and financial position of Focus LLC.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842)\". ASU No. 2016-02 requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses in their income statements in a manner similar to current practice. ASU 2016-02 states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right of use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for us for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. We will adopt ASU No. 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective method and will not restate comparative periods. As permitted under the transition guidance, the assessment of whether contracts contain or are leases, classification of leases and remaining lease terms will be carried forward. Based on the portfolio of leases as of December 31, 2018, we estimate that approximately $146 million of lease assets and liabilities will be recognized on the balance sheet upon adoption, primarily related to operating leases for real estate. The actual impact may differ from this estimate. We do not expect a material impact to the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income/loss or consolidated statement of cash flows as a result of adoption of this new guidance.\nCompensation and Related Expenses\nFees collected in advance are deferred and recognized in revenue over the period earned with the unrecognized portion of fees collected in advance recorded as deferred revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nIn April 2018, we expanded our First Lien Term Loan by $200.0 million and incurred $1.3 million in debt financing costs. In addition, the quarterly installment repayments increased to $2.5 million beginning in June 2018.\nSubstantially all of our acquisitions have been paid for with a combination of cash flow from operations, proceeds from the IPO, proceeds from borrowings under the Credit Facility and equity, valued at the then-fair market value.\nManagement Fees\nWealth management fees increased $178.3 million, or 40.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. New partner firms added during the year ended December 31, 2017 were Crestwood Advisors, CFO4Life, One Charles Private Wealth, Bordeaux Wealth Advisors, Gelfand Rennert & Feldman, Lake Street Advisors, Financial Professionals, SCS Financial Services, Brownlie & Braden and Eton Advisors. These new partner firms contributed approximately $102.5 million in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017. The balance of the increase of $75.8 million was due to the revenue growth at our existing partner firms associated with\n\u2022 to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business;\nConsolidation Considerations\nthe Standard & Poor's 500 Index had a total return of 12.0%, 21.8% and (4.4)%, respectively, and the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index had a total return for the same periods of 2.6%, 3.5% and 0.0%, respectively. By comparison, for the same periods our organic revenue growth was 5.2%, 13.4% and 13.0%, respectively. For additional information, please read \"-How We Evaluate our Business.\"\n(3)As of December 31, 2018, the estimated tax adjustments from intangible asset related income tax benefits from closed acquisitions based on a pro forma 27% tax rate for the next 12 months is approximately $25,171.\n(6)The issuance of Class A common stock that occurred upon closing of the IPO and the consummation of the Reorganization Transactions on July 30, 2018 is assumed to have occurred as of January 1, 2016 for comparative purposes.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.\" ASU No. 2016-15 made eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. We adopted ASU No. 2016-15 on January 1, 2017. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nAdjusted Net Income Per Share for the year ended December 31, 2018 is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the Adjusted Shares Outstanding. Adjusted Shares Outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes: (i) the weighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period, (ii) the weighted average incremental shares of Class A common stock related to stock options and unvested Class A common stock outstanding during the period, (iii) the weighted average number of Focus LLC common units outstanding during the period (assuming that 100% of such Focus LLC common units have been exchanged for Class A common stock) and (iv) the weighted average number of common unit equivalents of Focus LLC vested and unvested incentive units outstanding during the period based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on the last trading day of the period (assuming that 100% of such Focus LLC common units have been exchanged for Class A common stock).\nCompensation and related expenses include salaries, wages, related employee benefits and taxes for employees at our partner firms and employees at the Focus LLC company level. Compensation and related expenses also include non-cash compensation expense, associated with both Focus Inc.'s and Focus LLC's equity grants to employees and non-employees, including management company principals.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nfrom the IPO will be approximately $39.2 million, in aggregate. Future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements in respect of subsequent exchanges will be in addition to this amount.\nWe analyze our performance using Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share are non-GAAP measures. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss) excluding income tax expense (benefit), amortization of debt financing costs, intangible amortization and impairments, if any, non-cash equity compensation expense, non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration, gain on sale of investment, loss on extinguishment of borrowings, delayed offering cost expense, management contract buyout, if any, and other one-time transaction expenses. The calculation of Adjusted Net Income also includes adjustments to reflect (i) a pro forma 27% income tax rate assuming all earnings of Focus LLC were recognized by Focus Inc. and no earnings were attributable to non-controlling interests and (ii) tax adjustments from intangible asset related income tax benefits from acquisitions based on a pro forma 27% tax rate.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018:\nassociated Acquired Base Earnings of approximately $6.3 million. Each of these pending transactions is generally on terms and in a structure consistent with past transactions, and the closings are subject to customary closing conditions. Among other risks and uncertainties, there can be no guarantee that these acquisitions will be completed. For additional information regarding Acquired Base Earnings, please read \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Acquired Base Earnings.\"\nOur partnership is comprised of trusted professionals providing comprehensive wealth management services under a largely recurring, fee-based model, which differentiates our partner firms from the traditional brokerage platforms whose revenues are largely derived from commissions. We derive a substantial majority of our revenues from wealth management fees for investment advice, financial and tax planning, consulting, tax return preparation, family office services and other services. We also generate other revenues primarily from recordkeeping and administration service fees, commissions and distribution fees and outsourced services.\nNon-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration increased $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was the result of the increase in the probability that certain contingent consideration payments would be achieved, resulting in an increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n*Not meaningful\nContractual Obligations\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" which amends ASC Topic 718, \"Stock Compensation.\" The objective of this amendment is part of the FASB's Simplification Initiative as it applies to several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-09 was effective for us on January 1, 2017. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe review and evaluate tax positions in our major tax jurisdictions and determine whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition. Based on this review, we have recorded no reserves for uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, \"Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\" The amendments in this update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU No. 2016-01 was effective for us beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs a result of the Reorganization Transactions and the exchange of certain units of Focus LLC in connection with the IPO, Focus Inc. recorded a liability of approximately $39.2 million relating to its obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreements. The foregoing amount of expected future payments to TRA holders is merely an estimate and the actual payments could differ materially. It is possible that future transactions or events could increase or decrease the actual tax benefits realized and the corresponding payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements as compared to the foregoing estimates.\n\u2022 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share do not reflect all cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\nIn addition, we completed six, two and six acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, that did not meet the definition of a business under ASC Topic 805: Business Combinations. These acquisitions primarily related to the acquisition of customer lists.\nThe results of the acquired wealth management firms are included in our consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition.\nOverview\n\u2022 contingent consideration or earn outs can vary substantially from company to company and depending upon each company's growth metrics and accounting assumption methods; the non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration is not considered a key measure in comparing our operating performance; and\nWe, solely through our partner firms, recognize revenue when earned from wealth management fees, which are primarily comprised of fees earned from wealth management services, including investment advice, financial and tax planning, consulting, tax return preparation, family office services and other services. Client arrangements may contain a single or multiple performance obligations, each of which are separately identifiable and accounted for as the related services are provided and consumed over time. Fees are primarily based either on a contractual percentage of the client's assets, a flat fee, an hourly rate or a combination of such fees and are billed either in advance or arrears on a monthly, quarterly, or semiannual basis and such fees earned as the services are performed over time. Revenue for wealth management and operational support services provided to third-party wealth management firms is presented net since these services are performed in an agent capacity. Wealth management fees are recorded when: (i) an arrangement with a client has been identified; (ii) the performance obligations have been identified; (iii) the fee or other transaction price has been determined; (iv) the fee or other transaction price has been allocated to each performance obligation; and (v) we have satisfied the applicable performance obligation.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDepreciation and other amortization expense increased $1.7 million, or 25.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily related to a full period of depreciation and amortization for fixed assets acquired in 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities. The term Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss), operating income or any other performance or liquidity measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nInvesting Activities\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes our business acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\nCertain of our subsidiaries have management agreements with the respective management company, which causes these operating subsidiaries to be VIEs. We have assessed whether or not we are the primary beneficiary for these operating subsidiaries and have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the results of these subsidiaries have been consolidated.\npercentage of any EBPC in excess of Target Earnings. Management fees growth represents the period-over-period growth in GAAP management fees earned by management companies. While an expense, we believe that growth in management fees reflect the strength of the partnership.\nIn addition, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share can differ significantly from company to company depending on strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. We compensate for these limitations by relying also on the GAAP results and use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share as supplemental information.\n(1)Represents period-over-period growth in our GAAP revenue.\nRecent Developments\n\u2022 for planning purposes, including the preparation of budgets and forecasts;\nCash Flows\n(5)For additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share and Adjusted Shares Outstanding, including a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please read \"-Adjusted EBITDA\" and \"-Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share.\"\n\nThe foregoing amount of expected future payments to TRA holders is merely an estimate and the actual payments could differ materially. It is possible that future transactions or events could increase or decrease the actual tax benefits realized and the corresponding payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements as compared to the foregoing estimates. Moreover, there may be a negative impact on our liquidity if, as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise, (i) the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements exceed the actual benefits realized in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreements and/or (ii) distributions to Focus Inc. by Focus LLC are not sufficient to permit Focus Inc. to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements after it has paid its taxes and other obligations.\n(3)The terms of our management agreements entitle the management companies to management fees typically consisting of all EBPC in excess of Base Earnings up to Target Earnings, plus a\n\nWe have entered into two Tax Receivable Agreements with the TRA holders. The agreements generally provide for the payment by us to each TRA holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax that we actually realize (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances in connection with the Reorganization Transactions and in periods after the IPO, as a result of certain increases in tax bases and certain tax benefits attributable to imputed interest. We will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings.\nOther revenues increased $12.1 million, or 26.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is due primarily to $10.4 million from 2018 new partner firms principally related to outsourced services revenue.\nWe believe that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of, our reported GAAP results, provide additional useful information to investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations for various reasons, including the following:\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, our wealth management fees were impacted by the acquisitions of new partner firms and the growth of existing partner firms, which includes the acquisitions of wealth management practices and customer lists by our existing partner firms. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, we completed acquisitions of six, ten and eight partner firms, respectively. In 2016, the new partner firms were Douglas Lane & Associates, Kovitz Investment Group Partners, Waddell & Associates, Carnick & Kubik Group, GYL Financial Synergies and XML Financial Group. In 2017, the new partner firms were Crestwood Advisors, CFO4Life, One Charles Private Wealth, Bordeaux Wealth Advisors, Gelfand, Rennert & Feldman, Lake Street Advisors, Financial Professionals, SCS Financial Services, Brownlie & Braden and Eton Advisors. In 2018, the new partner firms were Cornerstone Wealth, Fortem Financial, Bartlett Wealth Management, Campbell Deegan Financial, Nigro Karlin Segal Feldstein & Bolno, Asset Advisors Investment Management, Edge Capital Group and Vista Wealth Management.\nRevenues\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had a credit facility of approximately $1,100.0 million consisting of term and revolving loans, inclusive of an accordion feature of $255.0 million (the \"Old Credit Facility\"). The Old Credit Facility had a June 2020 maturity date.\nAt December 31, 2018, our First Lien Leverage Ratio was 3.33:1.00, which satisfied the maximum ratio of 6.25:1.00. First Lien Leverage Ratio means the ratio of amounts outstanding under the First Lien Term Loan and First Lien Revolver plus other outstanding debt obligations secured by a lien on our assets of (excluding letters of credit other than unpaid drawings thereunder) minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility). We are also subject to contingent principal payments based on excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Facility) commencing with and including the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 if our First Lien Leverage Ratio exceeds 3.75:1:00.\nCompensation and related expenses increased $87.4 million, or 49.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase related to new partner firms was $40.2 million. The balance of the increase of $47.2 million was due to an increase in salaries and related expense, in part the result of a full year of expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016 and an increase of $26.4 million in non-cash equity compensation expense primarily related to the recognition of expense associated with the modification and vesting of certain Focus LLC common units and incentive units.\n\u2022 non-cash equity grants made to employees or non-employees at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time; stock-based compensation expense is not a key measure of our operating performance;\nOperating Expenses\n\u2022 amortization expenses can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon each company's financing and accounting methods, the fair value and average expected life of acquired intangible assets and the method by which assets were acquired; the amortization of intangible assets obtained in acquisitions are not considered a key measure in comparing our operating performance.\nAmortization of intangibles consists primarily of the amortization of intangibles we acquired through our various acquisitions of new partner firms and acquisitions by our partner firms.\nOperating Activities\nWe apply the asset and liability method for deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances, if any, are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nStock Based Compensation Costs\nManagement fees increased $69.1 million, or 42.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase related to the new partner firms was $26.0 million. Management fees are variable and a function of earnings during the period. The balance of the increase of $43.1 million was due to the increase in earnings during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, in part the result of a full period of earnings recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017 as well as new partner promotions.\nThe following discussion presents an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where possible and practical, have quantified the impact of such items.\nSources of Revenue\nWe repaid the $207.0 million Second Lien Term Loan in July 2018. In connection with these amendments, we incurred debt financing costs of $5.0 million and recognized a loss of extinguishment of debt of $7.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, a loss on extinguishment of borrowings of $8.1 million was recognized in connection with the Credit Facility.\nSince we began revenue-generating and acquisition activities in 2006, we have created a partnership of 60 partner firms, the substantial majority of which are RIAs registered with the SEC and built a business with revenues of $910.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, in excess of 95% of our revenues were fee-based and recurring in nature. We have established a national footprint across the United States and expanded our international footprint into the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $36.8 million, or 53.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily related to a decrease in net loss of $7.3 million, and an increase in intangible amortization of $26.0 million, loss on extinguishment of borrowings of $10.9 million, other non-cash items of $10.6 million, and non-cash equity compensation expense of $9.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily offset by a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $14.0 million and non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration of $15.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018:\nIn addition, Adjusted EBITDA can differ significantly from company to company depending on strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. We compensate for these limitations by relying also on the GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental information.\nFor business acquisitions, we recognize the fair value of estimated contingent consideration at the acquisition date as part of the consideration transferred in exchange for substantially all of the assets of the wealth management firm. The contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each\nOur obligations under the Credit Facility are collateralized by the majority of Focus LLC's assets. The Credit Facility contains various customary covenants, including, but not limited to: (i) incurring additional indebtedness or guarantees, (ii) creating liens or other encumbrances on property or granting negative pledges, (iii) entering into a merger or similar transaction, (iv) selling or transferring certain property and (v) declaring dividends or making other restricted payments.\nRevenues\ncould potentially be significant to the VIE. An enterprise that holds a controlling financial interest is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE.\nOperating Expenses\n(2)Organic revenue growth represents the period-over-period growth in revenue related to partner firms, including growth related to acquisitions of wealth management practices and customer relationships by our partner firms and partner firms that have merged, that for the entire periods presented, are included in our consolidated statements of operations for each of the entire periods presented. We believe these growth statistics are useful in that they present full-period revenue growth of partner firms on a \"same store\" basis exclusive of the effect of the partial results of partner firms that are acquired during the comparable periods.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $231.5 million, or 208.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in net borrowings under the Credit Facility of $415.9 million and the Focus LLC convertible preferred unit issuance of $643.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 that did not occur during the year end December 31, 2016, offset by payments in connection with the Focus LLC unit redemption of $795.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. For more details regarding Focus LLC's convertible preferred unit issuance and unit redemption during the year ended December 31, 2017 please read the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $69.7 million, or 18.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $47.3 million in cash paid for acquisitions and contingent consideration and an increase in investment and other of $23.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily associated with our $20.0 million minority equity interest in SmartAsset.\nwould be achieved decreased resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability.\nWe have incorporated contingent consideration into the structure of our partner firm acquisitions. These arrangements may result in the payment of additional purchase price consideration to the sellers based on the growth of certain financial thresholds for periods following the closing of the respective acquisition. The additional purchase price consideration is payable in the form of cash and, in some cases, equity.\nwealth management services and partner firm-level acquisitions and a full period of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIncome Taxes and Tax Receivable Agreements\n\nIn 2016, 2017 and 2018, our partner firms completed 12, 15 and 17 transactions, respectively, consisting of business acquisitions accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 805: Business Combinations and asset acquisitions.\nWe focus on several key financial metrics in evaluating the success of our business, the success of our partner firms and our resulting financial position and operating performance. Key metrics for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 include the following:\nCredit Facilities\nAdjusted Net Income Per Share for the periods prior to July 30, 2018 is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the Adjusted Shares Outstanding. Adjusted Shares Outstanding for the periods prior to July 30, 2018 was 71,843,916 and includes all vested and unvested shares of Class A common stock issued in connection with the IPO and Reorganization Transactions, assumes that all\nIntangible Amortization\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment as of October 1, or more frequently if events and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. A two-step impairment test is performed on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow approach. Under this approach, management uses certain assumptions including, but not limited to, a risk-adjusted rate that is estimated to be commensurate with the risk associated with the underlying cash flows, cash flow trends from prior periods, current-period cash flow, and management's expectation of future cash flows. Expectations of future cash flows are based on projections or forecasts derived from our understanding of the relevant business prospects, economic or market trends, and regulatory or legislative changes which may occur. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit in the first step, no further testing is performed. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit in the first step, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill to determine the extent of the impairment, if any.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\" which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of Effective Date.\" ASU No. 2015-14 defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year for public companies. ASU No. 2015-14 applies to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. ASU No. 2014-09 replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it became effective for us on January 1, 2018. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. Additionally, ASU No. 2014-09 requires enhanced disclosures, including revenue recognition policies to identify performance obligations to customers and significant judgements in measurement and recognition. We adopted ASU No. 2014-09 using the retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and no adjustments were required to prior periods because there were no changes to our recognition of revenues or presentation of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our financial statements include the accounts of Focus Inc. and our subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Critical accounting policies are those that are the most important portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements, our most critical accounting policies are discussed below. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable and prudent. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n(7)Represents the number of partner firms on the last day of the period presented. The number includes new partner firms acquired during the period reduced by any partner firms that merged with existing partner firms prior to the last day of the period.\n(9)Assumes that 100% of the vested and unvested Focus LLC incentive units were converted into Focus LLC common units based on the closing price of our Class A common stock at the end of the respective period and such Focus LLC common units were exchanged for Class A common stock. For the periods ending prior to July 30, 2018, the conversion to Focus LLC common units was based on the $33.00 IPO price.\nFrom January 1, 2019 to the date of this Annual Report, we completed 12 business acquisitions (accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805: Business Combinations) consisting of both new partner firms and acquisitions by our partner firms. The Acquired Base Earnings associated with the acquisition of the new partner firms during this period was approximately $11.9 million. Furthermore, we have signed definitive purchase agreements to acquire an additional two new partner firms with\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our acquisitions.\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) excluding interest income, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), amortization of debt financing costs, intangible amortization and impairments, if any, depreciation and other amortization, non-cash equity compensation expense, non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration, gain on sale of investment, loss on extinguishment of borrowings, other expense/income, net, delayed offering cost expense, other one-time transaction expenses, and management contract buyout, if any. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of, our reported GAAP results, provides additional useful information to investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations for various reasons, including the following:\nThe Second Lien Term Loan has a maturity date of July 2025 and bears interest (at our option) at: (i) LIBOR plus a margin of 7.50% or (ii) the lender's Base Rate plus a margin of 6.50%. The Second Lien Term Loan has no required installment repayments due prior to the maturity date. The Second Lien Term Loan was issued at a discount of 1.00% or $2.1 million that we are amortizing to interest expense over the term of the Second Lien Term Loan. The Second Lien Term Loan requires a prepayment penalty of 1.00% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Second Lien Term Loan if prepaid prior to July 2019.\nIncome tax expense increased $11.0 million, or 729.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in income tax expense is primarily related to the fact that, in connection with the IPO and Reorganization Transactions, Focus Inc. became a holding company whose sole material asset is a membership interest in Focus LLC, and, as a result, Focus Inc. became subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes imposed on Focus Inc.'s allocable portion of taxable income from Focus LLC.\nWe retain a cumulative preferred position in Base Earnings. To the extent earnings of an acquired business in any year are less than Base Earnings, in the following year we are entitled to receive Base Earnings together with the prior years' shortfall before any management fees are earned by the management company.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business,\" which amends the guidance of FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, \"Business Combinations,\" adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. ASU No. 2017-01 was effective for us prospectively on January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU No. 2017-01 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn July 2018, in connection with the closing of the IPO, Focus Inc. entered into two Tax Receivable Agreements with the TRA holders. The agreements generally provide for the payment by Focus Inc. to each TRA holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax that Focus Inc. actually realizes (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances in periods after the IPO as a result of certain increases in tax basis and certain tax benefits attributable to imputed interest. Focus Inc. will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings.\nDepreciation and Other Amortization\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $36.0 million, or 36.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase related to the new partner firms was $14.1 million. The balance of the increase of $21.9 million was in part the result of a full year of expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016 and in part due to an increase in expenses related to professional fees, travel, marketing and information technology expenses related to the growth of our existing partner firms and our acquisition of new partner firms, as well as the $9.8 million in delayed offering cost expense.\nOther\nWe expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of being a publicly traded company, including annual and quarterly report preparation, tax return preparation, independent auditor fees, investor relations activities, transfer agent fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and independent director compensation. We also expect our accounting, legal, tax and personnel-related expenses to increase as we supplement our compliance and governance functions, maintain and review internal controls over financial reporting and prepare and distribute periodic reports as required by the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nThe following table describes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nIntangible amortization increased $13.4 million, or 26.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. New partner firms added amortization of $13.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet cash provided by operating activities includes net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash expenses such as intangible amortization, depreciation and other amortization, amortization of debt financing costs, non-cash equity compensation expense, non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration, other non-cash items and changes in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Operating assets and liabilities include receivables from our clients, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, deferred revenues and other assets and liabilities.\n\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share\nNon-Cash Changes in Fair Value of Estimated Contingent Consideration\n\u2022 Other companies in the financial services industry may calculate Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nIncome Tax Expense\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\nOther revenue decreased $0.9 million, or 1.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily related to lower commissions and distribution fees.\nOther revenue primarily includes recordkeeping and administration service fees, commissions and distribution fees and outsourced services. Client arrangements may contain a single or multiple performance obligations, each of which are separately identifiable and accounted for as the related services are provided and consumed over time. Recordkeeping and administration and outsourced services revenue, in accordance with the same five criteria above, are recognized over the period in which services are provided. Commissions and distribution fees are recognized when earned.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe following table provides an illustrative example of our economics, including management fees earned by the management company, for periods of projected revenues, +10% growth in revenues and -10% growth in revenues. This example assumes (i) Target Earnings of $3.0 million; (ii) Base Earnings\nAdjusted EBITDA\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a gain on sale of investment of $5.5 million related to an investment in a financial service company previously carried at cost.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $19.9 million, or 5.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings made under the Credit Facility of $701.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily offset by lower equity issuance proceeds net of equity redemptions of $656.2 million and an increase in debt financing costs of $28.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNon-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration decreased $15.7 million or 70.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018 the probability that certain contingent consideration payments\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense on our debt or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments.\nWealth management fees increased $235.9 million, or 38.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. New partner firms added subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2017 that are included in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 include Cornerstone Wealth, Fortem Financial, Bartlett Wealth Management, Campbell Deegan Financial, Nigro Karlin Segal Feldstein & Bolno, Asset Advisors Investment Management, Edge Capital Group and Vista Wealth Management. These new partner firms contributed approximately $95.3 million in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. The balance of the increase of $140.6 million was due to the revenue growth at our existing partner firms associated with wealth management services and partner firm-level acquisitions and a full period of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nManagement fees increased $48.8 million, or 42.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase related to new partner firms was $19.3 million. Management fees are variable and a function of earnings during the period. The balance of the increase of $29.5 million was due to the increase in earnings during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, in part the result of a full year of earnings recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nPublic Company Expenses\nWe are a leading partnership of independent, fiduciary wealth management firms operating in the highly fragmented RIA industry, with a footprint of 60 partner firms primarily in the United States. We have achieved this market leadership by positioning ourselves as the partner of choice for many firms in an industry where a number of secular trends are driving RIA consolidation. Our partner firms primarily service ultra-high net worth and high net worth individuals and families by providing highly differentiated and comprehensive wealth management services. Our partner firms benefit from our intellectual and financial resources, operating in a scaled business model with aligned interests, while retaining their entrepreneurial culture and independence.\nIn March 2018, we modified the manner in which we assess goodwill for impairment. We had determined for the purpose of our annual goodwill impairment test that our reporting units should be aggregated into one reporting unit. Our determination was based on; our reporting units having similar economic and business characteristics, and the services performed by the reporting units are wealth management related and that the reporting units are subject to a similar regulatory framework. We believe that the resulting change in accounting principle related to the reporting unit utilized in the annual goodwill impairment test did not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge. We determined that the change in accounting principle related to the reporting unit used in our annual impairment test is appropriate based on the nature of our business. The change would not have had an impact on the results of our impairment test for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor business acquisitions, we recognize the fair value of estimated contingent consideration at the acquisition date as part of the consideration transferred in exchange for the acquired wealth management firm. The contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. Any changes in fair value are recognized each reporting period in non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of operations.\nreporting date until the contingency is resolved. Any changes in fair value are recognized each reporting period in non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration in our consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and is not amortized. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. We have no indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n\u2022 amortization expenses can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon each company's financing and accounting methods, the fair value and average expected life of acquired intangible assets and the method by which assets were acquired; the amortization of intangible assets obtained in acquisitions are not considered a key measure in comparing our operating performance.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, in excess of 95% of our revenues were fee-based and recurring in nature. Although the substantial majority of our revenues are fee-based and recurring, our revenues can fluctuate due to macroeconomic factors and the overall state of the financial markets, particularly in the United States. Our partner firms' wealth management fees are primarily based either on a contractual percentage of the client's assets, a flat fee, an hourly rate or a combination of such fees and are billed either in advance or arrears on a monthly, quarterly or semiannual basis. Because of the variety of billing practices across our partner firms, there is no direct correlation between short-term financial market movements and total revenues. Additionally, we estimate that approximately 23% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were not directly correlated to the financial markets. Longer term trends in the financial markets may favorably or unfavorably impact our total revenues, but not in a linear relationship. For example, during 2016, 2017 and 2018,\n\u2022 as a measure of operating performance;\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we met our cash and liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by our operations, proceeds from our IPO and borrowings under our Credit Facility. Over the next twelve months, and in the longer term, we expect that our cash and liquidity needs will continue to be met by cash generated by our ongoing operations as well as the Credit Facility, especially for acquisition activities. Our ongoing sources of cash will primarily consist of wealth management fees. We will primarily use cash flow from operations to pay compensation and related expenses, management fees, selling, general and administrative expenses, income taxes and debt service. For information the Credit Facility, please read \"Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Credit Facilities\".\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, \"Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.\" ASU No. 2017-09 provides guidance that clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require the application of modification accounting under ASC 718. ASU No. 2017-09 will allow for certain changes to be made to awards without accounting for them as modifications. We early adopted ASU No. 2017-09 during the year ended December 31, 2017. The adoption of ASU No. 2017-09 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table presents information regarding our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n(1)In 2018, primarily relates to one-time expenses related to (a) Q4 2018 Loring Ward severance cash compensation of $507, which was recorded in compensation and related expenses, and Q3 2018 IPO and Reorganization Transaction cash compensation expenses of $5,926, which were recorded in compensation and related expenses, (b) transaction expenses of $1,762, which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, associated with the acquisition of Loring Ward, of which $1,114 were incurred in Q4 2018 and $648 were incurred in Q3 2018 and (c) Q4 2018 other expenses, net of $2,373, which were recorded in other (expense) income-net, primarily related to the loss on sale of a tax customer list and related receivables. In 2017, relates to one-time transaction expenses, which were recorded in other (expense) income-net, related to insurance fees associated with the investment by our private equity investors.\nCertain of our subsidiaries have variable interests in certain investment funds that are deemed voting interest entities. Due to substantive kick-out rights possessed by the limited partners of these funds, we do not consolidate the investment funds.\nAt December 31, 2018, outstanding stated value borrowings under the Credit Facility were $839.0 million. The weighted-average interest rate for borrowings was approximately 6% for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the First Lien Revolver available unused commitment line was $605.8 million. At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of $4.2 million bearing interest at an annual rate of approximately 1%.\nWhile we have to date, with limited exceptions, acquired substantially all of the assets of a target firm, following our acquisition of a new partner firm, the partner firm continues to be primarily managed by its principals through their 100% ownership of a new management company formed by them concurrently with the acquisition. Our operating subsidiary, the management company and the principals enter into a management agreement that provides for the payment of ongoing management fees to the management company. The terms of the management agreements are generally six years subject to automatic renewals for consecutive one-year terms, unless earlier terminated by either the management company or us in certain limited situations. Under the management agreement, the management company is entitled to management fees typically consisting of all EBPC in excess of Base Earnings up to Target Earnings, plus a percentage of EBPC in excess of Target Earnings.\nIncome Tax Expense\nDepreciation and other amortization expense increased $1.0 million, or 17.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due primarily to acquisitions and capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAs a flow-through entity, Focus LLC is generally not and has not been subject to U.S. federal and certain state income taxes at the entity level, although it has been subject to the New York City Unincorporated Business Tax. Instead, for U.S. federal and certain state income tax purposes, taxable income was and is passed through to its unitholders, which, after the IPO on July 30, 2018, now includes Focus Inc. Focus Inc. is subject to U.S. federal and certain state income taxes applicable to corporations. Accordingly, our effective tax rate, and the absolute dollar amount of our tax expense, has increased as a result of the IPO.\nAs a result of our economic arrangements with the various management company entities, 100% of management fees are variable expenses.\nSources of Liquidity\ncarrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is determined using a discounted cash flow approach.\n\u2022 as a consideration in determining compensation for certain employees.\n*Not meaningful\n(2)For periods ended prior to the closing of the IPO and the consummation of the Reorganization Transactions on July 30, 2018, certain tax related adjustments are being made for comparative purposes only.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $189.9 million, or 101.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions and contingent consideration of $194.5 million.\nWe have typically incorporated into our acquisition structure contingent consideration paid to the sellers upon the satisfaction of specified financial thresholds, and the purchase price for a typical acquisition is comprised of a base purchase price and the right to receive such contingent consideration in the form of earn out payments. The contingent consideration is paid upon the satisfaction of specified growth thresholds typically over a six-year period. This arrangement may result in the payment of additional purchase price consideration to the sellers for periods following the closing of an acquisition. The growth thresholds are typically tied to CAGR of the partner firm's earnings. Earn out payments are typically payable in cash and, in some cases, equity.\n\u2022 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and\n(5)Represents our GAAP weighted average Class A common stock outstanding-basic.\nIn June 2018, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility that became effective upon closing of the IPO. The First Lien Term Loan was reduced to $803.0 million and was amended to reduce our interest rate to LIBOR plus a margin of 2.50% or the lender's Base Rate plus a margin of 1.50%, effective in July 2018 upon obtaining certain credit ratings. The First Lien Revolver was amended to increase our borrowing capacity to $650.0 million and extend the maturity date to 5 years from July 30, 2018. The First Lien Revolver was also amended such that it bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00% with step downs to 1.75%, 1.50% and 1.25% or the lender's Base Rate plus a margin of 1.00% with step downs to 0.75%, 0.50% and 0.25%, based on achievement of a specified First Lien Leverage Ratio. The First Lien Revolver unused commitment fee is 0.50% with step downs to 0.375% and 0.25% based on achievement of a specified First Lien Leverage Ratio. The First Lien Term Loan also requires a prepayment penalty of 1% of the then outstanding principal amount of the First Lien Term Loan if repaid prior to January 2019. The Credit Facility was also amended to require quarterly First Lien Term Loan installment repayments of approximately $2.0 million and for us to maintain a First Lien Leverage Ratio of not more than 6.25:1.00, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.\nThe purchase price is comprised of a base purchase price and a right to receive contingent consideration in the form of earn out payments. The base purchase price typically consists of an upfront cash payment and may include equity. The contingent consideration generally consists of earn outs over a six year period following the closing, with payment upon the satisfaction of specified growth thresholds. The growth thresholds are typically tied to the CAGR of the partner firm's earnings. The contingent consideration is typically payable in cash and, in some cases, equity.\nIntangible assets and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired or that the estimated useful life should be changed prospectively. If impairment indicators are present, the recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the\nOur operating expenses consist of compensation and related expenses, management fees, selling, general and administrative expenses, intangible amortization, non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration and depreciation and other amortization expense.\nASC Topic 810, Consolidation, requires an entity to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (\"VIE\"). Under the standard, an enterprise has a controlling financial interest when it has (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that\nTax Treatment\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, a loss on extinguishment of borrowings of $21.1 million was recognized in connection with the Credit Facility.\nacquired of 60% of Target Earnings or $1.8 million; and (iii) a percentage of earnings in excess of Target Earnings retained by the management company of 40%.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nBusiness Acquisitions\nThe following discussion presents an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where possible and practical, have quantified the impact of such items.\n\u2022 to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; and\n\u2022 contingent consideration or earn outs can vary substantially from company to company and depending upon each company's growth metrics and accounting assumption methods; the non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration is not considered a key measure in comparing our operating performance; and\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $35.7 million, or 26.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase related to new partner firms was $16.7 million. The balance of the increase of $19.0 million was in part the result of a full period of expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 for partner firms that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017 and in part due to an increase in expenses related to professional fees, rent expenses, information technology, and travel related to the growth of our existing partner firms and our acquisition of new partner firms.\n\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA:\n(7)The incremental shares for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to stock options and unvested Class A common stock as calculated using the treasury stock method were not included in the calculation of weighted average shares of Class A common stock-diluted as the result would have been anti-dilutive.\nIncome tax expense decreased $2.5 million, or 253.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in income tax expense is primarily related to the remeasurement of certain of our deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2017, based on the reduction in the tax rate at which they are expected to reverse. Such remeasurement resulted in an income tax benefit of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nHow We Evaluate Our Business\n\nOur partner firms provide comprehensive wealth management services under a largely recurring, fee-based model. We, solely through our partner firms, derive a substantial majority of our revenue from wealth management fees, which are comprised of fees earned from wealth management services, including investment advice, financial and tax planning, consulting, tax return preparation, family office services and other services. Fees are primarily based either on a contractual percentage of the client's assets, a flat fee, an hourly rate or a combination of such fees and are billed either in advance or arrears on a monthly, quarterly or semiannual basis. In certain cases, such wealth management fees may be subject to minimum fee levels depending on the services performed. We also generate other revenues, which primarily include recordkeeping and administration service fees, commissions and distribution fees and outsourced services. The following table summarizes our sources of revenue:\nTax Receivable Agreements\n(4)Organic management fees growth represents the period-over-period growth in management fees earned by management companies related to partner firms, including growth related to acquisitions of wealth management practices and customer relationships by our partner firms and partner firms that have merged, that for the entire periods presented, are included in our consolidated statements of operations for each of the entire periods presented. We believe that these growth statistics are useful in that they present full-period growth of management fees on a \"same store\" basis exclusive of the effect of the partial period results of partner firms that are acquired during the comparable periods.\nThe payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreements are Focus Inc.'s obligations and not obligations of Focus LLC, and we expect that such payments required to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreements will be substantial. Estimating the amount and timing of payments that may become due under the Tax Receivable Agreements is by its nature imprecise. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreements, cash savings in tax generally are calculated by comparing Focus Inc.'s actual tax liability (determined by using the actual applicable U.S. federal income tax rate and an assumed combined state and local income and franchise tax rate) to the amount Focus Inc. would have been required to pay had it not been able to utilize any of the tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreements. As of December 31, 2018, we expect that future payments to the TRA holders resulting\n(6)The terms of our management agreements entitle the management companies to management fees typically consisting of all future EBPC of the acquired wealth management firm in excess of Base Earnings up to Target Earnings, plus a percentage of any EBPC in excess of Target Earnings. Acquired Base Earnings is equal to our retained cumulative preferred position in Base Earnings. We are entitled to receive these earnings notwithstanding any earnings that we are entitled to receive in excess of Target Earnings. Base Earnings may change in future periods for various business or contractual matters. For example, from time to time when a partner firm consummates an acquisition, the management agreement among the partner firm, the management company and the principals is amended to adjust Base Earnings and Target Earnings to reflect the projected post-acquisition earnings of the partner firm.\nvested non-compensatory stock options and unvested compensatory stock options outstanding at the closing of the IPO have been exercised (assuming vesting of unvested compensatory stock options and a then-current value of the Class A common stock equal to the $33.00 IPO price) and assumes that 100% of the Focus LLC common units and vested and unvested incentive units outstanding at the closing of the IPO have been exchanged for Class A common stock (assuming vesting of the unvested incentive units and a then-current value of the Focus LLC common units equal to the $33.00 IPO price).\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, \"Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\" which removes the second step of the goodwill impairment test that requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. ASU No. 2017-04 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and will be applied prospectively, early application is permitted. ASU No. 2017-04 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, \"Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\" which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees by aligning it with the accounting for share-based payments to employees, with certain exceptions. ASU No. 2018-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year, with early adoption permitted after adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. The adoption of ASU No. 2018-07 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe completed 12, 23 and 19 business acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, consisting of both new partner firms and acquisitions by our partner firms. Such business acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805: Business Combinations.\nItem 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBusiness acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805: Business Combinations. Business acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the purchase price consideration to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is recognized as the excess of the purchase price consideration over the fair value of net assets of the business acquired. All transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\nIn connection with the IPO and Reorganization Transactions, Focus Inc. became a holding company whose sole material asset is a membership interest in Focus LLC, and, as a result, Focus Inc. became subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on Focus Inc.'s allocable portion of taxable income from Focus LLC. Focus LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, Focus LLC is generally not and has not been subject to U.S. federal and certain state income taxes at the entity level, although it has been subject to the New York City Unincorporated Business Tax and certain of its subsidiaries have been subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local or foreign income taxes. Instead, for U.S. federal and certain state income tax purposes, the income, deductions, losses and credits of Focus LLC are passed through to its unitholders, which after the IPO includes Focus Inc. Focus LLC has historically made tax distribution payments in accordance with its Third Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, which was replaced by the Fourth Amended and Restated Focus LLC Agreement on July 30, 2018, and Focus Inc. intends to cause Focus LLC to continue to make tax distribution payments, to the extent of available cash, in accordance with the Fourth Amended and Restated Focus LLC Agreement. Focus Inc. files income tax returns with the U.S. federal government as well as various state and local jurisdictions.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn January 2018, we amended our First Lien Term Loan to reduce our interest rate to LIBOR plus a margin of 2.75% or the lender's Base Rate plus a margin of 1.75%. As a result of the amendment, we recognized in January 2018 a loss on extinguishment of borrowings of $14.0 million, representing the write-off of $13.1 million and $0.9 million in deferred financing costs and unamortized discount related to the First Lien Term Loan.\nFactors Affecting Comparability\nOur future results of operations may not be comparable to our historical results of operations, principally for the following reasons:\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share do not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities. The terms Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share are not defined under GAAP, and Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share are not a measure of net income (loss), operating income or any other performance or liquidity measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nCompensation cost for unit and stock based awards is measured based on the fair value of the unit and stock based awards determined by the Black-Scholes option pricing model or the Monte Carlo Simulation Model on the date that the unit-based awards are issued or modified, and is adjusted for the estimated number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. The compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\namortization of $13.4 million, non-cash equity compensation expense of $26.4 million and non-cash changes in fair value of estimated contingent consideration of $23.4 million.\nFrom time to time, we enter into option agreements with wealth management firms (each, an \"Optionee\") and their owners. In exchange for payment of an option premium, the option agreement allows us, at our sole discretion, to acquire substantially all of the assets of the Optionee at a predetermined time and at a predetermined purchase price formula. If we choose to exercise our option, the acquisition and the corresponding management agreement would be executed in accordance with our typical acquisition structure. If we choose not to exercise the option, the option premium would be recorded as a loss on investment in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that the option expires. We have determined that the respective option agreements with the Optionees qualify the Optionees as VIEs. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the Optionees and do not consolidate the results of the Optionees.\nDeferred Revenue\n(4)For periods ended prior to the closing of the IPO and the consummation of the Reorganization Transactions on July 30, 2018, the Adjusted Shares Outstanding are deemed to be outstanding for comparative purposes only.\n\u2022 non-cash equity grants made to employees or non-employees at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time; stock-based compensation expense is not a key measure of our operating performance;\nThe actual increases in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of any redemption of units, the price of our Class A common stock at the time of each redemption, the extent to which such redemptions are taxable transactions, the amount of Focus LLC's assets that consist of equity in entities taxed as corporations at the time of each redemption, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future, the U.S. federal income tax rates then applicable and the portion of the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements that constitute imputed interest or give rise to depreciable or amortizable tax basis.\nThe First Lien Term Loan has a maturity date of July 2024 and initially required quarterly installment repayments of approximately $2.0 million. The First Lien Term Loan was issued at a discount of 0.125% or $1.0 million that we are amortizing to interest expense over the term of the First Lien Term Loan. The First Lien Revolver initially had a maturity date of July 2022 and has no required quarterly installment repayments. Up to $30.0 million of the First Lien Revolver is available for the issuance of letters of credit, subject to certain limitations. The First Lien Term Loan (up to January 2018 as noted below) and First Lien Revolver bore interest (at our option) at: (i) LIBOR plus a margin of 3.25% with the First Lien Revolver having step downs to 3.00% and 2.75% based on achievement of a specified First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined below) or, (ii) the lender's Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Facility) plus a margin of 2.25% with the First Lien Revolver having step downs to 2.00% and 1.75% based on achievement of a specified First Lien Leverage Ratio. The Credit Facility also included an unused commitment fee of 0.50% of the outstanding commitments under the First Lien Revolver, with a stepdown to 0.375% based on achievement of a specified First Lien Leverage Ratio.\nWealth Management Fees", "item_7_tables": "Table 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
