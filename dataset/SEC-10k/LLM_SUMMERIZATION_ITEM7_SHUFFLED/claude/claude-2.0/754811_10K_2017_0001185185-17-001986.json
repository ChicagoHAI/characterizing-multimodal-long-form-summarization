Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion reviews and analyzes the consolidated results of operations of U.S. Global Investors, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, U.S. Global\u201d or the Company\u201d) for the past three fiscal years and other factors that may affect future financial performance. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Selected Financial Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent Trends in Financial Markets\nThe Company's operating revenues are highly correlated to the level of assets under management ( AUM\u201d) and fees associated with various investment products. While AUM is directly impacted by changes in the financial markets, it is also impacted by cash inflows or outflows due to shareholder activity. Performance fees on certain equity fund products may also impact revenues, either positively or negatively. Various products may have different fees, so changes in our product mix may also affect revenues. For example, international equity products will generally have a higher fee than fixed income products, so changes in assets in those products will have a larger impact on revenues.\nWhile products are offered for a wide variety of markets, the Company has traditionally focused on gold mining and exploration, natural resources, and emerging markets. These markets are volatile and cyclical.\nThe rally in gold that began at the start of 2016 and continued into early fall 2016 led to an increase in assets in our gold funds. However, gold then began to stall as investors awaited the results of the U.S. presidential election and anticipated a December rate hike. Immediately following Donald Trump's win, equities took off and the U.S. dollar surged, causing gold to fall out of favor. In addition, in the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the largest junior gold miner ETF reorganized its index methodology, triggering a wave of price weakness throughout the junior gold stocks universe. Junior miners are generally companies in the exploration and development stage. The ETF was getting close to owning 20 percent of the outstanding shares of many of the junior gold mining companies in its index, so its managers chose to downsize their weights in existing holdings and reinvest the proceeds in more mid-tiered gold producers. As our gold funds had investments in most of these same junior gold stocks, this event also had a negative impact on our gold funds towards the end of fiscal year 2017.\nThe Company's emerging markets products experienced favorable conditions. For example, the China region has had strong expansion and gross domestic product (GDP) growth. In addition, key markets in emerging Europe including Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Hungary, are currently among the fastest growing in the world.\nIn addition to its gold, natural resources and emerging markets funds, the Company has domestic equity and fixed income funds in the U.S. and, through a subsidiary, Canada. While these products do not drive the Company's profitability as much as the more specialized products, they provide an opportunity to offer shareholders diversification and less volatility than the niche markets.\nA highly contentious U.S. election cycle concluded with the election of Donald Trump in November 2016. While Congress has had little success so far in delivering on President Trump's political agenda, consumer spending appears to be robust, and domestic financial markets have continued their bull run.\nMutual funds in general continued to see outflows compared to other investment alternatives, including ETFs. In April 2015, the Company launched its first ETF product, the U.S. Global Jets ETF (ticker JETS), which concentrates on the U.S. and international airline industry. The industry experienced a positive market in fiscal year 2017, driven by airlines reporting record profits due to post-financial crisis capacity discipline, depressed labor costs and cheap oil. This led to growth in our Jets ETF assets in fiscal year 2017.\nThe Company launched its second ETF offering in June 2017, the U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (ticker GOAU). This will enable the Company to expand its expertise in precious metals in a different product structure.\nTo manage expenses, the Company maintains a flexible structure for one of its largest costs, compensation expense, by setting relatively low base salaries with bonuses that are tied to fund performance. Thus, our expense model somewhat expands and contracts with asset swings and performance.\nBusiness Segments\nThe Company, with principal operations located in San Antonio, Texas, manages three business segments:\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> 1.\n</td> <td> Investment management services, through which the Company offers, to U.S. Global Investors Funds ( USGIF\u201d or the Fund(s)\u201d), U.S. Global ETFs, and offshore clients, a range of investment management products and services to meet the needs of individual and institutional investors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> 2.\n</td> <td> Investment management services - Canada, through which the Company owns a 65 percent controlling interest in Galileo Global Equity Advisors Inc.

The decrease was primarily due to market depreciation and shareholder redemptions in USGIF, the Galileo Funds and other Canadian advisory clients, somewhat offset by market appreciation of the offshore funds and growth of the ETF clients.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, average AUM was $843 million versus $744 million in fiscal year 2016, an increase of 13.3 percent. The increase was primarily due to market appreciation and shareholder purchases in the gold funds starting in fiscal year 2016 and continuing into the beginning of fiscal year 2017, although that trend started to reverse later in fiscal year 2017 due to sector market conditions.\nThe following is a brief discussion of the Company's three business segments.\nInvestment Management Services\nIn fiscal year 2017, the Company generated a majority of all of its operating revenues from managing and servicing the Funds. The Company recorded advisory and administrative services fees from USGIF totaling approximately $5.2 million and $4.0 million in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. These revenues are largely dependent on the total value and composition of assets under its management. Fluctuations in the markets and investor sentiment directly impact the Funds' asset levels, thereby affecting income and results of operations. Detailed information regarding the Funds managed by the Company within USGIF can be found on the Company's website, www.usfunds.com, including the prospectus and performance information for each Fund. The mutual fund shareholders in USGIF are not required to give advance notice prior to redemption of shares in the Funds, and the USGIF funds do not currently charge a redemption fee.\nThe Company also provides advisory services for two ETFs and receives monthly advisory fees based on the net asset values. The Company recorded advisory fees from the ETF clients totaling $357,000 and $296,000 in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. Information on the ETFs can be found at www.usglobaletfs.com, including the prospectus, performance and holdings. The ETF authorized participants are not required to give advance notice prior to redemption of shares in the ETFs, and the ETFs do not charge a redemption fee.\nThe Company provides advisory services for two offshore clients and receives monthly advisory fees based on the net asset values of the clients and performance fees, if any, based on the overall increase in net asset values. The Company recorded advisory fees from the offshore clients of $135,000 and $91,000 in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. No performance fees from the offshore clients were recorded in fiscal years 2017 and 2016. Frank Holmes, CEO, serves as a director of the two offshore clients. The offshore clients have provided notice that they are liquidating. The liquidations are expected to be completed in September 2017.\nThe following tables summarize the changes in assets under management for USGIF for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015:\nTable 34:

fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, while period-end assets decreased. The increase in average assets under management in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to market appreciation and shareholder purchases in the gold funds starting in fiscal year 2016 and continuing into the beginning of fiscal year 2017. However, assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2017 decreased over the prior year, primarily driven by market depreciation in the gold funds in the latter part of the year and shareholder redemptions in the gold, natural resources and fixed income funds.\nAverage assets under management decreased in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, while period-end assets increased. The decrease in average assets under management in fiscal year 2016 was driven by market depreciation and redemptions, primarily in the natural resources funds, somewhat offset by shareholder purchases in the fixed income funds. However, assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2016 increased over the prior year, primarily driven by market appreciation in the gold funds and shareholder purchases in the fixed income funds.\nBoth average and period-end assets under management decreased in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. The decrease in assets under management in fiscal year 2015 was driven by market depreciation and redemptions, primarily in the natural resources funds, and redemptions in the international equity funds.\nA significant portion of the dividends and distributions shown above are reinvested and included in net shareholder purchases (redemptions).\nThe average annualized investment management fee rate (total advisory fees, excluding performance fees, as a percentage of average assets under management) was 74 basis points in fiscal year 2017, 66 basis points in fiscal year 2016, and 76 basis points in fiscal year 2015. The average investment management fee for equity funds in fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015 was 97, 93 and 95 basis points, respectively. The average investment management fee for the fixed income funds was nil or close to nil for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015. This is due to voluntary fee waivers on these funds as discussed in Note 4 Investment Management and Other Fees in the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvestment Management Services - Canada\nThe Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, U.S. Global Investors (Canada) Limited ( USCAN\u201d), owns 65 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Galileo, a privately held Toronto-based asset management firm, which represented controlling interest of Galileo. The non-controlling interest in this subsidiary is included in non-controlling interest in subsidiary\u201d in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Frank Holmes, CEO, and Susan McGee, President, General Counsel, and Chief Compliance Officer, serve as directors of Galileo.\nCorporate Investments\nManagement believes it can more effectively manage the Company's cash position by maintaining certain types of investments utilized in cash management and continues to believe that such activities are in the best interest of the Company.\nThe following summarizes the market value, cost, and unrealized gain or loss on investments recorded at fair value as of June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016.\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td> Securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Market Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Unrealized Gain (Loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Unrealized gains\non available-for-\nsale securities,\nnet of tax\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trading\u00b9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,720\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,648\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (928\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Available-for-sale\u00b2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,401\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,940\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total at June 30, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,121\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,588\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (467\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trading\u00b9\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,104\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,048\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (944\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Available-for-sale\u00b2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,481\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,436\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total at June 30, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,585\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,484\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (899\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td> 1.\n</td> <td> Unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> 2.\n</td> <td> Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, as of June 30, 2017, and 2016, the Company owned other investments of approximately $2.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively, accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The Company also had invested in notes receivable of approximately $2.2 million and $2.2 million at June 30, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nAs of June 30, 2017, and 2016, the Company held approximately $4.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in investments other than the clients the Company advises. Investments in securities classified as trading are reflected as current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair market value. Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Investments in securities classified as available for sale, which may not be readily marketable, are reflected as non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value.

A significant portion of the unrealized gains and losses is concentrated in a small number of issuers. For fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company had total investment income of $346,000; $485,000; and $434,000, respectively. Due to market volatility, the Company expects that gains or losses will continue to fluctuate in the future.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion of the consolidated

Operations, of $513,000 ($0.03 loss per share) for the year ended June 30, 2017, compared with a net loss attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc. of $3,675,000 ($0.24 loss per share) for the year ended June 30, 2016. The change is mainly due to an increase in revenues, resulting from an increase in average assets under management, and a decrease in expenses, as discussed further below.\nOperating Revenues\nTotal consolidated operating revenues for the year ended June 30, 2017, increased $1.3 million, or 22.9 percent, compared with the year ended June 30, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to the following:\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Advisory fees increased by $1.3 million, or 25.0 percent, as the result of higher assets under management and performance fees received.

The effect of the lower fee rate was somewhat offset by higher average net assets under management upon which these fees are based in the current period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Expenses\nTotal consolidated operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2017, decreased by $2.0 million, or 21.1 percent, compared with the prior year and was primarily attributable to the following:\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Employee compensation and benefits decreased by $1.2 million, or 23.7 percent, primarily as a result of fewer employees in the current period and severance costs paid in the prior year due to a reduction of workforce resulting from the outsourcing of certain functions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> General and administrative expenses decreased $741,000, or 17.5 percent, due to several factors, including lower fund expense reimbursements, primarily as a result of higher average net assets in the current year, the benefit of strategic cost-cutting measures, and nonrecurring USGIF transition costs in the prior year. Costs were incurred in the prior year related to the transition of certain services previously provided to USGIF by the Company to other service providers. The costs of the transition, which included a proxy of USGIF shareholders, were split equally between the Company and USGIF, and the Company's portion was approximately $290,000.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Income\nTotal consolidated other income, which consisted of investment income, for the year ended June 30, 2017, decreased $139,000, or 28.7 percent, compared with the year ended June 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to lower realized net gains on sales of securities of $479,000 offset somewhat by an increase in dividend and interest income of $278,000 and a positive change in unrealized gains/losses on trading securities of $108,000 compared to the prior year.\nDiscontinued Operations\nEffective December 10, 2015, the Company ceased to be the distributor for USGIF and no longer received distribution fees and shareholder services fees from USGIF. Due to this transition, the Company is no longer responsible for paying certain distribution and shareholder servicing related expenses and is reimbursed for certain distribution expenses from the new distributor for USGIF. The operations associated with providing these services are considered discontinued operations. See additional information in Note 17, Discontinued Operations.\nTotal loss, net of tax, on discontinued operations was $18,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. There was no income or loss on discontinued operations for the year ended June 30, 2017.\nYear Ended June 30, 2016, Compared with Year Ended June 30, 2015\nThe Company posted a net loss attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc., as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, of $3.7 million ($0.24 loss per share) for the year ended June 30, 2016, compared with a net loss attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc. of $4.0 million ($0.26 loss per share) for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in net loss is mainly due to a decrease in expenses, offset somewhat by a decrease in revenues resulting primarily from a decrease in assets under management.\nOperating Revenues\nTotal consolidated operating revenues for the year ended June 30, 2016, decreased $1.8 million, or 24.9 percent, compared with the year ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to the following:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Advisory fees decreased by $1.5 million, or 22.4 percent as the result of lower assets under management, somewhat offset by higher ETF advisory fees and lower performance fee payouts.

This increase was primarily attributable to lower unrealized losses on trading securities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, offset somewhat by an increase in other-than-temporary impairment losses and a decrease in dividend and interest income.\nDiscontinued Operations\nEffective December 10, 2015, the Company ceased to be the distributor for USGIF and no longer received distribution fees and shareholder services fees from USGIF. Due to this transition, the Company is no longer responsible for paying certain distribution and shareholder servicing related expenses and is reimbursed for certain distribution expenses from the new distributor for USGIF. The operations associated with providing these services are considered discontinued operations.

Advisory fees, the largest component of the Company's revenues, are derived from four sources: USGIF advisory fees, Galileo advisory fees, exchange-traded fund advisory fees and offshore advisory fees. In fiscal year 2017, these sources accounted for 75.4 percent, 17.0 percent, 5.5 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively, of the Company's total advisory fees.\nInvestment advisory fees from USGIF are calculated as a percentage of average net assets, ranging from 0.375 percent to 1.25 percent, and are paid monthly. These USGIF advisory fees increased by approximately $1.3 million, or 34.5 percent, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in average assets under management driven by market appreciation, primarily in the gold funds. USGIF advisory fees decreased by approximately $885,000, or 19.6 percent, in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily as a result of a decrease in average net assets under management due to market depreciation and redemptions, primarily in the natural resources funds.\nMutual fund investment advisory fees are also affected by changes in assets under management, which include:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> market appreciation or depreciation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the addition of new fund shareholder accounts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> fund shareholder contributions of additional assets to existing accounts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> withdrawals of assets from and termination of fund shareholder accounts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> exchanges of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> the amount of fees voluntarily reimbursed.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe fees on the equity funds within USGIF consist of a base advisory fee that is adjusted upward or downward based on performance. For the years ended June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company adjusted its base advisory fees downward by $49,000; $132,000; and $1.0 million, respectively.\nGalileo provides advisory services for clients in Canada and receives advisory fees based on the net asset values of the clients. Galileo recorded advisory fees from these clients totaling $1.1 million; $1.2 million; and $2.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nThe Company also serves as investment advisor to U.S. Global ETFs. U.S. Global Jets ETF commenced operations in April 2015, and fiscal year 2016 was its first full year of operations. U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF commenced operations in June 2017. The Company receives a unitary management fee of 0.60 percent of average net assets and has agreed to bear all expenses of the ETFs. The Company recorded advisory fees from the ETF clients of $357,000; $296,000; and $26,000 in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nThe Company provides advisory services for two offshore clients and receives monthly advisory fees based on the net asset values of the clients and performance fees, if any, based on the overall increase in net asset values. The Company recorded advisory fees from the offshore clients of $135,000; $91,000; and $130,000 in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. No performance fees from the offshore clients were recorded in fiscal years 2017, 2016, or 2015. Frank Holmes, CEO, serves as a director of the two offshore clients. The offshore clients have provided notice that they are liquidating. The liquidations are expected to be completed in September 2017.\nAdministrative Services Fees. The Funds pay the Company compensation based on average daily net assets for administrative services provided by the Company to the Funds. Prior to November 2014, the Company was compensated for administrative services at an annual rate of 0.10 percent for each investor class and 0.08 percent for each institutional class plus $10,000 per fund. Effective November 1, 2014, the annual per fund fee changed to $7,000. Effective December 10, 2015, the annual rate changed to 0.05 percent for each investor class and to 0.04 percent for each institutional class, and the per fund fee was eliminated. Administrative services fees decreased by $36,000 in fiscal year 2017 due to the changes in the fee structure, somewhat offset by higher average net assets under management upon which these fees are based. Administrative services fees decreased by $331,000 in fiscal year 2016 due to the changes in the fee structure and lower average net assets under management upon which these fees are based.\nInvestment Income (Loss). Investment income (loss) from the Company's investments includes:\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> realized gains and losses on sales of securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> unrealized gains and losses on trading securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> realized foreign currency gains and losses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> other-than-temporary impairments on held-at-cost securities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> dividend and interest income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis source of revenue is dependent on market fluctuations and does not remain at a consistent level. Timing of transactions and the Company's ability to participate in investment opportunities largely affect this source of revenue.\nInvestment income decreased by $139,000 in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to lower realized net gains on sales of securities, offset somewhat by an increase in dividend and interest income and a positive change in unrealized gains/losses on trading securities. Investment income increased by $51,000 in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to lower unrealized losses on trading securities, offset somewhat by an increase in other-than-temporary impairment losses and a decrease in dividend and interest income.\nIncluded in investment income were other-than-temporary impairments totaling $483,000; $517,000; and $247,000 in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The impairment in fiscal year 2017 resulted from fair values of certain equity investments being lower than book value totaling approximately $411,000, and approximately $72,000 in declines in estimated values of securities held at cost. The impairment in fiscal year 2016 resulted from fair values of certain equity investments being lower than book value and a debt security written down to estimated future cash flows based on proposed restructuring totaling approximately $259,000, and approximately $258,000 in declines in estimated values of securities held at cost. The impairment in fiscal year 2015 resulted from issuers defaulting on scheduled payments. One security with a cost basis of $44,000 was written down to its fair value of $5,000. Two other securities were written down to the net present value of estimated future cash flows. These securities had a cost basis of $310,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, and were written down to $234,000 and $970,000, respectively. In making these determinations, the Company considered the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost basis, financial condition and prospects of the issuers, and the Company's ability to hold the investment until recovery.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employee compensation and benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,754\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,918\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (23.7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,918\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,399\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (8.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,494\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,235\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (17.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,235\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,979\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (14.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (36.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 57.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (19.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,636\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,681\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (21.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,681\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,840\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (10.7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits. Employee compensation and benefits decreased $1.2 million, or 23.7 percent, in fiscal year 2017 and decreased $481,000, or 8.9 percent, in fiscal year 2016 as a result of fewer employees and severance costs paid in fiscal year 2016 due to a reduction of workforce resulting from the outsourcing of certain functions.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased $741,000, or 17.5 percent, in fiscal year 2017 due to due to several factors, including lower fund expense reimbursements, primarily as a result of higher average net assets in the current year, the benefit of strategic cost-cutting measures, and nonrecurring USGIF transition costs in the prior year. General and administrative expenses decreased $744,000, or 14.9 percent, in fiscal year 2016 due to strategic expense reductions, offset somewhat by fund proxy-related costs of approximately $290,000.\nAdvertising. Advertising decreased by $77,000, or 36.3 percent, in fiscal year 2017 as a result of a decrease in ETF-related marketing. Advertising increased by $77,000, or 57.0 percent, in fiscal year 2016 as a result of marketing expenses related to the ETF launched in April 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company and its non-Canadian subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. USCAN and Galileo file separate tax returns in Canada. Provisions for income taxes include deferred taxes for temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and tax purposes resulting from the use of the liability method of accounting for income taxes.\nA valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax amount will not be realized. A valuation allowance to fully reserve for the net operating loss carryforward, other carryovers and book/tax differences in the balance sheet is included in deferred taxes in the amount of $3.3 million at June 30, 2017, and $3.1 million at June 30, 2016. In assessing the valuation allowance, the Company considered, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, and the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of contractual obligations of the Company as of June 30, 2017, is as follows:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4-5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,208\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating leases consist of office equipment leased from several vendors and office facilities in Canada. The lease for the office facilities in Canada, included in the table above, was for an original term of five years expiring in June 2018; the lease has been renewed for another five-year term through June 2023. Contractual obligations consist of agreements for services used in daily operations. Other contractual obligations not included in this table consist of agreements to waive or reduce fees and/or pay expenses on certain funds. Future obligations under these agreements are dependent upon future levels of fund assets.\nThe Board of Directors has authorized a monthly dividend of $0.0025 per share from July 2017 through September 2017, at which time the Board of Directors will consider continuation of the dividend. Payment of cash dividends is within the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and is dependent on earnings, operations, capital requirements, general financial condition of the Company, and general business conditions. The total amount of cash dividends to be paid to class A and class C shareholders from July 2017 to September 2017 will be approximately $114,000, which is included as dividends payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt June 30, 2017, the Company had net working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) of approximately $16.3 million and a current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) of 15.0 to 1. With approximately $4.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $13.1 million in securities recorded at fair value, which together comprise approximately 67 percent of total assets, the Company has adequate liquidity to meet its current obligations. Total shareholders' equity attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc. was approximately $23.9 million. Approximately $1.4 million in cash in Galileo is included in the amounts above. The Company could be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate (i.e., bring back into the U.S.) these funds, and there is no current intention to repatriate.\nThe Company has no long-term debt; thus, the Company's only material commitment going forward is for operating expenses. The Company also has access to a $1 million credit facility, which can be utilized for working capital purposes. As of June 30, 2017, this credit facility remained unutilized by the Company.\nInvestment advisory contracts pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 and related affiliated contracts in the U.S., by law, may not exceed one year in length and, therefore, must be renewed at least annually after an initial two-year term. The investment advisory and related contracts between the Company and USGIF expire in September 2017. The Board of Trustees of USGIF will meet to consider the agreement renewals in September 2017. Management anticipates that these agreements will be renewed. The investment advisory contract between the Company and U.S. Global Jets ETF expires in April 2018. The investment advisory contract between the Company and U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF is in its initial two-year term and will not expire until June 2019. Galileo's investment management agreement with Canadian registered mutual funds may be terminated each September 30 with a 180-day prior notice of unitholders' resolution. Galileo's advisory agreements with other advisory clients can be terminated upon 30-day written notice. The Company's two offshore clients have provided notice that they are liquidating. The liquidations are expected to be completed in September 2017; therefore, any fees received in fiscal year 2018 will be minimal.\nThe primary cash requirements are for operating activities. The Company also uses cash to purchase investments, pay dividends and repurchase Company stock. The cash outlays for investments and dividend payments are discretionary and management or the Board may discontinue as deemed necessary. The stock repurchase plan is approved through December 31, 2017. Although the Company had a net loss of $513,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, cash and marketable securities of approximately $17.1 million are available to fund current activities. Certain revenues and expenses have decreased due to the outsourcing in December 2015 certain services previously provided to USGIF to other service providers. The transition has allowed the Company to streamline its responsibilities so it can focus on strategic activities.\nManagement believes current cash reserves, investments, and financing available will be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash needs for operating activities.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company's financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses. Management reviews these estimates on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While recent accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company believes the accounting policies that require management to make assumptions and estimates involving significant judgment are those relating to valuation of investments, income taxes, and valuation of stock-based compensation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: U.S. Global Investors (Bermuda) Limited ( USBERM\u201d), U.S. Global Brokerage, Inc. ( USGB\u201d), U.S. Global Investors (Canada) Limited ( USCAN\u201d) and U.S. Global Indices, LLC.\nThe Company, through USCAN, owns 65 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Galileo and represented controlling interest of Galileo. Galileo is consolidated with USCAN and the non-controlling interest in this subsidiary is included in non-controlling interest in subsidiary\u201d in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThere are two primary consolidation models in U.S. GAAP, the variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) and voting interest entity models. The Company's evaluation for consolidation includes whether entities in which it has an interest or from which it receives fees are VIEs and whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of any VIEs identified in its analysis. A VIE is an entity in which either (a) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its own activities without additional financial support or (b) the group of holders of the equity investment at risk lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has the obligation to absorb a majority of the expected losses or the right to receive the majority of the residual returns and consolidates the VIE on the basis of having a controlling financial interest.\nThe Company holds variable interests in, but is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of, certain funds it advises. The Company's interests in these VIEs consist of the Company's direct ownership therein and any fees earned but uncollected. In the ordinary course of business, the Company may choose to waive certain fees or assume operating expenses of the funds it advises for competitive, regulatory or contractual reasons (see Note 4 Investment Management and Other Fees to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding fee waivers). The Company has not provided financial support to any of these entities outside the ordinary course of business. The Company's risk of loss with respect to these VIEs is limited to the carrying value of its investments in, and fees receivable from, the entities. The Company does not consolidate these VIEs because it is not the primary beneficiary.\nSince the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the funds it advises, the Company evaluated if it should consolidate under the voting interest entity model. Under the voting interest model, for legal entities other than partnerships, the usual condition for control is ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares over an entity. The Company does not have control of any of the funds it advises; therefore, the Company does not consolidate any of these funds.\nInvestments. The Company classifies its investments based on intent at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each reporting period date. The Company records security transactions on trade date. Realized gains (losses) from security transactions are calculated on the first-in/first-out cost basis, unless otherwise identifiable, and are recorded in earnings on the date of sale.\nTrading Securities. Securities that are purchased and held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are included in earnings.\nHeld-to-Maturity Securities. Debt securities that are purchased with the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and measured at amortized cost.\nAvailable-for-sale Securities. Securities that are neither trading securities nor held-to-maturity securities and for which the Company does not have significant influence are classified as available-for-sale securities and reported at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses on these available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings, reported net of tax as a separate component of shareholders' equity, and recorded in earnings when realized.\nThe Company evaluates its available-for-sale investments for other-than-temporary decline in value on a periodic basis. This may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time. When a security in the Company's investment portfolio has an unrealized loss in fair value that is deemed to be other than temporary, the Company reduces the book value of such security to its current fair value, recognizing the credit related decline as a realized loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and a revised GAAP cost basis for the security is established. For available-for-sale securities with declines in value deemed other than temporary, the unrealized loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is realized as a charge to net income.\nOther Investments. Other investments consist of equity investments in entities over which the Company is unable to exercise significant influence and which do not have readily determinable fair values. These equity investments are accounted for under the cost method of accounting and evaluated for impairment. The Company considers many factors in determining impairment, including the severity and duration of the decline in value below cost, the Company's interest and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in value, and the financial condition and specific events related to the issuer. When an impairment of an equity security is determined to be other-than-temporary, the impairment is recognized in earnings.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. The financial instruments of the Company are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at market or fair values or at carrying amounts that approximate fair values.\nNon-Controlling Interests. The Company reports non-controlling interest in subsidiary\u201d as equity, separate from parent's equity, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations includes net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest.\u201d\nIncome Taxes. The Company's annual effective income tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in its U.S. and non-U.S. entities which are part of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, statutory tax rates, and tax-planning opportunities available to the Company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's tax positions.\nTax law requires certain items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements is different from the tax rate reported on the Company's consolidated tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment dates.\nThe Company assesses uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Judgment is used to identify, recognize, and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. A liability is recognized to represent the potential future obligation to the taxing authority for the benefit taken in the tax return. These liabilities are adjusted, including any impact of the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.\nThe Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.\nAssessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns requires judgment. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nStock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award, and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award's vesting period. No options were granted in fiscal years 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nThe Company believes that the estimates related to stock-based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nForeign Exchange. The balance sheets of certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company and certain foreign-denominated investment products are translated at the current exchange rate as of the end of the accounting period and the related income or loss is translated at the average exchange rate in effect during the period. Net exchange gains and losses resulting from balance sheet translations of foreign subsidiaries are excluded from income and are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net exchange gains and losses resulting from income or loss translations are included in income and are recorded in investment income (loss)\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Investment transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate on the date of the transaction and any related gain or loss is included in investment income (loss)\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements. See information regarding accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet adopted by the Company in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "To manage expenses, the Company maintains a flexible structure for one of its largest costs, compensation expense, by setting relatively low base salaries with bonuses that are tied to fund performance. Thus, our expense model somewhat expands and contracts with asset swings and performance.\nIn addition to its gold, natural resources and emerging markets funds, the Company has domestic equity and fixed income funds in the U.S. and, through a subsidiary, Canada. While these products do not drive the Company's profitability as much as the more specialized products, they provide an opportunity to offer shareholders diversification and less volatility than the niche markets.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nTotal consolidated other income for the year ended June 30, 2016, increased $51,000, or 11.8 percent, compared with the year ended June 30, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to lower unrealized losses on trading securities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, offset somewhat by an increase in other-than-temporary impairment losses and a decrease in dividend and interest income.\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td> Securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Market Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Unrealized Gain (Loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Unrealized gains\non available-for-\nsale securities,\nnet of tax\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trading1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,720\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,648\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (928\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Available-for-sale2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,401\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,940\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total at June 30, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,121\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,588\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (467\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trading1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,104\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,048\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (944\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Available-for-sale2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,481\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,436\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total at June 30, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,585\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,484\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (899\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u00b7 other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale securities; \n\nThe following is a brief discussion of the Company's three business segments.\nYear Ended June 30, 2016, Compared with Year Ended June 30, 2015\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td> Assets Under Management ( AUM\u201d)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> June 30, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> June 30, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment Management Services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> USGIF\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 579,416\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 703,020\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Global ETFs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 117,305\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 43,430\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Offshore Advisory Clients\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,213\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,777\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total AUM\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 711,934\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 760,227\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment Management Services - Canada\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Galileo Funds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 46,136\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 48,407\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Advisory Clients\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,651\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 74,437\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total AUM\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47,787\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 122,844\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total AUM\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 759,721\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 883,071\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits.

Other investments consist of equity investments in entities over which the Company is unable to exercise significant influence and which do not have readily determinable fair values. These equity investments are accounted for under the cost method of accounting and evaluated for impairment. The Company considers many factors in determining impairment, including the severity and duration of the decline in value below cost, the Company's interest and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in value, and the financial condition and specific events related to the issuer. When an impairment of an equity security is determined to be other-than-temporary, the impairment is recognized in earnings.\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended June

Realized gains (losses) from security transactions are calculated on the first-in/first-out cost basis, unless otherwise identifiable, and are recorded in earnings on the date of sale.\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employee compensation and benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,754\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,918\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (23.7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,918\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,399\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (8.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,494\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,235\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (17.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,235\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,979\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (14.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advertising\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (36.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 57.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (19.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,636\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,681\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (21.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,681\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,840\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (10.7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fixed Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 442,243\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 148,583\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 590,826\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Market appreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 104,113\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,877\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 106,990\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends and distributions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (14,068\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,625\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (15,693\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net shareholder purchases (redemptions)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (6,510\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 27,407\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20,897\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending Balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 525,778\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 177,242\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 703,020\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average investment management fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.93\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.66\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average net assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 403,424\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,718\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 567,142\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u00b7 withdrawals of assets from and termination of fund shareholder accounts;

The Company recorded advisory fees from the offshore clients of $135,000; $91,000; and $130,000 in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. No performance fees from the offshore clients were recorded in fiscal years 2017, 2016, or 2015. Frank Holmes, CEO, serves as a director of the two offshore clients. The offshore clients have provided notice that they are liquidating. The liquidations are expected to be completed in September 2017.\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4-5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,208\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn June 30, 2017, total AUM as of period end was $760 million versus $883 million on June 30, 2016, a decrease of 14.0 percent. The decrease was primarily due to market depreciation and shareholder redemptions in USGIF, the Galileo Funds and other Canadian advisory clients, somewhat offset by market appreciation of the offshore funds and growth of the ETF clients.\nThe Company evaluates its available-for-sale investments for other-than-temporary decline in value on a periodic basis. This may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time. When a security in the Company's investment portfolio has an unrealized loss in fair value that is deemed to be other than temporary, the Company reduces the book value of such security to its current fair value, recognizing the credit related decline as a realized loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and a revised GAAP cost basis for the security is established. For available-for-sale securities with declines in value deemed other than temporary, the unrealized loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is realized as a charge to net income.\n \u00b7 fund shareholder contributions of additional assets to existing accounts; \nInvestment income (loss) from the Company's investments includes:\nDiscontinued Operations\n\n \u2022 General and administrative expenses decreased $741,000, or 17.5 percent, due to several factors, including lower fund expense reimbursements, primarily as a result of higher average net assets in the current year, the benefit of strategic cost-cutting measures, and nonrecurring USGIF transition costs in the prior year. Costs were incurred in the prior year related to the transition of certain services previously provided to USGIF by the Company to other service providers. The costs of the transition, which included a proxy of USGIF shareholders, were split equally between the Company and USGIF, and the Company's portion was approximately $290,000. \nInvestment Management Services - Canada\nA highly contentious U.S. election cycle concluded with the election of Donald Trump in November 2016. While Congress has had little success so far in delivering on President Trump's political agenda, consumer spending appears to be robust, and domestic financial markets have continued their bull run.\nYear Ended June 30, 2017, Compared with Year Ended June 30, 2016\nThe Company, with principal operations located in San Antonio, Texas, manages three business segments:\n \u00b7 realized foreign currency gains and losses; \n 1. Investment management services, through which the Company offers, to U.S. Global Investors Funds ( USGIF\u201d or the Fund(s)\u201d), U.S. Global ETFs, and offshore clients, a range of investment management products and services to meet the needs of individual and institutional investors; \n\nOperating Revenues\nAvailable-for-sale Securities. Securities that are neither trading securities nor held-to-maturity securities and for which the Company does not have significant influence are classified as available-for-sale securities and reported at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses on these available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings, reported net of tax as a separate component of shareholders' equity, and recorded in earnings when realized.\nA summary of contractual obligations of the Company as of June 30, 2017, is as follows:\nAdvisory Fees. Advisory fees, the largest component of the Company's revenues, are derived from four sources: USGIF advisory fees, Galileo advisory fees, exchange-traded fund advisory fees and offshore advisory fees. In fiscal year 2017, these sources accounted for 75.4 percent, 17.0 percent, 5.5 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively, of the Company's total advisory fees.\n\n o Performance fee adjustments paid out in fiscal 2016 were $868,000 less compared to fiscal 2015. The performance fee is a fulcrum fee that is adjusted upwards or downwards by 0.25 percent when there is a performance difference of 5 percent or more between a fund's performance and that of its designated benchmark index over the prior rolling 12 months. \n \u00b7 other-than-temporary impairments on held-at-cost securities; and \nOther Income\nAdministrative Services Fees. The Funds pay the Company compensation based on average daily net assets for administrative services provided by the Company to the Funds. Prior to November 2014, the Company was compensated for administrative services at an annual rate of 0.10 percent for each investor class and 0.08 percent for each institutional class plus $10,000 per fund. Effective November 1, 2014, the annual per fund fee changed to $7,000. Effective December 10, 2015, the annual rate changed to 0.05 percent for each investor class and to 0.04 percent for each institutional class, and the per fund fee was eliminated. Administrative services fees decreased by $36,000 in fiscal year 2017 due to the changes in the fee structure, somewhat offset by higher average net assets under management upon which these fees are based. Administrative services fees decreased by $331,000 in fiscal year 2016 due to the changes in the fee structure and lower average net assets under management upon which these fees are based.\nThe Company assesses uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Judgment is used to identify, recognize, and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. A liability is recognized to represent the potential future obligation to the taxing authority for the benefit taken in the tax return. These liabilities are adjusted, including any impact of the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.\n o Base management fees increased approximately $1.2 million, primarily as a result of higher average assets under management in USGIF due to market appreciation, primarily in the gold funds. \nLoss attributed to discontinued operations for the distributor for the year ended June 30, 2016, declined $63,000, or 77.8 percent, compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. The fiscal 2015 loss reflects a full year of distribution operations, while the fiscal 2016 loss reflects operations until the transition to the new distributor in December 2015.\nManagement believes it can more effectively manage the Company's cash position by maintaining certain types of investments utilized in cash management and continues to believe that such activities are in the best interest of the Company.\nEffective December 10, 2015, the Company ceased to be the distributor for USGIF and no longer received distribution fees and shareholder services fees from USGIF. Due to this transition, the Company is no longer responsible for paying certain distribution and shareholder servicing related expenses and is reimbursed for certain distribution expenses from the new distributor for USGIF. The operations associated with providing these services are considered discontinued operations. See additional information in Note 17, Discontinued Operations.\n \u00b7 unrealized gains and losses on trading securities; \nThe discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company's financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses. Management reviews these estimates on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While recent accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company believes the accounting policies that require management to make assumptions and estimates involving significant judgment are those relating to valuation of investments, income taxes, and valuation of stock-based compensation.\nThe Company, through USCAN, owns 65 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Galileo and represented controlling interest of Galileo. Galileo is consolidated with USCAN and the non-controlling interest in this subsidiary is included in non-controlling interest in subsidiary\u201d in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n \u00b7 the addition of new fund shareholder accounts; \n \u2022 Advertising increased $77,000, or 57.0 percent, primarily due to marketing costs related to the ETF launched in April 2015. \nIn addition, as of June 30, 2017, and 2016, the Company owned other investments of approximately $2.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively, accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The Company also had invested in notes receivable of approximately $2.2 million and $2.2 million at June 30, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nRecent Trends in Financial Markets\nOperating Expenses\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe Company's emerging markets products experienced favorable conditions. For example, the China region has had strong expansion and gross domestic product (GDP) growth. In addition, key markets in emerging Europe including Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Hungary, are currently among the fastest growing in the world.\nThe following is a discussion of the consolidated results of operations of the Company and a detailed discussion of the Company's revenues and expenses.\nWhile products are offered for a wide variety of markets, the Company has traditionally focused on gold mining and exploration, natural resources, and emerging markets. These markets are volatile and cyclical.\n \u00b7 exchanges of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures; and \n \u2022 Administrative services fees decreased by $331,000, or 50.8 percent, as a result of lower average net assets under management upon which these fees are based and the outsourcing to other service providers a portion of these services previously provided to USGIF. Effective December 10, 2015, due to the Company's reduced administrative responsibilities, the administrative fee paid to the Company by USGIF was decreased. As noted below, the Company has less related expenses due to these reduced responsibilities. \nFair Value of Financial Instruments. The financial instruments of the Company are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at market or fair values or at carrying amounts that approximate fair values.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased $741,000, or 17.5 percent, in fiscal year 2017 due to due to several factors, including lower fund expense reimbursements, primarily as a result of higher average net assets in the current year, the benefit of strategic cost-cutting measures, and nonrecurring USGIF transition costs in the prior year. General and administrative expenses decreased $744,000, or 14.9 percent, in fiscal year 2016 due to strategic expense reductions, offset somewhat by fund proxy-related costs of approximately $290,000.\nThe Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.\nOther Income\nThe Company posted a net loss attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc., as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, of $513,000 ($0.03 loss per share) for the year ended June 30, 2017, compared with a net loss attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc. of $3,675,000 ($0.24 loss per share) for the year ended June 30, 2016. The change is mainly due to an increase in revenues, resulting from an increase in average assets under management, and a decrease in expenses, as discussed further below.\nAs shown above, average assets under management increased in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, while period-end assets decreased. The increase in average assets under management in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to market appreciation and shareholder purchases in the gold funds starting in fiscal year 2016 and continuing into the beginning of fiscal year 2017. However, assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2017 decreased over the prior year, primarily driven by market depreciation in the gold funds in the latter part of the year and shareholder redemptions in the gold, natural resources and fixed income funds.\n \u00b7 other-than-temporary impairments on held-at-cost securities; and \nManagement believes current cash reserves, investments, and financing available will be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash needs for operating activities.\nThis discussion reviews and analyzes the consolidated results of operations of U.S. Global Investors, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, U.S. Global\u201d or the Company\u201d) for the past three fiscal years and other factors that may affect future financial performance. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Selected Financial Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n 2. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized. \nThe Company provides advisory services for two offshore clients and receives monthly advisory fees based on the net asset values of the clients and performance fees, if any, based on the overall increase in net asset values. The Company recorded advisory fees from the offshore clients of $135,000 and $91,000 in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. No performance fees from the offshore clients were recorded in fiscal years 2017 and 2016. Frank Holmes, CEO, serves as a director of the two offshore clients. The offshore clients have provided notice that they are liquidating. The liquidations are expected to be completed in September 2017.\n o Base management fees decreased approximately $2.4 million, primarily as a result of lower assets under management in the USGIF and Galileo funds due to market depreciation and shareholder redemptions. This decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in ETF advisory fees. \nIncome Taxes. The Company's annual effective income tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in its U.S. and non-U.S. entities which are part of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, statutory tax rates, and tax-planning opportunities available to the Company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's tax positions.\nA significant portion of the dividends and distributions shown above are reinvested and included in net shareholder purchases (redemptions).\nTrading Securities. Securities that are purchased and held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are included in earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nInvestment advisory contracts pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 and related affiliated contracts in the U.S., by law, may not exceed one year in length and, therefore, must be renewed at least annually after an initial two-year term. The investment advisory and related contracts between the Company and USGIF expire in September 2017. The Board of Trustees of USGIF will meet to consider the agreement renewals in September 2017. Management anticipates that these agreements will be renewed. The investment advisory contract between the Company and U.S. Global Jets ETF expires in April 2018. The investment advisory contract between the Company and U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF is in its initial two-year term and will not expire until June 2019. Galileo's investment management agreement with Canadian registered mutual funds may be terminated each September 30 with a 180-day prior notice of unitholders' resolution. Galileo's advisory agreements with other advisory clients can be terminated upon 30-day written notice. The Company's two offshore clients have provided notice that they are liquidating. The liquidations are expected to be completed in September 2017; therefore, any fees received in fiscal year 2018 will be minimal.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements. See information regarding accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet adopted by the Company in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvestment income can be volatile and may vary depending on market fluctuations, the Company's ability to participate in investment opportunities, and timing of transactions. A significant portion of the unrealized gains and losses is concentrated in a small number of issuers. For fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company had total investment income of $346,000; $485,000; and $434,000, respectively. Due to market volatility, the Company expects that gains or losses will continue to fluctuate in the future.\nTotal consolidated operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2016, decreased by $1.2 million, or 10.7 percent, compared with the prior year and was primarily attributable to the following:\nHeld-to-Maturity Securities. Debt securities that are purchased with the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and measured at amortized cost.\nTax law requires certain items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements is different from the tax rate reported on the Company's consolidated tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment dates.\n\nAverage assets under management decreased in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, while period-end assets increased. The decrease in average assets under management in fiscal year 2016 was driven by market depreciation and redemptions, primarily in the natural resources funds, somewhat offset by shareholder purchases in the fixed income funds. However, assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2016 increased over the prior year, primarily driven by market appreciation in the gold funds and shareholder purchases in the fixed income funds.\nStock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award, and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award's vesting period. No options were granted in fiscal years 2017, 2016 or 2015.\n \u2022 Advisory fees decreased by $1.5 million, or 22.4 percent as the result of lower assets under management, somewhat offset by higher ETF advisory fees and lower performance fee payouts. USGIF advisory fees are comprised of two components: a base management fee and a performance fee. \nThe Company and its non-Canadian subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. USCAN and Galileo file separate tax returns in Canada. Provisions for income taxes include deferred taxes for temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and tax purposes resulting from the use of the liability method of accounting for income taxes.\nInvestment advisory fees from USGIF are calculated as a percentage of average net assets, ranging from 0.375 percent to 1.25 percent, and are paid monthly. These USGIF advisory fees increased by approximately $1.3 million, or 34.5 percent, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in average assets under management driven by market appreciation, primarily in the gold funds. USGIF advisory fees decreased by approximately $885,000, or 19.6 percent, in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily as a result of a decrease in average net assets under management due to market depreciation and redemptions, primarily in the natural resources funds.\n \u2022 Advisory fees increased by $1.3 million, or 25.0 percent, as the result of higher assets under management and performance fees received. USGIF advisory fees are comprised of two components: a base management fee and a performance fee. \n\nTotal consolidated other income, which consisted of investment income, for the year ended June 30, 2017, decreased $139,000, or 28.7 percent, compared with the year ended June 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to lower realized net gains on sales of securities of $479,000 offset somewhat by an increase in dividend and interest income of $278,000 and a positive change in unrealized gains/losses on trading securities of $108,000 compared to the prior year.\n \u2022 General and administrative expenses decreased $744,000, or 14.9 percent, primarily due to strategic cost cutting measures, offset somewhat by costs of approximately $290,000 in fiscal 2016 related to the USGIF transition to third-party service providers. \nAt June 30, 2017, the Company had net working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) of approximately $16.3 million and a current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) of 15.0 to 1. With approximately $4.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $13.1 million in securities recorded at fair value, which together comprise approximately 67 percent of total assets, the Company has adequate liquidity to meet its current obligations. Total shareholders' equity attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc. was approximately $23.9 million. Approximately $1.4 million in cash in Galileo is included in the amounts above. The Company could be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate (i.e., bring back into the U.S.) these funds, and there is no current intention to repatriate.\nThe Company launched its second ETF offering in June 2017, the U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (ticker GOAU). This will enable the Company to expand its expertise in precious metals in a different product structure.\n 1. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nGalileo provides advisory services for clients in Canada and receives advisory fees based on the net asset values of the clients. Galileo recorded advisory fees from these clients totaling $1.1 million; $1.2 million; and $2.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\n \u00b7 realized gains and losses on sales of securities; \nThe Board of Directors has authorized a monthly dividend of $0.0025 per share from July 2017 through September 2017, at which time the Board of Directors will consider continuation of the dividend. Payment of cash dividends is within the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and is dependent on earnings, operations, capital requirements, general financial condition of the Company, and general business conditions. The total amount of cash dividends to be paid to class A and class C shareholders from July 2017 to September 2017 will be approximately $114,000, which is included as dividends payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2017.\nA valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax amount will not be realized. A valuation allowance to fully reserve for the net operating loss carryforward, other carryovers and book/tax differences in the balance sheet is included in deferred taxes in the amount of $3.3 million at June 30, 2017, and $3.1 million at June 30, 2016. In assessing the valuation allowance, the Company considered, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, and the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods.\nNon-Controlling Interests. The Company reports non-controlling interest in subsidiary\u201d as equity, separate from parent's equity, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations includes net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest.\u201d\nOperating Expenses\nTotal consolidated operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2017, decreased by $2.0 million, or 21.1 percent, compared with the prior year and was primarily attributable to the following:\nThe Company holds variable interests in, but is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of, certain funds it advises. The Company's interests in these VIEs consist of the Company's direct ownership therein and any fees earned but uncollected. In the ordinary course of business, the Company may choose to waive certain fees or assume operating expenses of the funds it advises for competitive, regulatory or contractual reasons (see Note 4 Investment Management and Other Fees to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding fee waivers). The Company has not provided financial support to any of these entities outside the ordinary course of business. The Company's risk of loss with respect to these VIEs is limited to the carrying value of its investments in, and fees receivable from, the entities. The Company does not consolidate these VIEs because it is not the primary beneficiary.\nThe Company also serves as investment advisor to U.S. Global ETFs. U.S. Global Jets ETF commenced operations in April 2015, and fiscal year 2016 was its first full year of operations. U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF commenced operations in June 2017. The Company receives a unitary management fee of 0.60 percent of average net assets and has agreed to bear all expenses of the ETFs. The Company recorded advisory fees from the ETF clients of $357,000; $296,000; and $26,000 in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nBoth average and period-end assets under management decreased in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. The decrease in assets under management in fiscal year 2015 was driven by market depreciation and redemptions, primarily in the natural resources funds, and redemptions in the international equity funds.\nAdvertising. Advertising decreased by $77,000, or 36.3 percent, in fiscal year 2017 as a result of a decrease in ETF-related marketing. Advertising increased by $77,000, or 57.0 percent, in fiscal year 2016 as a result of marketing expenses related to the ETF launched in April 2015.\nThe Company also provides advisory services for two ETFs and receives monthly advisory fees based on the net asset values. The Company recorded advisory fees from the ETF clients totaling $357,000 and $296,000 in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. Information on the ETFs can be found at www.usglobaletfs.com, including the prospectus, performance and holdings. The ETF authorized participants are not required to give advance notice prior to redemption of shares in the ETFs, and the ETFs do not charge a redemption fee.\nForeign Exchange. The balance sheets of certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company and certain foreign-denominated investment products are translated at the current exchange rate as of the end of the accounting period and the related income or loss is translated at the average exchange rate in effect during the period. Net exchange gains and losses resulting from balance sheet translations of foreign subsidiaries are excluded from income and are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net exchange gains and losses resulting from income or loss translations are included in income and are recorded in investment income (loss)\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Investment transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate on the date of the transaction and any related gain or loss is included in investment income (loss)\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nEffective December 10, 2015, the Company ceased to be the distributor for USGIF and no longer received distribution fees and shareholder services fees from USGIF. Due to this transition, the Company is no longer responsible for paying certain distribution and shareholder servicing related expenses and is reimbursed for certain distribution expenses from the new distributor for USGIF. The operations associated with providing these services are considered discontinued operations. See additional information in Note 17, Discontinued Operations.\nBusiness Segments\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following tables summarize the changes in assets under management for USGIF for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015:\nContractual Obligations\nThe following summarizes the market value, cost, and unrealized gain or loss on investments recorded at fair value as of June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016.\nThe Company posted a net loss attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc., as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, of $3.7 million ($0.24 loss per share) for the year ended June 30, 2016, compared with a net loss attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc. of $4.0 million ($0.26 loss per share) for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in net loss is mainly due to a decrease in expenses, offset somewhat by a decrease in revenues resulting primarily from a decrease in assets under management.\nOperating Revenues and Other Income\n\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nIn fiscal year 2017, the Company generated a majority of all of its operating revenues from managing and servicing the Funds. The Company recorded advisory and administrative services fees from USGIF totaling approximately $5.2 million and $4.0 million in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. These revenues are largely dependent on the total value and composition of assets under its management. Fluctuations in the markets and investor sentiment directly impact the Funds' asset levels, thereby affecting income and results of operations. Detailed information regarding the Funds managed by the Company within USGIF can be found on the Company's website, www.usfunds.com, including the prospectus and performance information for each Fund. The mutual fund shareholders in USGIF are not required to give advance notice prior to redemption of shares in the Funds, and the USGIF funds do not currently charge a redemption fee.\n \u00b7 realized gains and losses on sales of securities; \n \u00b7 other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale securities; \n \u00b7 unrealized gains and losses on trading securities; \n \u2022 Employee compensation and benefits decreased by $1.2 million, or 23.7 percent, primarily as a result of fewer employees in the current period and severance costs paid in the prior year due to a reduction of workforce resulting from the outsourcing of certain functions. \nThe primary cash requirements are for operating activities. The Company also uses cash to purchase investments, pay dividends and repurchase Company stock. The cash outlays for investments and dividend payments are discretionary and management or the Board may discontinue as deemed necessary. The stock repurchase plan is approved through December 31, 2017. Although the Company had a net loss of $513,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, cash and marketable securities of approximately $17.1 million are available to fund current activities. Certain revenues and expenses have decreased due to the outsourcing in December 2015 certain services previously provided to USGIF to other service providers. The transition has allowed the Company to streamline its responsibilities so it can focus on strategic activities.\nOperating Expenses\n \u00b7 dividend and interest income. \nInvestment Management Services\nTotal loss, net of tax, on discontinued operations was $18,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. There was no income or loss on discontinued operations for the year ended June 30, 2017.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u00b7 the amount of fees voluntarily reimbursed. \nThis source of revenue is dependent on market fluctuations and does not remain at a consistent level. Timing of transactions and the Company's ability to participate in investment opportunities largely affect this source of revenue.\nThe Company's operating revenues are highly correlated to the level of assets under management ( AUM\u201d) and fees associated with various investment products. While AUM is directly impacted by changes in the financial markets, it is also impacted by cash inflows or outflows due to shareholder activity. Performance fees on certain equity fund products may also impact revenues, either positively or negatively. Various products may have different fees, so changes in our product mix may also affect revenues. For example, international equity products will generally have a higher fee than fixed income products, so changes in assets in those products will have a larger impact on revenues.\nOperating leases consist of office equipment leased from several vendors and office facilities in Canada. The lease for the office facilities in Canada, included in the table above, was for an original term of five years expiring in June 2018; the lease has been renewed for another five-year term through June 2023. Contractual obligations consist of agreements for services used in daily operations. Other contractual obligations not included in this table consist of agreements to waive or reduce fees and/or pay expenses on certain funds. Future obligations under these agreements are dependent upon future levels of fund assets.\n \u2022 Administrative services fees decreased by $36,000, or 11.3 percent, primarily as a result of the current period's fees being subject to a lower rate. Effective December 10, 2015, due to the Company's reduced administrative responsibilities as a result of outsourcing to other service providers a portion of these services previously provided to USGIF, the administrative fee paid to the Company by USGIF was reduced. The effect of the lower fee rate was somewhat offset by higher average net assets under management upon which these fees are based in the current period. \nAssessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns requires judgment. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSince the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the funds it advises, the Company evaluated if it should consolidate under the voting interest entity model. Under the voting interest model, for legal entities other than partnerships, the usual condition for control is ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares over an entity. The Company does not have control of any of the funds it advises; therefore, the Company does not consolidate any of these funds.\nCorporate Investments\nDuring fiscal year 2017, average AUM was $843 million versus $744 million in fiscal year 2016, an increase of 13.3 percent. The increase was primarily due to market appreciation and shareholder purchases in the gold funds starting in fiscal year 2016 and continuing into the beginning of fiscal year 2017, although that trend started to reverse later in fiscal year 2017 due to sector market conditions.\nAs of June 30, 2017, and 2016, the Company held approximately $4.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in investments other than the clients the Company advises. Investments in securities classified as trading are reflected as current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair market value. Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Investments in securities classified as available for sale, which may not be readily marketable, are reflected as non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized.\n 3. Corporate investments, through which the Company invests for its own account in an effort to add growth and value to its cash position. Although the Company generates the majority of its revenues from its investment advisory segments, the Company holds a significant amount of its total assets in investments. \nThe rally in gold that began at the start of 2016 and continued into early fall 2016 led to an increase in assets in our gold funds. However, gold then began to stall as investors awaited the results of the U.S. presidential election and anticipated a December rate hike. Immediately following Donald Trump's win, equities took off and the U.S. dollar surged, causing gold to fall out of favor. In addition, in the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the largest junior gold miner ETF reorganized its index methodology, triggering a wave of price weakness throughout the junior gold stocks universe. Junior miners are generally companies in the exploration and development stage. The ETF was getting close to owning 20 percent of the outstanding shares of many of the junior gold mining companies in its index, so its managers chose to downsize their weights in existing holdings and reinvest the proceeds in more mid-tiered gold producers. As our gold funds had investments in most of these same junior gold stocks, this event also had a negative impact on our gold funds towards the end of fiscal year 2017.\n\nMutual funds in general continued to see outflows compared to other investment alternatives, including ETFs. In April 2015, the Company launched its first ETF product, the U.S. Global Jets ETF (ticker JETS), which concentrates on the U.S. and international airline industry. The industry experienced a positive market in fiscal year 2017, driven by airlines reporting record profits due to post-financial crisis capacity discipline, depressed labor costs and cheap oil. This led to growth in our Jets ETF assets in fiscal year 2017.\nInvestment Income (Loss). Investment income (loss) from the Company's investments includes:\nThe fees on the equity funds within USGIF consist of a base advisory fee that is adjusted upward or downward based on performance. For the years ended June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company adjusted its base advisory fees downward by $49,000; $132,000; and $1.0 million, respectively.\n o Performance fee adjustments paid out in the current period were $49,000 compared to $132,000 paid out in the prior year, a positive difference of $83,000. The performance fee is a fulcrum fee that is adjusted upwards or downwards by 0.25 percent when there is a performance difference of 5 percent or more between a fund's performance and that of its designated benchmark index over the prior rolling 12 months. \nThe Company has no long-term debt; thus, the Company's only material commitment going forward is for operating expenses. The Company also has access to a $1 million credit facility, which can be utilized for working capital purposes. As of June 30, 2017, this credit facility remained unutilized by the Company.\n 2. Investment management services - Canada, through which the Company owns a 65 percent controlling interest in Galileo Global Equity Advisors Inc. ( Galileo\u201d), a privately held Toronto-based asset management firm which offers investment management products and services in Canada; and \n \u00b7 realized foreign currency gains and losses; \nIncluded in investment income were other-than-temporary impairments totaling $483,000; $517,000; and $247,000 in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The impairment in fiscal year 2017 resulted from fair values of certain equity investments being lower than book value totaling approximately $411,000, and approximately $72,000 in declines in estimated values of securities held at cost. The impairment in fiscal year 2016 resulted from fair values of certain equity investments being lower than book value and a debt security written down to estimated future cash flows based on proposed restructuring totaling approximately $259,000, and approximately $258,000 in declines in estimated values of securities held at cost. The impairment in fiscal year 2015 resulted from issuers defaulting on scheduled payments. One security with a cost basis of $44,000 was written down to its fair value of $5,000. Two other securities were written down to the net present value of estimated future cash flows. These securities had a cost basis of $310,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, and were written down to $234,000 and $970,000, respectively. In making these determinations, the Company considered the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost basis, financial condition and prospects of the issuers, and the Company's ability to hold the investment until recovery.\n \u2022 Employee compensation and benefits decreased by $481,000, or 8.9 percent, primarily as a result of lower performance-based bonuses and fewer employees. \n\nThe average annualized investment management fee rate (total advisory fees, excluding performance fees, as a percentage of average assets under management) was 74 basis points in fiscal year 2017, 66 basis points in fiscal year 2016, and 76 basis points in fiscal year 2015. The average investment management fee for equity funds in fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015 was 97, 93 and 95 basis points, respectively. The average investment management fee for the fixed income funds was nil or close to nil for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015. This is due to voluntary fee waivers on these funds as discussed in Note 4 Investment Management and Other Fees in the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThere are two primary consolidation models in U.S. GAAP, the variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) and voting interest entity models. The Company's evaluation for consolidation includes whether entities in which it has an interest or from which it receives fees are VIEs and whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of any VIEs identified in its analysis. A VIE is an entity in which either (a) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its own activities without additional financial support or (b) the group of holders of the equity investment at risk lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has the obligation to absorb a majority of the expected losses or the right to receive the majority of the residual returns and consolidates the VIE on the basis of having a controlling financial interest.\n \u00b7 dividend and interest income. \n \u00b7 market appreciation or depreciation; \nInvestment income decreased by $139,000 in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to lower realized net gains on sales of securities, offset somewhat by an increase in dividend and interest income and a positive change in unrealized gains/losses on trading securities. Investment income increased by $51,000 in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to lower unrealized losses on trading securities, offset somewhat by an increase in other-than-temporary impairment losses and a decrease in dividend and interest income.\nTotal consolidated operating revenues for the year ended June 30, 2016, decreased $1.8 million, or 24.9 percent, compared with the year ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to the following:\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nMutual fund investment advisory fees are also affected by changes in assets under management, which include:\nTotal consolidated operating revenues for the year ended June 30, 2017, increased $1.3 million, or 22.9 percent, compared with the year ended June 30, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to the following:\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: U.S. Global Investors (Bermuda) Limited ( USBERM\u201d), U.S. Global Brokerage, Inc. ( USGB\u201d), U.S. Global Investors (Canada) Limited ( USCAN\u201d) and U.S. Global Indices, LLC.", "item_7_text": "To manage expenses, the Company maintains a flexible structure for one of its largest costs, compensation expense, by setting relatively low base salaries with bonuses that are tied to fund performance. Thus, our expense model somewhat expands and contracts with asset swings and performance.\nIn addition to its gold, natural resources and emerging markets funds, the Company has domestic equity and fixed income funds in the U.S. and, through a subsidiary, Canada. While these products do not drive the Company's profitability as much as the more specialized products, they provide an opportunity to offer shareholders diversification and less volatility than the niche markets.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nTotal consolidated other income for the year ended June 30, 2016, increased $51,000, or 11.8 percent, compared with the year ended June 30, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to lower unrealized losses on trading securities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, offset somewhat by an increase in other-than-temporary impairment losses and a decrease in dividend and interest income.\n \u00b7 other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale securities; \n\nThe following is a brief discussion of the Company's three business segments.\nYear Ended June 30, 2016, Compared with Year Ended June 30, 2015\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits. Employee compensation and benefits decreased $1.2 million, or 23.7 percent, in fiscal year 2017 and decreased $481,000, or 8.9 percent, in fiscal year 2016 as a result of fewer employees and severance costs paid in fiscal year 2016 due to a reduction of workforce resulting from the outsourcing of certain functions.\nOperating Revenues\nOther Investments. Other investments consist of equity investments in entities over which the Company is unable to exercise significant influence and which do not have readily determinable fair values. These equity investments are accounted for under the cost method of accounting and evaluated for impairment. The Company considers many factors in determining impairment, including the severity and duration of the decline in value below cost, the Company's interest and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in value, and the financial condition and specific events related to the issuer. When an impairment of an equity security is determined to be other-than-temporary, the impairment is recognized in earnings.\nThe Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, U.S. Global Investors (Canada) Limited ( USCAN\u201d), owns 65 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Galileo, a privately held Toronto-based asset management firm, which represented controlling interest of Galileo. The non-controlling interest in this subsidiary is included in non-controlling interest in subsidiary\u201d in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Frank Holmes, CEO, and Susan McGee, President, General Counsel, and Chief Compliance Officer, serve as directors of Galileo.\nThe Company believes that the estimates related to stock-based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInvestments. The Company classifies its investments based on intent at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each reporting period date. The Company records security transactions on trade date. Realized gains (losses) from security transactions are calculated on the first-in/first-out cost basis, unless otherwise identifiable, and are recorded in earnings on the date of sale.\nThe Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\n \u00b7 withdrawals of assets from and termination of fund shareholder accounts; \nThe Company provides advisory services for two offshore clients and receives monthly advisory fees based on the net asset values of the clients and performance fees, if any, based on the overall increase in net asset values. The Company recorded advisory fees from the offshore clients of $135,000; $91,000; and $130,000 in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. No performance fees from the offshore clients were recorded in fiscal years 2017, 2016, or 2015. Frank Holmes, CEO, serves as a director of the two offshore clients. The offshore clients have provided notice that they are liquidating. The liquidations are expected to be completed in September 2017.\nOn June 30, 2017, total AUM as of period end was $760 million versus $883 million on June 30, 2016, a decrease of 14.0 percent. The decrease was primarily due to market depreciation and shareholder redemptions in USGIF, the Galileo Funds and other Canadian advisory clients, somewhat offset by market appreciation of the offshore funds and growth of the ETF clients.\nThe Company evaluates its available-for-sale investments for other-than-temporary decline in value on a periodic basis. This may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time. When a security in the Company's investment portfolio has an unrealized loss in fair value that is deemed to be other than temporary, the Company reduces the book value of such security to its current fair value, recognizing the credit related decline as a realized loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and a revised GAAP cost basis for the security is established. For available-for-sale securities with declines in value deemed other than temporary, the unrealized loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is realized as a charge to net income.\n \u00b7 fund shareholder contributions of additional assets to existing accounts; \nInvestment income (loss) from the Company's investments includes:\nDiscontinued Operations\n\n \u2022 General and administrative expenses decreased $741,000, or 17.5 percent, due to several factors, including lower fund expense reimbursements, primarily as a result of higher average net assets in the current year, the benefit of strategic cost-cutting measures, and nonrecurring USGIF transition costs in the prior year. Costs were incurred in the prior year related to the transition of certain services previously provided to USGIF by the Company to other service providers. The costs of the transition, which included a proxy of USGIF shareholders, were split equally between the Company and USGIF, and the Company's portion was approximately $290,000. \nInvestment Management Services - Canada\nA highly contentious U.S. election cycle concluded with the election of Donald Trump in November 2016. While Congress has had little success so far in delivering on President Trump's political agenda, consumer spending appears to be robust, and domestic financial markets have continued their bull run.\nYear Ended June 30, 2017, Compared with Year Ended June 30, 2016\nThe Company, with principal operations located in San Antonio, Texas, manages three business segments:\n \u00b7 realized foreign currency gains and losses; \n 1. Investment management services, through which the Company offers, to U.S. Global Investors Funds ( USGIF\u201d or the Fund(s)\u201d), U.S. Global ETFs, and offshore clients, a range of investment management products and services to meet the needs of individual and institutional investors; \n\nOperating Revenues\nAvailable-for-sale Securities. Securities that are neither trading securities nor held-to-maturity securities and for which the Company does not have significant influence are classified as available-for-sale securities and reported at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses on these available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings, reported net of tax as a separate component of shareholders' equity, and recorded in earnings when realized.\nA summary of contractual obligations of the Company as of June 30, 2017, is as follows:\nAdvisory Fees. Advisory fees, the largest component of the Company's revenues, are derived from four sources: USGIF advisory fees, Galileo advisory fees, exchange-traded fund advisory fees and offshore advisory fees. In fiscal year 2017, these sources accounted for 75.4 percent, 17.0 percent, 5.5 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively, of the Company's total advisory fees.\n\n o Performance fee adjustments paid out in fiscal 2016 were $868,000 less compared to fiscal 2015. The performance fee is a fulcrum fee that is adjusted upwards or downwards by 0.25 percent when there is a performance difference of 5 percent or more between a fund's performance and that of its designated benchmark index over the prior rolling 12 months. \n \u00b7 other-than-temporary impairments on held-at-cost securities; and \nOther Income\nAdministrative Services Fees. The Funds pay the Company compensation based on average daily net assets for administrative services provided by the Company to the Funds. Prior to November 2014, the Company was compensated for administrative services at an annual rate of 0.10 percent for each investor class and 0.08 percent for each institutional class plus $10,000 per fund. Effective November 1, 2014, the annual per fund fee changed to $7,000. Effective December 10, 2015, the annual rate changed to 0.05 percent for each investor class and to 0.04 percent for each institutional class, and the per fund fee was eliminated. Administrative services fees decreased by $36,000 in fiscal year 2017 due to the changes in the fee structure, somewhat offset by higher average net assets under management upon which these fees are based. Administrative services fees decreased by $331,000 in fiscal year 2016 due to the changes in the fee structure and lower average net assets under management upon which these fees are based.\nThe Company assesses uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Judgment is used to identify, recognize, and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. A liability is recognized to represent the potential future obligation to the taxing authority for the benefit taken in the tax return. These liabilities are adjusted, including any impact of the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.\n o Base management fees increased approximately $1.2 million, primarily as a result of higher average assets under management in USGIF due to market appreciation, primarily in the gold funds. \nLoss attributed to discontinued operations for the distributor for the year ended June 30, 2016, declined $63,000, or 77.8 percent, compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. The fiscal 2015 loss reflects a full year of distribution operations, while the fiscal 2016 loss reflects operations until the transition to the new distributor in December 2015.\nManagement believes it can more effectively manage the Company's cash position by maintaining certain types of investments utilized in cash management and continues to believe that such activities are in the best interest of the Company.\nEffective December 10, 2015, the Company ceased to be the distributor for USGIF and no longer received distribution fees and shareholder services fees from USGIF. Due to this transition, the Company is no longer responsible for paying certain distribution and shareholder servicing related expenses and is reimbursed for certain distribution expenses from the new distributor for USGIF. The operations associated with providing these services are considered discontinued operations. See additional information in Note 17, Discontinued Operations.\n \u00b7 unrealized gains and losses on trading securities; \nThe discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company's financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses. Management reviews these estimates on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While recent accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company believes the accounting policies that require management to make assumptions and estimates involving significant judgment are those relating to valuation of investments, income taxes, and valuation of stock-based compensation.\nThe Company, through USCAN, owns 65 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Galileo and represented controlling interest of Galileo. Galileo is consolidated with USCAN and the non-controlling interest in this subsidiary is included in non-controlling interest in subsidiary\u201d in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n \u00b7 the addition of new fund shareholder accounts; \n \u2022 Advertising increased $77,000, or 57.0 percent, primarily due to marketing costs related to the ETF launched in April 2015. \nIn addition, as of June 30, 2017, and 2016, the Company owned other investments of approximately $2.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively, accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The Company also had invested in notes receivable of approximately $2.2 million and $2.2 million at June 30, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nRecent Trends in Financial Markets\nOperating Expenses\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe Company's emerging markets products experienced favorable conditions. For example, the China region has had strong expansion and gross domestic product (GDP) growth. In addition, key markets in emerging Europe including Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Hungary, are currently among the fastest growing in the world.\nThe following is a discussion of the consolidated results of operations of the Company and a detailed discussion of the Company's revenues and expenses.\nWhile products are offered for a wide variety of markets, the Company has traditionally focused on gold mining and exploration, natural resources, and emerging markets. These markets are volatile and cyclical.\n \u00b7 exchanges of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures; and \n \u2022 Administrative services fees decreased by $331,000, or 50.8 percent, as a result of lower average net assets under management upon which these fees are based and the outsourcing to other service providers a portion of these services previously provided to USGIF. Effective December 10, 2015, due to the Company's reduced administrative responsibilities, the administrative fee paid to the Company by USGIF was decreased. As noted below, the Company has less related expenses due to these reduced responsibilities. \nFair Value of Financial Instruments. The financial instruments of the Company are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at market or fair values or at carrying amounts that approximate fair values.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased $741,000, or 17.5 percent, in fiscal year 2017 due to due to several factors, including lower fund expense reimbursements, primarily as a result of higher average net assets in the current year, the benefit of strategic cost-cutting measures, and nonrecurring USGIF transition costs in the prior year. General and administrative expenses decreased $744,000, or 14.9 percent, in fiscal year 2016 due to strategic expense reductions, offset somewhat by fund proxy-related costs of approximately $290,000.\nThe Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.\nOther Income\nThe Company posted a net loss attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc., as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, of $513,000 ($0.03 loss per share) for the year ended June 30, 2017, compared with a net loss attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc. of $3,675,000 ($0.24 loss per share) for the year ended June 30, 2016. The change is mainly due to an increase in revenues, resulting from an increase in average assets under management, and a decrease in expenses, as discussed further below.\nAs shown above, average assets under management increased in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, while period-end assets decreased. The increase in average assets under management in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to market appreciation and shareholder purchases in the gold funds starting in fiscal year 2016 and continuing into the beginning of fiscal year 2017. However, assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2017 decreased over the prior year, primarily driven by market depreciation in the gold funds in the latter part of the year and shareholder redemptions in the gold, natural resources and fixed income funds.\n \u00b7 other-than-temporary impairments on held-at-cost securities; and \nManagement believes current cash reserves, investments, and financing available will be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash needs for operating activities.\nThis discussion reviews and analyzes the consolidated results of operations of U.S. Global Investors, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, U.S. Global\u201d or the Company\u201d) for the past three fiscal years and other factors that may affect future financial performance. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Selected Financial Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n 2. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized. \nThe Company provides advisory services for two offshore clients and receives monthly advisory fees based on the net asset values of the clients and performance fees, if any, based on the overall increase in net asset values. The Company recorded advisory fees from the offshore clients of $135,000 and $91,000 in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. No performance fees from the offshore clients were recorded in fiscal years 2017 and 2016. Frank Holmes, CEO, serves as a director of the two offshore clients. The offshore clients have provided notice that they are liquidating. The liquidations are expected to be completed in September 2017.\n o Base management fees decreased approximately $2.4 million, primarily as a result of lower assets under management in the USGIF and Galileo funds due to market depreciation and shareholder redemptions. This decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in ETF advisory fees. \nIncome Taxes. The Company's annual effective income tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in its U.S. and non-U.S. entities which are part of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, statutory tax rates, and tax-planning opportunities available to the Company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's tax positions.\nA significant portion of the dividends and distributions shown above are reinvested and included in net shareholder purchases (redemptions).\nTrading Securities. Securities that are purchased and held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are included in earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nInvestment advisory contracts pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 and related affiliated contracts in the U.S., by law, may not exceed one year in length and, therefore, must be renewed at least annually after an initial two-year term. The investment advisory and related contracts between the Company and USGIF expire in September 2017. The Board of Trustees of USGIF will meet to consider the agreement renewals in September 2017. Management anticipates that these agreements will be renewed. The investment advisory contract between the Company and U.S. Global Jets ETF expires in April 2018. The investment advisory contract between the Company and U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF is in its initial two-year term and will not expire until June 2019. Galileo's investment management agreement with Canadian registered mutual funds may be terminated each September 30 with a 180-day prior notice of unitholders' resolution. Galileo's advisory agreements with other advisory clients can be terminated upon 30-day written notice. The Company's two offshore clients have provided notice that they are liquidating. The liquidations are expected to be completed in September 2017; therefore, any fees received in fiscal year 2018 will be minimal.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements. See information regarding accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet adopted by the Company in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvestment income can be volatile and may vary depending on market fluctuations, the Company's ability to participate in investment opportunities, and timing of transactions. A significant portion of the unrealized gains and losses is concentrated in a small number of issuers. For fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company had total investment income of $346,000; $485,000; and $434,000, respectively. Due to market volatility, the Company expects that gains or losses will continue to fluctuate in the future.\nTotal consolidated operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2016, decreased by $1.2 million, or 10.7 percent, compared with the prior year and was primarily attributable to the following:\nHeld-to-Maturity Securities. Debt securities that are purchased with the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and measured at amortized cost.\nTax law requires certain items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements is different from the tax rate reported on the Company's consolidated tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment dates.\n\nAverage assets under management decreased in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, while period-end assets increased. The decrease in average assets under management in fiscal year 2016 was driven by market depreciation and redemptions, primarily in the natural resources funds, somewhat offset by shareholder purchases in the fixed income funds. However, assets under management as of the end of fiscal year 2016 increased over the prior year, primarily driven by market appreciation in the gold funds and shareholder purchases in the fixed income funds.\nStock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award, and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award's vesting period. No options were granted in fiscal years 2017, 2016 or 2015.\n \u2022 Advisory fees decreased by $1.5 million, or 22.4 percent as the result of lower assets under management, somewhat offset by higher ETF advisory fees and lower performance fee payouts. USGIF advisory fees are comprised of two components: a base management fee and a performance fee. \nThe Company and its non-Canadian subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. USCAN and Galileo file separate tax returns in Canada. Provisions for income taxes include deferred taxes for temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and tax purposes resulting from the use of the liability method of accounting for income taxes.\nInvestment advisory fees from USGIF are calculated as a percentage of average net assets, ranging from 0.375 percent to 1.25 percent, and are paid monthly. These USGIF advisory fees increased by approximately $1.3 million, or 34.5 percent, in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in average assets under management driven by market appreciation, primarily in the gold funds. USGIF advisory fees decreased by approximately $885,000, or 19.6 percent, in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily as a result of a decrease in average net assets under management due to market depreciation and redemptions, primarily in the natural resources funds.\n \u2022 Advisory fees increased by $1.3 million, or 25.0 percent, as the result of higher assets under management and performance fees received. USGIF advisory fees are comprised of two components: a base management fee and a performance fee. \n\nTotal consolidated other income, which consisted of investment income, for the year ended June 30, 2017, decreased $139,000, or 28.7 percent, compared with the year ended June 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to lower realized net gains on sales of securities of $479,000 offset somewhat by an increase in dividend and interest income of $278,000 and a positive change in unrealized gains/losses on trading securities of $108,000 compared to the prior year.\n \u2022 General and administrative expenses decreased $744,000, or 14.9 percent, primarily due to strategic cost cutting measures, offset somewhat by costs of approximately $290,000 in fiscal 2016 related to the USGIF transition to third-party service providers. \nAt June 30, 2017, the Company had net working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) of approximately $16.3 million and a current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) of 15.0 to 1. With approximately $4.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $13.1 million in securities recorded at fair value, which together comprise approximately 67 percent of total assets, the Company has adequate liquidity to meet its current obligations. Total shareholders' equity attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc. was approximately $23.9 million. Approximately $1.4 million in cash in Galileo is included in the amounts above. The Company could be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate (i.e., bring back into the U.S.) these funds, and there is no current intention to repatriate.\nThe Company launched its second ETF offering in June 2017, the U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (ticker GOAU). This will enable the Company to expand its expertise in precious metals in a different product structure.\n 1. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nGalileo provides advisory services for clients in Canada and receives advisory fees based on the net asset values of the clients. Galileo recorded advisory fees from these clients totaling $1.1 million; $1.2 million; and $2.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\n \u00b7 realized gains and losses on sales of securities; \nThe Board of Directors has authorized a monthly dividend of $0.0025 per share from July 2017 through September 2017, at which time the Board of Directors will consider continuation of the dividend. Payment of cash dividends is within the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and is dependent on earnings, operations, capital requirements, general financial condition of the Company, and general business conditions. The total amount of cash dividends to be paid to class A and class C shareholders from July 2017 to September 2017 will be approximately $114,000, which is included as dividends payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2017.\nA valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax amount will not be realized. A valuation allowance to fully reserve for the net operating loss carryforward, other carryovers and book/tax differences in the balance sheet is included in deferred taxes in the amount of $3.3 million at June 30, 2017, and $3.1 million at June 30, 2016. In assessing the valuation allowance, the Company considered, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, and the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods.\nNon-Controlling Interests. The Company reports non-controlling interest in subsidiary\u201d as equity, separate from parent's equity, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations includes net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest.\u201d\nOperating Expenses\nTotal consolidated operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2017, decreased by $2.0 million, or 21.1 percent, compared with the prior year and was primarily attributable to the following:\nThe Company holds variable interests in, but is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of, certain funds it advises. The Company's interests in these VIEs consist of the Company's direct ownership therein and any fees earned but uncollected. In the ordinary course of business, the Company may choose to waive certain fees or assume operating expenses of the funds it advises for competitive, regulatory or contractual reasons (see Note 4 Investment Management and Other Fees to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding fee waivers). The Company has not provided financial support to any of these entities outside the ordinary course of business. The Company's risk of loss with respect to these VIEs is limited to the carrying value of its investments in, and fees receivable from, the entities. The Company does not consolidate these VIEs because it is not the primary beneficiary.\nThe Company also serves as investment advisor to U.S. Global ETFs. U.S. Global Jets ETF commenced operations in April 2015, and fiscal year 2016 was its first full year of operations. U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF commenced operations in June 2017. The Company receives a unitary management fee of 0.60 percent of average net assets and has agreed to bear all expenses of the ETFs. The Company recorded advisory fees from the ETF clients of $357,000; $296,000; and $26,000 in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nBoth average and period-end assets under management decreased in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. The decrease in assets under management in fiscal year 2015 was driven by market depreciation and redemptions, primarily in the natural resources funds, and redemptions in the international equity funds.\nAdvertising. Advertising decreased by $77,000, or 36.3 percent, in fiscal year 2017 as a result of a decrease in ETF-related marketing. Advertising increased by $77,000, or 57.0 percent, in fiscal year 2016 as a result of marketing expenses related to the ETF launched in April 2015.\nThe Company also provides advisory services for two ETFs and receives monthly advisory fees based on the net asset values. The Company recorded advisory fees from the ETF clients totaling $357,000 and $296,000 in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. Information on the ETFs can be found at www.usglobaletfs.com, including the prospectus, performance and holdings. The ETF authorized participants are not required to give advance notice prior to redemption of shares in the ETFs, and the ETFs do not charge a redemption fee.\nForeign Exchange. The balance sheets of certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company and certain foreign-denominated investment products are translated at the current exchange rate as of the end of the accounting period and the related income or loss is translated at the average exchange rate in effect during the period. Net exchange gains and losses resulting from balance sheet translations of foreign subsidiaries are excluded from income and are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net exchange gains and losses resulting from income or loss translations are included in income and are recorded in investment income (loss)\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Investment transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate on the date of the transaction and any related gain or loss is included in investment income (loss)\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nEffective December 10, 2015, the Company ceased to be the distributor for USGIF and no longer received distribution fees and shareholder services fees from USGIF. Due to this transition, the Company is no longer responsible for paying certain distribution and shareholder servicing related expenses and is reimbursed for certain distribution expenses from the new distributor for USGIF. The operations associated with providing these services are considered discontinued operations. See additional information in Note 17, Discontinued Operations.\nBusiness Segments\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following tables summarize the changes in assets under management for USGIF for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015:\nContractual Obligations\nThe following summarizes the market value, cost, and unrealized gain or loss on investments recorded at fair value as of June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016.\nThe Company posted a net loss attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc., as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, of $3.7 million ($0.24 loss per share) for the year ended June 30, 2016, compared with a net loss attributable to U.S. Global Investors, Inc. of $4.0 million ($0.26 loss per share) for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in net loss is mainly due to a decrease in expenses, offset somewhat by a decrease in revenues resulting primarily from a decrease in assets under management.\nOperating Revenues and Other Income\n\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nIn fiscal year 2017, the Company generated a majority of all of its operating revenues from managing and servicing the Funds. The Company recorded advisory and administrative services fees from USGIF totaling approximately $5.2 million and $4.0 million in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. These revenues are largely dependent on the total value and composition of assets under its management. Fluctuations in the markets and investor sentiment directly impact the Funds' asset levels, thereby affecting income and results of operations. Detailed information regarding the Funds managed by the Company within USGIF can be found on the Company's website, www.usfunds.com, including the prospectus and performance information for each Fund. The mutual fund shareholders in USGIF are not required to give advance notice prior to redemption of shares in the Funds, and the USGIF funds do not currently charge a redemption fee.\n \u00b7 realized gains and losses on sales of securities; \n \u00b7 other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale securities; \n \u00b7 unrealized gains and losses on trading securities; \n \u2022 Employee compensation and benefits decreased by $1.2 million, or 23.7 percent, primarily as a result of fewer employees in the current period and severance costs paid in the prior year due to a reduction of workforce resulting from the outsourcing of certain functions. \nThe primary cash requirements are for operating activities. The Company also uses cash to purchase investments, pay dividends and repurchase Company stock. The cash outlays for investments and dividend payments are discretionary and management or the Board may discontinue as deemed necessary. The stock repurchase plan is approved through December 31, 2017. Although the Company had a net loss of $513,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, cash and marketable securities of approximately $17.1 million are available to fund current activities. Certain revenues and expenses have decreased due to the outsourcing in December 2015 certain services previously provided to USGIF to other service providers. The transition has allowed the Company to streamline its responsibilities so it can focus on strategic activities.\nOperating Expenses\n \u00b7 dividend and interest income. \nInvestment Management Services\nTotal loss, net of tax, on discontinued operations was $18,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016. There was no income or loss on discontinued operations for the year ended June 30, 2017.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u00b7 the amount of fees voluntarily reimbursed. \nThis source of revenue is dependent on market fluctuations and does not remain at a consistent level. Timing of transactions and the Company's ability to participate in investment opportunities largely affect this source of revenue.\nThe Company's operating revenues are highly correlated to the level of assets under management ( AUM\u201d) and fees associated with various investment products. While AUM is directly impacted by changes in the financial markets, it is also impacted by cash inflows or outflows due to shareholder activity. Performance fees on certain equity fund products may also impact revenues, either positively or negatively. Various products may have different fees, so changes in our product mix may also affect revenues. For example, international equity products will generally have a higher fee than fixed income products, so changes in assets in those products will have a larger impact on revenues.\nOperating leases consist of office equipment leased from several vendors and office facilities in Canada. The lease for the office facilities in Canada, included in the table above, was for an original term of five years expiring in June 2018; the lease has been renewed for another five-year term through June 2023. Contractual obligations consist of agreements for services used in daily operations. Other contractual obligations not included in this table consist of agreements to waive or reduce fees and/or pay expenses on certain funds. Future obligations under these agreements are dependent upon future levels of fund assets.\n \u2022 Administrative services fees decreased by $36,000, or 11.3 percent, primarily as a result of the current period's fees being subject to a lower rate. Effective December 10, 2015, due to the Company's reduced administrative responsibilities as a result of outsourcing to other service providers a portion of these services previously provided to USGIF, the administrative fee paid to the Company by USGIF was reduced. The effect of the lower fee rate was somewhat offset by higher average net assets under management upon which these fees are based in the current period. \nAssessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns requires judgment. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSince the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the funds it advises, the Company evaluated if it should consolidate under the voting interest entity model. Under the voting interest model, for legal entities other than partnerships, the usual condition for control is ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares over an entity. The Company does not have control of any of the funds it advises; therefore, the Company does not consolidate any of these funds.\nCorporate Investments\nDuring fiscal year 2017, average AUM was $843 million versus $744 million in fiscal year 2016, an increase of 13.3 percent. The increase was primarily due to market appreciation and shareholder purchases in the gold funds starting in fiscal year 2016 and continuing into the beginning of fiscal year 2017, although that trend started to reverse later in fiscal year 2017 due to sector market conditions.\nAs of June 30, 2017, and 2016, the Company held approximately $4.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in investments other than the clients the Company advises. Investments in securities classified as trading are reflected as current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair market value. Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Investments in securities classified as available for sale, which may not be readily marketable, are reflected as non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized.\n 3. Corporate investments, through which the Company invests for its own account in an effort to add growth and value to its cash position. Although the Company generates the majority of its revenues from its investment advisory segments, the Company holds a significant amount of its total assets in investments. \nThe rally in gold that began at the start of 2016 and continued into early fall 2016 led to an increase in assets in our gold funds. However, gold then began to stall as investors awaited the results of the U.S. presidential election and anticipated a December rate hike. Immediately following Donald Trump's win, equities took off and the U.S. dollar surged, causing gold to fall out of favor. In addition, in the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the largest junior gold miner ETF reorganized its index methodology, triggering a wave of price weakness throughout the junior gold stocks universe. Junior miners are generally companies in the exploration and development stage. The ETF was getting close to owning 20 percent of the outstanding shares of many of the junior gold mining companies in its index, so its managers chose to downsize their weights in existing holdings and reinvest the proceeds in more mid-tiered gold producers. As our gold funds had investments in most of these same junior gold stocks, this event also had a negative impact on our gold funds towards the end of fiscal year 2017.\n\nMutual funds in general continued to see outflows compared to other investment alternatives, including ETFs. In April 2015, the Company launched its first ETF product, the U.S. Global Jets ETF (ticker JETS), which concentrates on the U.S. and international airline industry. The industry experienced a positive market in fiscal year 2017, driven by airlines reporting record profits due to post-financial crisis capacity discipline, depressed labor costs and cheap oil. This led to growth in our Jets ETF assets in fiscal year 2017.\nInvestment Income (Loss). Investment income (loss) from the Company's investments includes:\nThe fees on the equity funds within USGIF consist of a base advisory fee that is adjusted upward or downward based on performance. For the years ended June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company adjusted its base advisory fees downward by $49,000; $132,000; and $1.0 million, respectively.\n o Performance fee adjustments paid out in the current period were $49,000 compared to $132,000 paid out in the prior year, a positive difference of $83,000. The performance fee is a fulcrum fee that is adjusted upwards or downwards by 0.25 percent when there is a performance difference of 5 percent or more between a fund's performance and that of its designated benchmark index over the prior rolling 12 months. \nThe Company has no long-term debt; thus, the Company's only material commitment going forward is for operating expenses. The Company also has access to a $1 million credit facility, which can be utilized for working capital purposes. As of June 30, 2017, this credit facility remained unutilized by the Company.\n 2. Investment management services - Canada, through which the Company owns a 65 percent controlling interest in Galileo Global Equity Advisors Inc. ( Galileo\u201d), a privately held Toronto-based asset management firm which offers investment management products and services in Canada; and \n \u00b7 realized foreign currency gains and losses; \nIncluded in investment income were other-than-temporary impairments totaling $483,000; $517,000; and $247,000 in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The impairment in fiscal year 2017 resulted from fair values of certain equity investments being lower than book value totaling approximately $411,000, and approximately $72,000 in declines in estimated values of securities held at cost. The impairment in fiscal year 2016 resulted from fair values of certain equity investments being lower than book value and a debt security written down to estimated future cash flows based on proposed restructuring totaling approximately $259,000, and approximately $258,000 in declines in estimated values of securities held at cost. The impairment in fiscal year 2015 resulted from issuers defaulting on scheduled payments. One security with a cost basis of $44,000 was written down to its fair value of $5,000. Two other securities were written down to the net present value of estimated future cash flows. These securities had a cost basis of $310,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, and were written down to $234,000 and $970,000, respectively. In making these determinations, the Company considered the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost basis, financial condition and prospects of the issuers, and the Company's ability to hold the investment until recovery.\n \u2022 Employee compensation and benefits decreased by $481,000, or 8.9 percent, primarily as a result of lower performance-based bonuses and fewer employees. \n\nThe average annualized investment management fee rate (total advisory fees, excluding performance fees, as a percentage of average assets under management) was 74 basis points in fiscal year 2017, 66 basis points in fiscal year 2016, and 76 basis points in fiscal year 2015. The average investment management fee for equity funds in fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015 was 97, 93 and 95 basis points, respectively. The average investment management fee for the fixed income funds was nil or close to nil for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015. This is due to voluntary fee waivers on these funds as discussed in Note 4 Investment Management and Other Fees in the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThere are two primary consolidation models in U.S. GAAP, the variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d) and voting interest entity models. The Company's evaluation for consolidation includes whether entities in which it has an interest or from which it receives fees are VIEs and whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of any VIEs identified in its analysis. A VIE is an entity in which either (a) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its own activities without additional financial support or (b) the group of holders of the equity investment at risk lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has the obligation to absorb a majority of the expected losses or the right to receive the majority of the residual returns and consolidates the VIE on the basis of having a controlling financial interest.\n \u00b7 dividend and interest income. \n \u00b7 market appreciation or depreciation; \nInvestment income decreased by $139,000 in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to lower realized net gains on sales of securities, offset somewhat by an increase in dividend and interest income and a positive change in unrealized gains/losses on trading securities. Investment income increased by $51,000 in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to lower unrealized losses on trading securities, offset somewhat by an increase in other-than-temporary impairment losses and a decrease in dividend and interest income.\nTotal consolidated operating revenues for the year ended June 30, 2016, decreased $1.8 million, or 24.9 percent, compared with the year ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to the following:\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nMutual fund investment advisory fees are also affected by changes in assets under management, which include:\nTotal consolidated operating revenues for the year ended June 30, 2017, increased $1.3 million, or 22.9 percent, compared with the year ended June 30, 2016.

assets under management (AUM). Fluctuations in AUM impact revenues.\n\n- AUM increased 13.3% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, driven by market appreciation and shareholder purchases in gold funds. However, AUM decreased 14.0% at end of fiscal 2017 vs end of fiscal 2016 due to market depreciation and shareholder redemptions.\n\n- Total revenues increased 22.9% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher advisory fees from increased average AUM. \n\n- Net loss attributable to the Company was $513,000 in fiscal 2017 compared to $3.7 million net loss in fiscal 2016. The reduced loss was mainly due to increased revenues and decreased expenses.\n\n- Expenses decreased 21.1% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower employee compensation with fewer employees and lower fund expense reimbursements. \n\n- Investment income decreased 28.7% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower realized gains on sales of securities.\n\n- The Company has adequate liquidity to fund current operations with $17.1 million in cash and marketable securities."}
