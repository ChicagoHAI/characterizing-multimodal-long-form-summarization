Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCautionary Statements Concerning Forward-Looking Statements. The statements made in this Form 10-K, other materials the Company has filed or may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in each case that are not historical facts, contain forward-looking information\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended, which can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may,\u201d will,\u201d anticipates,\u201d expects,\u201d projects,\u201d estimates,\u201d believes,\u201d seeks,\u201d could,\u201d should,\u201d or continue,\u201d the negative thereof, and other variations or comparable terminology as well as statements regarding the evaluation of strategic alternatives and liquidation contingencies. These forward-looking statements are based on the current plans and expectations of management and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to our efforts to enhance the values of our remaining major properties and seek the orderly, opportunistic sale and liquidation of such properties as soon as reasonably practicable, the effect of economic and business conditions, risks inherent in the real estate markets of Suffolk and Westchester Counties in New York, the ability to obtain additional capital in order to enhance the value of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties, risks and uncertainties associated with any litigation that may develop in connection with our efforts to sell our properties opportunistically, including related enhancement efforts, and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports. These and other matters the Company discusses in this Report, or in the documents it incorporates by reference into this Report, may cause actual results to differ from those the Company describes. The Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nOverview\nAs used herein, the terms we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or the Company\u201d refer to Gyrodyne LLC, the succeeding company of the merger of Gyrodyne Company of America, Inc. and Gyrodyne Special Distribution, LLC with and into the Company. We operate as a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate company (prior to the Merger, a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d)) focused on pursuing entitlements/re-zoning, owning, leasing and managing medical, commercial and industrial real estate. Our tenants include unrelated diversified entities with a recent emphasis on medical office parks and properties. Our properties are located in Suffolk and Westchester counties in New York, which are characterized by strong real estate markets.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the consolidated portfolio consisted of three developed properties, consisting of 11 buildings with an aggregate of 167,620 rentable square feet. The Company also owns undeveloped land parcels adjacent to existing properties for which alternative entitlement and zoning plans are currently being considered in order to enhance the value of the relevant primary property.\nFactors Which May Influence Future Operations\nOur operating focus is on maximizing cashflows and market value of our operating properties while we are securing entitlements and zoning modifications with the objective of enhancing the value of our remaining major properties and maximizing liquidating distributions to our shareholders as soon as reasonably practicable. As of December 31, 2017, our properties were 69% leased to 42 tenants. As of December 31, 2016, on a pro forma basis to exclude assets sold through December 31, 2017, our properties were 77% leased to 48 tenants. The year over year decrease in the gross portfolio occupancy percentage is primarily the result of tenants terminated at Flowerfield to reposition the industrial park with an expanded leasing relationship with Stony Brook University. The expanded relationship is synergistic with the potential value associated with the entitlements being pursued on the undeveloped land. The Company believes the two-pronged strategy of pursuing entitlements while expanding the relationship with Stony Brook University will support our strategic goal of maximizing the estimated liquidating distributions via maximizing the real estate value of our remaining portfolio. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the Company has almost doubled the space we are leasing relationship to Stony Brook University which is a contributing factor to the increase in value of the real estate reported in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets.\nOur leasing strategy for 2018 includes focusing on leasing vacant space, negotiating early renewals for leases scheduled to expire through 2018 and identifying new tenants or existing tenants seeking additional space. A core part of our leasing strategy is to expand our leasing relationship with New York Presbyterian Hudson Valley Medical Center and Stony Brook University which border the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center and the Flowerfield Industrial Park, respectively. We believe expanding the leasing relationships with these institutions will enhance the post entitlement values of the respective properties as well as the current value of the developed portion of the Flowerfield Industrial Park.\nLease Expirations\nThe following is a summary of lease expirations and related revenues of leases in place at December 31, 2017. This table assumes that none of the tenants exercise renewal options or early termination rights, if any, at or prior to the scheduled expirations:\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of Gross Annual\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Number of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Square\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Rental Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Feet\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Annual\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Represented\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fiscal Year End\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Expiring\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Expiring\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Rent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> By Such Leases\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>546,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.18% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>925,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.01% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.51% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>138,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.86% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>290,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.44% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe success of our leasing strategy will be dependent upon the general economic conditions and more specifically real estate market conditions and trends in the United States and in our target markets of Suffolk and Westchester Counties in New York. We cannot give any assurance that leases will be renewed or that available space will be re-leased at rental rates equal to or above the current contractual rental rates.\nWe actively manage the renewal process in conjunction with a third-party asset management firm. Historically, this has resulted in a very low turnover rate with our tenants. As a result, the Company continues to actively manage lease termination dates and often approaches tenants up to one year in advance to gauge renewal interest and negotiate related leases. Where a termination is likely, the Company begins marketing the property prior to termination to timely identify the market rent for the specific space, expected vacancy period and market demanded tenant concessions and incentives. During 2017, the Company provided approximately $72,700 in incentives in the form of tenant improvements and lease concessions in the form of rent abatement of approximately $25,000. The aforementioned incentives resulted in total lease commitments of approximately $570,000.\nThe Company may offer tenant concessions in the form of rent abatements rather than tenant improvements to maximize its working capital position. However, tenant improvement incentives may be offered in certain cases where concessions are not effective in meeting the demands of the existing or prospective tenant.\nDuring 2017, the Company incurred approximately $34,000 in leasing fees and commissions in exchange for revenue commitments of approximately $555,000 with leases ranging from 2 years to 5 years. The leasing fees reflect a renewal cost rate of 6.1% of the related revenue commitments. The Company often renews leases without external brokers or other third-party costs which during 2017 resulted in an additional $937,000 in lease commitments. As a result, the total lease commitments signed during 2017 was approximately $1.5 million. The Company has approximately 27% of its annual leasing revenue up for renewal in 2017, which compares unfavorably to 24% of leases up for renewal in 2016. General economic conditions, coupled with rental markets in which we operate, will dictate how rental rates on new leases and renewals will compare, favorably or unfavorably, to those leases that were signed in 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGyrodyne is pursuing the opportunistic disposition of certain properties and the enhancement of the value of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties, by pursuing various zoning/entitlement opportunities, which the Gyrodyne Board believes will improve the chances of obtaining better values for such properties. Gyrodyne intends to dissolve after it completes the disposition of all of its real property assets, applies the proceeds of such dispositions first to settle any debts and claims, pending or otherwise, against Gyrodyne, and then makes liquidating distributions to holders of Gyrodyne common shares. Therefore, effective September 1, 2015 Gyrodyne adopted the liquidation basis of accounting. This basis of accounting is considered appropriate when, among other things, liquidation of the entity is imminent, as defined in ASC 205-30, Presentation of Financial Statements Liquidation Basis of Accounting. Under the LLC Agreement, the Board may elect, in its sole discretion and without any separate approval by shareholders, to dissolve the Company at any time the value of the Company's assets, as determined by the Board in good faith, is less than $1 million. The LLC Agreement also provides that the Company will dissolve, and its affairs wound up upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of all the real properties of the Company. As a result, liquidation is imminent\u201d in accordance with the guidance provided in ASC 205-30.\nPrinciples of consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Gyrodyne and all subsidiaries. All consolidated subsidiaries are wholly-owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nBasis of Presentation - Liquidation Basis of Accounting - Under the liquidation basis of accounting the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of operations, statement of equity, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the consolidated statement of cash flows are no longer presented. The consolidated statement of net assets in liquidation and the consolidated statement of changes in net assets are the principal financial statements presented under the liquidation basis of accounting.\nUnder the liquidation basis of accounting, all the Company's assets have been stated at their estimated net realizable value, or liquidation value, (which represents the estimated amount of cash that Gyrodyne will collect on the disposal of assets as it carries out the plan of liquidation), which is based on current contracts, estimates and other indications of sales value (predicated on current values). All liabilities of the Company, including those estimated costs associated with implementing the plan of liquidation, have been stated at their estimated settlement amounts. These amounts are presented in the accompanying statements of net assets. These estimates are periodically reviewed and adjusted as appropriate. There can be no assurance that these estimated values will be realized. Such amounts should not be taken as an indication of the timing or amount of future distributions or our actual dissolution. The valuation of assets at their net realizable value and liabilities at their anticipated settlement amount represent estimates, based on present facts and circumstances, of the net realizable value of the assets and the costs associated with carrying out the plan of liquidation. The actual values and costs associated with carrying out the plan of liquidation may differ from amounts reflected in the accompanying financial statements because of the plan's inherent uncertainty. These differences may be material. In particular, the estimates of our costs will vary with the length of time necessary to complete the plan of liquidation, which is currently anticipated to be completed by the end of 2019. The Company is in the process of pursuing entitlements, density and/or rezoning, and our ability to obtain required permits and authorizations is subject to factors beyond our control, including environmental concerns of governmental entities and community groups. The process will involve extensive analysis internally at the government entity level, as well as between government entities such as town planning departments and Gyrodyne, and will continue up until such time as entitlement, rezoning and density decisions are made by the relevant government entities. We hope to secure favorable decisions on entitlements, rezoning and density so that we can then seek the sale of our remaining properties at higher prices (than those achievable under their current entitlements) and then proceed with the liquidation and dissolution of the Company. The Company expects the process of pursuing entitlements, rezoning and density could take up to two years with the ultimate timing to a certain extent managed by Gyrodyne but ultimately dependent and under the control of the applicable municipality's planning board or other governmental authority. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict with certainty the timing or aggregate amount which may ultimately be distributed to common shareholders and no assurance can be given that the distributions will equal or exceed the estimate presented in the accompanying Statement of Net Assets.\nThe Company is pursuing value associated with the highest and best use for Flowerfield and the Cortlandt Medical Center. The actual costs of achieving such values may differ materially from the assumptions and estimates utilized and accordingly, could have a significant impact on the value of net assets.\nThe Company's assumptions and estimates (including the sales proceeds of all its real estate holdings, selling costs, retention bonus payments, rental revenues, rental expenses, capital expenditures, land entitlement/re-zoning costs, general and administrative fees, director and officer liability and reimbursement, post liquidation insurance tail coverage policy and final liquidation costs) are based on completing the liquidation by the end of 2019. As previously stated, on an ongoing basis, Gyrodyne evaluates the estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the reported net assets in liquidation and will update accordingly for any costs and value associated with a change in the duration of the liquidation, as we cannot give any assurance on the timing of the ultimate sale of all the Company's properties.\nManagement Estimates - In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d) and the liquidation basis of accounting, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, including net assets in liquidation, and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of receipts and expenditures for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe most significant estimates are the estimates on the net realizable value from the sale of our real estate, the estimated costs/time to pursue entitlements/change of zone and the related timeline to complete the liquidation.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts - Rent receivable is carried at net realizable value. Management makes estimates of the collectability of rents receivable. Management specifically analyzes receivables and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nCash equivalents - The Company considers all certificates of deposits, money market funds, treasury securities and other highly liquid debt instruments purchased with short-term maturities to be cash equivalents.\nIncome taxes - The Company follows the guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This guidance, among other things, creates a two-step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. Recognition (step one) occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that more-likely-than-not will be realized upon settlement. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. This interpretation specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions, and it has expanded disclosure requirements. The Company believes it is more likely than not that its tax positions will be sustained in any tax examinations. The Company has no income tax expense, deferred tax assets or liabilities, associated with any such uncertain tax positions. The Company's open tax years are 2014, 2015, and 2016.\nTax legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017, makes numerous changes to the tax rules. For example, the top federal income tax rate for individuals is reduced to 37%, there is a new deduction available for certain Qualified Business Income, that reduces the top effective tax rate applicable to ordinary dividends from REITs to 29.6% (through a 20% deduction for ordinary REIT dividends received) and various deductions are eliminated or limited. Most of the changes applicable to individuals are temporary. There are only minor changes to the REIT rules (other than the 20% deduction applicable to individuals for ordinary REIT dividends received). To date, the Internal Revenue Service has issued only limited guidance on the changes made by the new legislation. It is unclear at this time whether Congress will address these issues or when the Internal Revenue Service will issue additional administrative guidance on the changes made by the new legislation.\nFair Value Measurements - The Company believes the concepts for determining net realizable value are consistent with the guidance for measuring fair value. As a result, the Company follows the guidance of FASB Accounting Standards Codification, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures to determine the fair value of financial and non-financial instruments. The guidance defines fair value, establishes a hierarchy framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures related to the fair value. The guidance establishes a hierarchy breaking down observable and unobservable inputs into three levels: Level 1 - observable inputs in an active market on or around the measurement date, Level 2 - observable inputs that are based on prices not quoted on active markets but corroborated by market data and Level 3 - unobservable inputs utilized when no other data is available.\nNew accounting pronouncements - Management has evaluated the impact of newly issued accounting pronouncements, whether effective or not as of December 31, 2017, and has concluded that they will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements since the Company reports on a liquidation basis.\nDiscussion of the Statement of Net Assets\nNet assets in liquidation at December 31, 2017 would result in estimated liquidating distributions of approximately $17.97 per common share. This increase of $0.01 from the December 31, 2016 net assets in liquidation of $17.96 per common share, net of the $1.00 per share special distribution paid in July 2017, is the result of increased property valuations offset by the tenant improvements required for a lease expansion with an existing tenant in the industrial park.\nThe cash balance at the end of the liquidation period (currently estimated to be December 31, 2019, although the estimated completion of the liquidation period may change), excluding any interim distributions, is estimated based on the December 31, 2017 cash balance of $5.3 million plus adjustments for the following items which are estimated through December 31, 2019:\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> 1.\n</td> <td> Adjustments for the estimated cash receipts from the operation of the properties net of rental property related expenditures as well as costs expected to be incurred to preserve or improve the net realizable value of the property at its estimated gross sales proceeds.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> 2.\n</td> <td> Proceeds from the sale of all the Company's real estate holdings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> 3.\n</td> <td> The net cash used to settle the working capital accounts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> 4.\n</td> <td> The general and administrative expenses and or liabilities associated with operations and the liquidation of the Company including severance, director and officer liability inclusive of post liquidation tail policy coverage, and financial and legal fees to complete the liquidation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> 5.\n</td> <td> Costs for the pursuit of the entitlement/rezoning of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties, to maximize value\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> 6.\n</td> <td> Estimated amounts based on the net realizable value of the real estate under the Retention Bonus Plan.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> 7.\n</td> <td> Proceeds from the draw downs on the debt facility to fund tenant improvements and costs to repay such outstanding debt.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company estimates the net realizable value of its real estate assets by using income and market valuation techniques. The Company may estimate net realizable values using market information such as broker opinions of value, appraisals, and recent sales data for similar assets or discounted cash flow models, which primarily rely on Level 3 inputs. The cash flow models include estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period. These cash flows may include contractual rental revenues, projected future rental revenues and expenses and forecasted tenant improvements and lease commissions based upon market conditions determined through discussion with local real estate professionals, experience the Company has with its other owned properties in such markets and expectations for growth. Capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are estimated by management based upon rates that management believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective properties based upon an analysis of factors such as property and tenant quality, geographical location and local supply and demand observations. To the extent the Company under estimates forecasted cash outflows (tenant improvements, lease commissions and operating costs) or over estimates forecasted cash inflows (rental revenue rates), the estimated net realizable value of its real estate assets could be overstated.\nThe Company is pursuing various avenues to maximize total distributions to our shareholders during the liquidation process. The Company estimates that it will incur approximately $2.5 million (included in the statements of net assets as part of the estimated liquidation and operating costs net of receipts) in land entitlement/re-zoning costs over the two years ended December 31, 2019, inclusively, in an effort to obtain entitlements, inclusive of zone changes and special permits. The Company believes the commitment of these resources will enable the Company to position the properties for sale with all entitlements necessary to maximize the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor property values. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred approximately $1.7 million of land entitlement/re-zoning costs, of which approximately $353,000 was for the purchase of a single-family residence on a 0.3-acre lot of adjacent land to the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center, inclusive of closing costs. The Company believes the remaining balance of $2.5 million will be incurred from January 2018 through the end of liquidation. The Company does not intend to develop the properties but rather to commit resources to position the properties for sale in a timely manner with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction values. The costs and time frame to achieve the entitlements could change due to a range of factors including a shift in the value of certain entitlements making it more profitable to pursue a different mix of zones/entitlements and the dynamics of the real estate market. As a result, the Company has focused and will continue to focus its land entitlement/re-zoning efforts on achieving the highest and best use. During the process of pursuing such entitlements, the Company may entertain offers from potential buyers who may be willing to pay premiums for the properties that the Company finds more acceptable from a timing or value perspective than completing the entitlement processes itself. The value of the real estate reported in the Statements of Net Assets as of December 31, 2017 (predicated on current asset values) does not include any potential value impact that may result from the estimated $2.5 million in land entitlement/re-zoning costs. There can be no assurance that our value enhancement efforts will result in property value increases that exceed the costs we incur in such efforts, or even any increase at all.\nThe Company is making tenant improvements at Flowerfield to convert certain existing industrial space into office space to meet our expanding relationship with Stony Brook University, which the Company believes will enhance the value of the property as a whole by improving the building space and drawing a high quality long-term tenant. It would also increase the synergy with the University and allow for a portion of the trip generation from this office space to be accommodated using the internal access point between the properties. The Company believes that the planned tenant improvements for leases signed in the first quarter of 2018 will cost approximately $1 million and that we are financing the cost of such tenant improvements with a credit facility, rather than using our cash on hand. To finance the tenant improvements, we secured a non-revolving credit line with a bank for up to $3 million, with the first advance of up to $1.1 million to be used to finance the foregoing tenant improvements with Stony Brook Hospital. The balance of the credit line would be available for improvements under a lease with Stony Brook University or its affiliates or other tenant spaces with bank approval. There can be no assurance that the Flowerfield property will increase in value as a result of the tenant improvements or that any resulting increase in value of the Flowerfield property will exceed the cost of our planned tenant improvements including the cost of the related financing.\nThe net assets in liquidation at December 31, 2017 ($26,637,350) results in estimated liquidating distributions of approximately $17.97 per common share (based on 1,482,680 shares outstanding), based on estimates and other indications of sales value but excluding any actual additional sales proceeds that may result directly or indirectly from our land entitlement/re-zoning efforts. Neither the additional value that may be derived from the land entitlement/re-zoning costs, nor the retention bonuses for the sale of the Flowerfield property are included in the estimated liquidating distributions as of December 31, 2017. The Company believes the land entitlement/re-zoning costs will enhance estimated distributions per share through the improved values from the sales of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties. This estimate of liquidating distributions includes projections of costs and expenses to be incurred during the period required to complete the plan of liquidation. There is inherent uncertainty with these projections, and they could change materially based on the timing of the sales, improved values of the Cortlandt Manor and/or Flowerfield properties resulting from the land entitlement/re-zoning efforts net of any bonuses if such values exceed the minimum values required to pay bonuses under the retention bonus plan, favorable or unfavorable changes in the land entitlement/re-zoning costs, the performance of the underlying assets, the market for commercial real estate properties generally and any changes in the underlying assumptions of the projected cash flows.\nThe following table summarizes the estimates to arrive at the Net Assets in Liquidation as of December 31, 2017 (dollars are in millions).\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> December 31, 2017 cash and cash equivalents balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income offset by net cash used to settle current working capital acct and security deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.00 </td> <td>) </td> <td> (i)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Free cash flow from rental operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.07 </td> <td>) </td> <td> (ii)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses including final liquidation and dissolution\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.55 </td> <td>) </td> <td> (iii)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land entitlement/re-zoning costs in pursuit of the highest and best use\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.52 </td> <td>) </td> <td> (iv)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross real estate proceeds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling costs on real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.98 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retention bonus plan for directors, officers and employees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.64 </td> <td>) </td> <td> (v)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.43 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directors and officers insurance ( D&O\u201d) - tail policy\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.45 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.01 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Assets in Liquidation\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.64 </td> <td> </td> <td> (vi)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> (i)\n</td> <td> The Company estimates interest income will be offset by the settlement of its working capital accounts resulting in a balance of $(1.00).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> (ii)\n</td> <td> The Company estimates the cash outflows from rental operations net of commissions and rental costs, inclusive of expenditures to preserve or improve the properties at its current estimated market value and rental income, will total $(0.07).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> (iii)\n</td> <td> The General and Administrative expenses are estimated to be $4.55.

However, if the Company concludes in future periodic filings that the value of the real estate to the extent actual net proceeds from the ultimate disposition of the properties exceed the value of the real estate reported in the Statement of Net Assets as of December 31, 2017, and such net proceeds exceeds the minimum value required to pay bonuses under the retention bonus plan (whether due to appreciation of the underlying real estate and/or a reduction in estimated land entitlement/re-zoning costs), then the Company will report the updated estimated real estate value and the estimated bonuses related to such value of the Flowerfield property in accordance with the provisions of the retention bonus plan.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td> (vi)\n</td> <td> The net assets in liquidation at December 31, 2017 would result in liquidating distributions of approximately $17.97 per common share ($26.6 million with 1,482,680 shares outstanding), excluding any additional sales proceeds, that may result directly or indirectly from the remaining $2.5 million in land entitlement/re-zoning costs.

There is inherent uncertainty with these projections, and they could change materially based on the timing of the sales, favorable or unfavorable changes in the land entitlement/re-zoning costs, the performance of the underlying assets and any changes in the underlying assumptions of the projected cash flows.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDiscussion of Changes in Net Assets\nGyrodyne's strategy is to enhance the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor, by pursuing various zoning or entitlement opportunities, which the Gyrodyne Board believes will improve the chances of obtaining better values for such properties. The pursuit of the highest and best use of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor may involve the acquisition of properties, pursuit of joint venture relationships and other investments and or other strategies to maximize the returns for our shareholders. Gyrodyne intends to dissolve after it completes the disposition of all of its real property assets, applies the proceeds of such dispositions first to settle any debts and claims, pending or otherwise, against Gyrodyne, and then makes liquidating distributions to holders of Gyrodyne common shares. Therefore, the Company includes in its financial statements the Statement of Changes in Net Assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, all of which is discussed below:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> Net assets in liquidation at January 1, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,455,577 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in net assets in liquidation from January 1 through December 31, 2016:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in market value of securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,424 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remeasurement of assets and liabilities in liquidation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (1,707,731)\n</td> <td>(a) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in value of real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,336,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total change in net assets in liquidation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>594,845 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less liquidating distributions paid to shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,938,810 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net assets in liquidation at December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,111,612 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in net assets in liquidation for the year ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in market value of securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,918 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remeasurement of assets and liabilities in liquidation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (4,809,165)\n</td> <td>(a) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in value of real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,791,665 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total change in net assets in liquidation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.418 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less liquidation distributions paid to shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,482,680 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net assets in liquidation at December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,637,350 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) The re-measurement of the assets and liabilities in liquidation during 2016 of $1,707,731 is mainly driven by the increased land entitlement/re-zoning costs and general and administrative expense required for the pursuit of the highest value in Cortlandt Manor and Flowerfield, offset by income from operations on the remaining properties and the change in retention bonus payments. The change in 2017 of $4,809,165 is mainly driven by the increased land entitlement/re-zoning costs and general and administrative expense required for the pursuit of the highest value in Cortlandt Manor and Flowerfield, offset by income from operations on the remaining properties and the change in retention bonus payments. Furthermore, the Company changed the timeline necessary to complete the research and related rezoning/entitlement efforts from the end of the 2018 to 2019. While the Company has and expects to continue to substantially reduce the rental expenses as assets are sold, the loss in the free cash flow from these properties to fund its operations and land entitlement/re-zoning efforts through 2019, the revised estimated date of dissolution has resulted in the majority of the remaining $4.79 million change in liabilities in excess of receipts.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows:\nAs we pursue our plan to sell our properties opportunistically, including certain enhancement efforts, we believe that a main focus of management is to effectively manage our net assets through cash flow management of our tenant leases, maintaining or improving occupancy, and enhance the value of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties via the pursuit of the associated change in zone/entitlements.\nAs the Company executes on the sale of assets, it will no less than annually, review its capital needs and declare and distribute any excess cash, accordingly. Upon completion of these activities, if successful, Gyrodyne will distribute the remaining cash to its shareholders and then proceed to complete the dissolution of the Company, delist its shares from Nasdaq or other exchange platform and terminate its registration and reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as Amended (the Exchange Act\u201d). Gyrodyne is required to make adequate provisions to satisfy its known and unknown liabilities which could substantially delay or limit its ability to make future distributions to shareholders. The process of accounting for liabilities, including those that are currently unknown or whose amounts are uncertain may involve difficult valuation decisions which could adversely impact the amount or timing of any future distributions.\nEven if we are successful in maintaining compliance with applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, our board of directors may decide that the costs of compliance and the demands of management time and Company resources required to maintain our Nasdaq listing are greater than the benefits received by the Company and its shareholders from being a listed company and that, accordingly, consistent with other cash management and cost reduction measures that we have implemented, we should voluntarily delist from the Nasdaq Capital Market. If our common shares were delisted from Nasdaq voluntarily or involuntarily, trading of our common shares most likely will be conducted in the over-the-counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as OTCQX, OTCBX or OTC Pink which will reduce the market liquidity of our common shares. Delisting may result in lower levels of ownership and trading by institutional shareholders, who are generally guided by quantitative and qualitative investment standards such as market capitalization, minimum share price and liquidity, which in turn often produces lower trading volumes and reduced liquidity. As a result, an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common shares. Also, many brokers will not allow customers to hold non-listed securities in managed accounts or place restrictions which inhibit holding or trading, and it is generally understood that brokers will not recommend non-listed securities to retail clients, perhaps not as official policy but rather as a practical reality. We cannot assure you that our common shares, if delisted from Nasdaq voluntarily, or if they would be delisted involuntarily by Nasdaq, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the counter quotation system.\nWe generally finance our operations and acquisitions through cash on hand. However, we entered into a credit facility on March 21, 2018 that will provide up to $3.0 million in financing for tenant improvements pursuant to certain leases with Stony Brook University. The balance of the loan can only be drawn upon to finance tenant improvements if required in the event, the Company signs additional leases or lease expansions with Stony Brook University or its affiliates (or other improvements subject to the bank's approval) anytime during the Interest-Only Phase. We believe leveraging our tenant improvements will allow us to continue focusing our cash on funding the pursuit of entitlements and our operations. The Company believes the combination of the investments in tenant improvements related to strategically important leases and the pursuit of entitlements will enable the Company to maximize the ultimate real estate value and the distributions per share.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $5.3 million. The Company anticipates that its current cash and cash equivalent balance will be adequate to fund its liquidation process and dissolution over the next twelve months. The $5.3 million of cash will be partially used to fund our efforts to generate the highest values for the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties while simultaneously pursuing the opportunistic sale of these properties. The pursuit to generate the highest values of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor may involve the acquisition of properties, pursuit of joint venture relationships, entitlements and/or zoning changes and other investments and or other strategies to maximize the returns for our shareholders. The Company is estimating and reporting in the Statement of Net Assets total gross cash proceeds from the sale of its assets of approximately $33.0 million. Based on the Company's current cash balance and the above forecast, the Company estimates distributable cash stemming from the liquidation of the Company of approximately $26.6 million.\nThe Company's primary sources of funds which are limited and expected to narrow as we liquidate properties and make distributions are as follows:\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> current cash and cash equivalents;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> rents and tenant reimbursements received on our remaining real estate operating assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> sale of assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> credit facility earmarked for tenant improvements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExcluding gross proceeds from the sale of assets, the Company's gross rents and tenant reimbursements net of rental expenses is less than the combined total annual general and administrative costs, capital expenditures and land entitlement/re-zoning costs creating a net use of cash on an annual basis through the liquidation process. The Company believes the cash and cash equivalents plus the proceeds from the sale of assets and funds available through its credit facility will exceed the costs to complete the liquidation of the Company. In addition, the Company has and will continue to review operating activities for possible cost reductions throughout the liquidation process.\nThe Company's primary non-operating cashflows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are as follows:\nOur primary sources of non-operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of the following:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $2,590,645 in net proceeds from the sale of 3 of our buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur primary non-operating uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2017 were as follows:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $1,482,680 for payment of liquidating distributions to our common shareholders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $736,867 of costs incurred in the pursuit of entitlements for Cortlandt Manor inclusive of the land purchase;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $981,254 of costs incurred in the pursuit of entitlements for Flowerfield; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $565,584 of capital expenditures on the real estate portfolio excluding those costs incurred under the land entitlement/re-zoning effort.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur primary sources of non-operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the following:\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $13,300,833 in net proceeds from the sale of the Fairfax Medical Center;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $3,981,842 in net proceeds from the sale of 5 of our buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $881,066 in principal repayments on the investment in mortgage backed securities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur primary non-operating uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2016 were as follows:\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $15,938,810 for payment of liquidating distributions to our common shareholders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $452,517 of costs incurred in the pursuit of entitlements for Cortlandt Manor inclusive of the land purchase;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $444,557 of costs incurred in the pursuit of entitlements for Flowerfield; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> $426,658 of capital expenditures on the real estate portfolio excluding those costs incurred under the land entitlement/re-zoning effort.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe continued economic challenges for small businesses, including the lack of available credit to many of our tenant classes who are small businesses and the uncertainty facing medical tenants brought about by the 2010 Federal health care reform legislation, recent changes impacting such legislation and the current legislative environment could adversely affect our operating results and accordingly the estimated cash proceeds from the liquidation process.\nAcquisitions:\nOn April 20, 2017, the Company closed on the purchase of a 1,950-square foot single-family residential dwelling located on approximately 0.3 acres in Cortlandt Manor, New York. The purchase price, inclusive of closing costs, was approximately $353,000. The Company was able to take advantage of a distressed sale following foreclosure action by the lender. The property which adjoins the Cortlandt Medical Center and is across the street from New York Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital Center, is expected to become part of the Cortlandt Manor MOD. The property may provide additional vehicular access to the site from Buttonwood Drive and State Route 202 and additional parking which the Company believes will further increase the yield in a manner that is cost effective and should provide a significant return on investment to the shareholders.\nIn March 2016, the Company acquired a four-acre undeveloped lot, in Cortlandt Manor, for $210,000, including related costs which the company believes is synergistic to maximizing the value on its property.\nDispositions:\nPort Jefferson Professional Park.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company closed on the sale of three and five buildings (approximately 4,000 square feet each), respectively, in the Port Jefferson Professional Park as follows:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> Port Jefferson Professional\nPark Location\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Closing Date\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Gross Sales Proceeds\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> 5380 Nesconset Highway\n</td> <td> </td> <td> June, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> 9 Medical Drive\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> 1 Medical Drive\n</td> <td> </td> <td> August 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>800,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> 6 Medical Drive\n</td> <td> </td> <td> January 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>850,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> 8 Medical Drive\n</td> <td> </td> <td> June 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>820,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> 4 Medical Drive\n</td> <td> </td> <td> July 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>900,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> 3 Medical Drive\n</td> <td> </td> <td> August 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>876,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> 2 Medical Drive\n</td> <td> </td> <td> September 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>800,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,800,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,246,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFollowing the sales indicated above, the Company has one remaining building (comprising approximately 3,500 square feet in total) within the same medical park which is being actively marketed for sale.\nFairfax Medical Center.\nOn May 4th, 2016, the Company sold the Fairfax Medical Center for $14,015,000.\nSince the commencement of our liquidation process, the Company has completed the sale of ten properties for gross aggregate proceeds of over $21.8 million. Although we have not released or disclosed the appraised values of our individual real estate holdings so as not to put the Company in a negotiating disadvantage, the gross proceeds achieved in each such sale have been in excess of the appraised value of the respective property.\nUnder the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement (the \"Settlement\") relating to the class action litigation against the Company, Gyrodyne agreed that any sales of its properties would be effected only in arm's-length transactions at prices at or above their December 2014 appraised values. The 2014 appraised value for the properties in the aggregate was approximately $100,000 higher than the 2013 aggregate appraised value for such properties used to value the interests of GSD, then a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation into which all of the Corporation's properties were transferred, and whose shares were distributed to the Corporation's shareholders. As of December 31, 2017, the appraised value in the aggregate of the remaining unsold properties was $4,416,665 higher than the 2014 appraised values. See, Risk Factors -- Stipulation of Settlement prohibits us from selling our remaining properties at prices below the December 2014 appraised values\u201d.\nSpecial Distributions:\nOn May 26, 2016, the Company declared a non-recurring special cash distribution on the Company's common shares of limited liability interests of $9.25 per share, or $13,714,790 in the aggregate payable June 15, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 6, 2016. Nasdaq set the ex-dividend date as June 16, 2016.\nOn August 29, 2016, the Company declared another non-recurring special cash distribution on the Company's common shares of limited liability interests of $1.50 per share, or $2,224,020 in the aggregate, payable September 15, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 9, 2016.\nOn June 16, 2017, the Company declared another non-recurring special cash distribution on the Company's common shares of limited liability company interests of $1.00 per share, or $1,482,680 in the aggregate, payable July 7, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 27, 2017.\nFuture distribution/dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board and will depend on our actual cash flow, proceeds generated from opportunistic sales of properties, our financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as the Board deems relevant. The actual cash flow available to make distributions will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the factors discussed under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report.\nInterest Rates:\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve increased its benchmark interest rate multiple times in 2017. Furthermore, following the March 2018 Federal Reserve Meeting, the Federal Reserve announced another quarter point raise in the benchmark federal funds rate to a range between 1.5% and 1.75% and has continued signaling that rates could continue to rise. Increases in interest rates could decrease the amount potential purchasers are willing to pay for our properties. Expectations are for the rate increases to continue in the wake of ongoing economic growth and some acceleration in inflationary pressures, with the goal of the Federal Reserve to normalize the level of interest rates. Little in the U.S. macroeconomic data suggests that the economy is growing too rapidly, the primary symptom of trouble ahead for a business cycle. However, recent changes to tax policy, government spending and trade policy has created economic uncertainty as to whether these factors, in culmination, could adversely effect the current economic cycle. The uncertainty about continued economic recovery has also impacted, and may continue to impact, our tenants' businesses. For example, tenants may be reluctant to make long-term lease commitments. In the current economic climate, we continue to follow a disciplined approach to managing our operations. In certain cases, the Company has addressed these challenges through various tenant incentives which resulted in the Company's current market rents and related occupancy rates.\nHealthcare:\nOur tenants in our Cortlandt Manor and Port Jefferson properties are healthcare service providers. Furthermore, the Company is repositioning the industrial buildings, in the Flowerfield Industrial Park, to expand and support Stony Brook University and Stony Brook University Hospital. The healthcare industry is subject to substantial regulation and faces increased regulation particularly relating to fraud, waste and abuse, cost control and healthcare management. The healthcare industry may experience a significant expansion of applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations, previously enacted or future healthcare reform, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or changes in enforcement priorities, all of which could materially impact the business and operations of our tenants and therefore the marketability of our medical office properties.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the ACA\u201d) impacted the healthcare marketplace by decreasing the number of uninsured individuals in the United States through the establishment of health insurance exchanges to facilitate the purchase of health insurance, expanded Medicaid eligibility, subsidized insurance premiums and included requirements and incentives for businesses to provide healthcare benefits. The ACA remains subject to continuing and increasing legislative and administrative scrutiny, including current efforts by Congress and the current presidential administration to repeal, alter and replace the ACA in total or in part. In 2017, Congress unsuccessfully sought to replace substantial parts of the ACA with different mechanisms for facilitating insurance coverage in the commercial and Medicaid markets, but was able to enact legislation eliminating the tax penalty for individuals who do not purchase insurance. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) discontinued providing cost-sharing reduction subsidies to insurance providers, which is expected to have the result of increasing the cost of insurance premiums. Further, CMS has begun approving waivers permitting states to alter state Medicaid programs by, among other things, requiring individuals to meet certain requirements, such as work requirements, in order to maintain eligibility for Medicaid. These and other actions may impact the insurance markets and reduce the number of individuals purchasing insurance or qualifying for Medicaid and may negatively impact the operations and financial condition of our medical office tenants, which in turn may adversely impact us. Congress may revisit ACA or Medicaid reform legislation in 2018. If the ACA is repealed or further substantially modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the ACA are suspended, such actions could negatively impact the operations and financial condition of our medical office tenants, which in turn may adversely impact us.\nOur tenants are subject to extensive federal, state, and local licensure laws, regulations and industry standards governing business operations, the physical plant and structure, patient rights and privacy and security of health information. Our tenants' failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of licensure, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines or other penalties, suspension or exclusion from the government sponsored Medicare and Medicaid programs, loss of accreditation or certification, or closure of the facility. In addition, efforts by third-party payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private insurance carriers, including health maintenance organizations and other health plans, impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon healthcare provider operations (through changes in reimbursement rates and methodologies, discounted fee structures, the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk or otherwise). Our tenants may also face significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees, all of which could impact their ability to pay rent or other obligations to us.\nLimited Partnership Investment\nThe Company has a 10.12% limited partnership interest in Callery-Judge Grove, L.P. (the Grove\u201d). The Grove previously owned a 3,700+ acre citrus grove (the Grove Property\u201d) located in Palm Beach County, Florida as its only asset, which is the subject of a plan for mixed-use development. On September 19, 2013, the Grove Property was sold in a foreclosure proceeding to Minto Florida Developments, LLC ( Minto\u201d) pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement which provided that the Grove had the right to receive certain payments on the sale of single family residential units constructed on the property or on the sale of the property itself. During 2016, Gyrodyne was informed by the Grove's managing partner that Minto transferred the property to an affiliate which triggered an appraisal process that resulted in the payment (in lieu of being required to make payments on the sale of individual units or the property itself) by Minto to the Grove of $1,968,750. The Grove's managing partner also informed Gyrodyne that the payment along with some of its existing cash would be utilized to repay certain debt obligations owed to certain limited partners in the amount of $2.7 million. In light of the foregoing, Gyrodyne believes that the Grove will most likely not receive any additional payments from Minto beyond the aforementioned $1,968,750. Inasmuch as the Grove's obligations to certain limited partners exceeded the payment it received from Minto, it is unlikely that Gyrodyne could expect to receive any final liquidating distribution from the Grove.\nProperty Value Enhancement\nThe Company is pursuing entitlements/zoning to maximize the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $1.7 million of land entitlement/re-zoning costs, of which approximately $353,000 was for the purchase, inclusive of closing costs, of a residential 0.3-acre lot adjacent to the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center. The balance was mainly attributable to preparing the respective applications for entitlements inclusive of certain costs related to addressing SEQRA. The preparation of the application is the first statutory step with each respective town, of our strategic plan to maximize the value to our shareholders with a low amount of risk. Although there can be no assurances, we anticipate that the acquired land will enhance the achievable density and sale value of the Cortlandt property. We estimate that the Company may incur approximately $2.5 million in additional land entitlement/re-zoning costs through 2019 in pursuit of special permits and or zone changes (approximately $0.6 million in Cortlandt Manor and $1.9 in Flowerfield).\nThe Company is focusing its resources on positioning the properties to be sold with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction values in the shortest period of time with the least amount of risk to the Company. During the process of pursuing such entitlements, the Company may entertain offers from potential buyers who may be willing to pay prices for the properties that the Company finds more attractive from a timing or value perspective than completing the entitlement process. While the real estate market is dynamic, the economy is uncertain and there can be no assurances, we anticipate that these expenditures will result in higher sale prices of the properties and larger liquidating distributions to our shareholders than could otherwise be achievable.\nCortlandt Manor. On March 15, 2016, the Town of Cortlandt Manor (the Town\u201d) adopted a 2016 Sustainable Comprehensive Plan (the Plan\u201d) of which one key strategy was the simultaneous creation of a Medical Oriented District ( MOD\u201d). The purpose of the MOD is to expand the Town's existing medical infrastructure and encourage economic development, including capital investment, job creation and housing options. The MOD allows for a continuum of care, i.e., independent living, assisted living and nursing/hospital care, within or in neighboring facilities by centralizing medical services and related activities. As a designated zoning district, the MOD could include hospital, ambulatory surgery, primary and urgent care, hospice, laboratories, social services, boutique hotels and a wide range of housing.\nThe Company's existing 33,871 square foot Cortlandt Medical Center and its approximate twelve acres are located directly opposite New York Presbyterian's Hudson Valley Hospital Center and within the boundaries of the MOD. The Company has committed resources toward both market research and feasibility studies in support of achieving entitlements to maximize the value of the property. For approximately two years the Company along with its planner and engineers have been working closely with the Town to identify issues and solutions involved in creating the Plan and more specifically, the MOD.\nOn April 20, 2017, the Company closed on the purchase of a 1,950-square foot single-family residential dwelling located on approximately 0.3 acres in Cortlandt Manor, New York. The purchase price, inclusive of closing costs, was approximately $353,000. The Company was able to take advantage of a distressed sale following foreclosure action by the lender. The property which adjoins the Cortlandt Medical Center and is across the street from New York Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital Center, is expected to become part of the Cortlandt Manor MOD. The property may provide additional vehicular access to the site from Buttonwood Drive and State Route 202 and additional parking which, although there can be no assurances, the Company believes will further increase the yield in a manner that is cost effective and should provide a significant return on investment to the shareholders.\nThe Company filed an application with the Town of Cortlandt Manor to develop the Cortlandt Manor property, on March 31, 2017, as follows:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> SUBDIVISION LOT #\n</td> <td> BUILDING SIZE/YIELD\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Medical office\n</td> <td> 100,000 sft\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Multi-family apartments\n</td> <td> 200 units\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Retail\n</td> <td> 4,000 sft\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has been working closely with Town officials on entitlement complexity, environmental impact studies, traffic mitigation, effluent, financial impact and other variables to ensure the application synchronizes with the Town's vision on the MOD. Furthermore, while we are pursuing the above entitlements, we are also seeking the approval of yield that can be transferred among the three proposed uses as market demand changes.\nThe entitlement/re-zoning costs from December 2013 through December 31, 2017 associated with the ownership and development of this property consisted of architectural and engineering costs, legal expenses, economic analysis, soil management, surveys and land acquisitions totaling $1,302,284.\nAs a property owner with eligible parcels in this proposed district, Gyrodyne submitted an Environmental Assessment Form to the Town of Cortlandt Planning Department in December 2017 to support its application to receive a MOD campus designation. Once designated, the parcels would be governed by the use, dimensional and other provisions of the MOD zoning regulations and MOD zoning would replace the existing zoning. While the MOD zoning has not been formally adopted, Gyrodyne is proposing medical office and residential use and has designed the site to function as part of a future \"hamlet center\u201d with mixed use, streetscape improvements, a hamlet green and public plaza, and significant open space around Orchard Lake.\nWe anticipate the Town of Cortlandt Manor Planning Department to host a public hearing (community outreach meeting) in June, 2018, at which the Company will present its development plan for the Cortlandt Manor property, and after which the Town Planning Board will formally issue a positive or negative ruling under SEQRA. The Company does not plan on developing the property but rather positioning the properties to be sold with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction value for the Company in the shortest period of time with the least amount of risk to the Company.\nFlowerfield. Following extensive market research and related feasibility studies, we identified the entitlements that we believe will maximize the value of Flowerfield in the shortest amount of time with the lowest amount of risk. The Company has been in discussions with the Town of Smithtown on the potential real estate development projects identified by the market research and feasibility studies, all of which currently fall within our as of right to build\u201d zoning. We are also exploring with the Town of Smithtown whether it would be amenable to certain entitlements, special permits, or other concessions that would allow for the identified development projects.\nIn March 2017, the Company filed a pre-subdivision application with the Town of Smithtown (the Pre-application\u201d) for the Flowerfield property along with the previously sold (2002) catering hall facility for an eight-lot subdivision. In June 2017, the Company filed a subdivision application with the Town of Smithtown based on feedback provided by the Town of Smithtown staff in the Pre-application process. Because of the property's location within 500 feet of a municipal boundary and a state road, the Town of Smithtown referred the Company's subdivision application to the Suffolk County Planning Commission as required by the Suffolk County Administrative Code and the New York State General Municipal Law.\nOn August 2, 2017, the Suffolk County Planning Commission voted 11-0 to approve Gyrodyne's subdivision application without conditions. Although the approval by the Suffolk County Planning Commission is not binding on the Town of Smithtown, the approval without conditions means that the requisite vote threshold at the Town of Smithtown's Planning Board is a simple majority; had the Suffolk County Planning Commission approved the subdivision application with conditions, a supermajority would have been required for the Town of Smithtown's Planning Board to approve the Company's subdivision application.\nOn November 15, 2017, the Town of Smithtown Planning Board hosted a public hearing where the Company presented its subdivision plan of the Flowerfield property. The Company awaits the Planning Board's Determination of Significance under SEQRA, which will either be a Negative Declaration (a determination that the project will not result in significant adverse environmental impacts), a Conditioned Negative Declaration (a determination that the project may have potentially significant adverse environmental impacts which can be eliminated or mitigated by conditions imposed by the Planning Board) or a Positive Declaration (the project may result in one or more significant environmental impacts and will require the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement). The former Town Planning Board Chairman communicated that a Positive Declaration will require up to one year to complete the SEQRA process. The Company has already submitted various studies to the Town of Smithtown Planning Department prior to the public hearing that it hopes will reduce the time frame to complete the SEQRA process in the event a Positive Declaration is issued. In addition, the Company believes the new Town Planning Board Chairman is more aligned with the newly elected current Town Supervisor's support of economic development which may serve to narrow the time to complete the SEQRA process. The Company does not plan on developing the property but rather positioning the properties to be sold with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction values in the shortest period of time with the least amount of risk to the Company.\nThe details of the Company's subdivision application are as follows:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> SUBDIVISION LOT #\n</td> <td> LOT SIZE\n(acres)\n</td> <td> LAND USE\n</td> <td> BUILDING SIZE/YIELD\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Existing Industrial Park - Mixed Use\n</td> <td> 132,719 sft\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Catering Hall (sold in 2002)\n</td> <td> 34,685sft\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Hotel with Restaurant,\nSpa/Fitness\nand Conference Center\n</td> <td> 150 Rooms plus 150 seat restaurant\n10,000 sft\n500 seats\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Medical Office /R&D Office building\n</td> <td> 53,400 sft\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Medical Office/R&D Office building\n</td> <td> 76,350 sft\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Assisted Living\n</td> <td> 104 units\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Assisted Living\n</td> <td> 116 units\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Common Area\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to common area within Lot 8, the plan envisions an open space network of trails, benches and passive recreation that will serve as a recreational amenity to tie together the uses within the overall Flowerfield campus landscape. The entitlement costs from December 2013 through December 31, 2017 associated with the ownership and development of this property consisted of architectural and engineering costs, legal expenses, economic analysis, soil management and surveys totaling $1,923.740. The Company has an additional 5.2 acres bordering the industrial park that are currently zoned residential and are not part of the subdivision application.\nWhile we cannot predict the outcome of the subdivision application, we have undertaken to subdivide the Flowerfield property in a manner that is economically advantageous to the Company.\nAs envisioned in the chart above, the subdivision application will seek to subdivide the Flowerfield property using a low-impact development campus approach that provides a complementary mix of land uses with a green space network throughout the subdivision. Opportunities for shared green space, roads, utilities and parking are incorporated into the plan and preserves the historic 200-foot setback from Route 25A. The Flowerfield campus would be a beautiful, environmentally sound and amenity enriched community that wouldn't overly burden existing infrastructure and the local community with the additional costs of the education of elementary and high school students. We believe the campus will generate a significant new real estate tax base for the Town of Smithtown and the Smithtown Central School District.\nThe Company's subdivision application is expected to include proposed uses for the subdivided lots, although the specific uses will be determined by the eventual purchasers. It is anticipated that the proposed uses described herein would be typical of those chosen by the future owners and as a result we requested that the subdivision be considered with those uses so that the purchasers of the lots would have an assigned density. Furthermore, while we are pursuing the above entitlements, we are also seeking the approval of yield that can be transferred between the proposed uses as market demand changes. The Company's subdivision application includes perfecting the subdivision of the catering facility (12 acres hereafter referred to as lot 2) which the Company sold in 2002.\nIn accordance with the draft Smithtown Comprehensive Plan Update, the new additions to the Flowerfield campus would be focused on uses supportive and beneficial to Stony Brook University (SBU), inclusive of Stony Brook University Hospital, namely, the development of a first class 150 bed hotel with conference facilities, restaurant and health club; medical office facilities; and assisted living facilities. Furthermore, the connection with SBU via the existing LIRR crossing, which we are actively negotiating the re-opening of, will help to foster synergies between Flowerfield and SBU.\nLot 1 encompasses the existing uses of the current light industrial park being retained thereby keeping in place jobs from the local business community, locations for back office operations of SBU, and studios for a vibrant arts community that yields cultural benefits to Smithtown and the surrounding communities.\nLot 2 owned by a catering facility that sits on a 12-acre lot that was sold in 2002. The subdivision was deferred by the town until the overall plan for Flowerfield was submitted.\nLot 3 is planned as a 150-room hotel that would include a 150-seat restaurant. The hotel could also have a 500-seat conference space and a 10,000-square foot day spa/fitness center. It is envisioned that this hotel would serve the adjacent catering facility, as well as the office uses on-site and the nearby SBU.\nLots 4 and 5 are envisioned as medical office, general office, or tech space (R&D) in support of SBU, its Hospital and Children's Hospital, and its Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology (CEWIT). The two lots could be developed separately or as one larger lot. Approximately 129,750 square feet of office space in two buildings (53,400 and 76,350 sf) would be provided.\nLots 6 and 7 are envisioned as assisted living communities, comprising a total of 220 units, again either as two separate lots or one combined lot. There would be a synergy with the SBU Hospital and with the medical office uses for medical care of the residents of the assisted living facilities.\nSummary. The Company is in the process of pursuing entitlements, density and/or rezoning, and our ability to obtain required permits and authorizations is subject to factors beyond our control, including environmental concerns of governmental entities and community groups. The process involves extensive analysis internally at the government entity level, as well as between government entities such as town planning departments and Gyrodyne, and will continue up until such time as entitlement, rezoning and density decisions are made by the relevant government entities. We hope to secure favorable decisions on entitlements, rezoning and density so that we can then seek the sale of our remaining properties at higher prices than otherwise obtainable and then proceed with the intended liquidation and dissolution of the Company. As referred to above, the Suffolk County Planning Commission voted on August 2, 2017 to approve the Company's subdivision application without conditions. Accordingly, the application will require approval of a simple majority, and not a supermajority, of the Town Board for the Company to be able to proceed with its subdivision plan. The Town is now obligated to comply with the provisions of SEQRA in connection with its review of the subdivision application. The time period for the Town of Smithtown to complete its review of the subdivision application will not begin to run until the SEQRA process has been completed. The Company cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty the length of time it will take for the Town of Smithtown to complete the SEQRA process. The Company expects the process of pursuing entitlements, rezoning and density could take up to an additional two years with the ultimate timing to a certain extent managed by Gyrodyne but ultimately dependent and under the control of the applicable municipality's planning board or other governmental authority. During this process, the subdivision plan could be amended depending on market forces.\nFlowerfield Industrial Park Value Enhancement Strategy. The Company's primary strategy is to pursue the entitlements. In addition, the Company is also implementing a secondary but parallel strategy of maximizing the value of the Flowerfield Industrial Park's current buildings through targeting certain uses which the Company also believes will help maximize the achievable density from the entitlements it is pursuing on the undeveloped property.\nThe Company's strategy to maximize the value of the Flowerfield Industrial Park includes repositioning the industrial buildings to service Stony Brook University, inclusive of Stony Brook University Hospital, while also making it a cultural destination (arts, health and wellness center) for the community. The Company believes this strategy will enhance the value of the entitlements (via a lower traffic impact than its historical use) while also increasing the cashflow and market value of the industrial buildings.\nOur business relationship with Stony Brook University is expanding. Effective October 24, 2017, the Company and the State of New York acting through Stony Brook University Hospital ( SBU Hospital\u201d) entered into an amendment to the existing lease with SBU Hospital (approved by the New York State Controller's Office on January 19, 2018) for the expansion of the existing space currently occupied by SBU Hospital from approximately 13,747 square feet at a rate of $24.76 per square foot to 26,573 square feet at rate of $19.00 (plus annual escalators) per square foot. The total lease commitment from the amendment net of the existing lease is approximately $3.5 million and extends through 2025. The lease amendment obligates the Company, at its sole cost and expense, to build out the additional 12,826 square feet (the Additional Space\u201d) and provide a \"turnkey\" facility in accordance with an agreed-upon work letter.\nTo finance the buildout of the additional space, the Company secured a non-revolving credit line with a bank for up to $3,000,000, which closed on March 21, 2018. There will be an interest only phase for the first eight months of the loan ( Interest-Only Phase\u201d) after which it will automatically convert to a permanent loan maturing on November 30, 2025 (84 months after conversion to a permanent loan) (the Permanent Phase\u201d). The interest rate during the Interest-Only Phase shall be a variable rate equal to the daily highest prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal plus 100 basis points (1% rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent). During the Permanent Phase, the Company will pay interest at a fixed rate based on the Federal Home Loan Bank rate for a 7 year maturity as made available by the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York plus a margin of 200 basis points (2%) rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent but in no event less than 4.25%, plus principal based on a 20-year amortization period.\nThe first advance of up to $1.1 million will be used to finance the tenant improvements pursuant to the expanded signed leasing relationship with SBU Hospital described above. The balance of the loan can be drawn upon for improvements to be completed by the Company, as landlord, pursuant to a lease with State University of New York or its affiliates (or other tenants subject to the bank's approval) anytime during the Interest-Only Phase.\nThe mortgage loan is secured by approximately 31.8 acres of the Flowerfield Industrial Park including the respective buildings and related leases. The only significant financial covenant associated with the loan is a debt service ratio on GSD Flowerfield, LLC of 1.35 to 1. The Company anticipates modifying the terms of the loan following the completion of its subdivision.\nThe Company is committed to focusing its current capital on supporting operations and the pursuit of entitlements. The loan is financing the Company's secondary but dual strategy of maximizing the value of the Flowerfield.", "item_7_truncated": "The details of the Company's subdivision application are as follows:\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> SUBDIVISION LOT #\n</td> <td> BUILDING SIZE/YIELD\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Medical office\n</td> <td> 100,000 sft\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Multi-family apartments\n</td> <td> 200 units\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Retail\n</td> <td> 4,000 sft\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur primary non-operating uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2017 were as follows:\nIncome taxes - The Company follows the guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This guidance, among other things, creates a two-step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. Recognition (step one) occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that more-likely-than-not will be realized upon settlement. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. This interpretation specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions, and it has expanded disclosure requirements. The Company believes it is more likely than not that its tax positions will be sustained in any tax examinations. The Company has no income tax expense, deferred tax assets or liabilities, associated with any such uncertain tax positions. The Company's open tax years are 2014, 2015, and 2016.\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> December 31, 2017 cash and cash equivalents balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income offset by net cash used to settle current working capital acct and security deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.00 </td> <td>) </td> <td> (i)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Free cash flow from rental operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.07 </td> <td>) </td> <td> (ii)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses including final liquidation and dissolution\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.55 </td> <td>) </td> <td> (iii)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Land entitlement/re-zoning costs in pursuit of the highest and best use\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.52 </td> <td>) </td> <td> (iv)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross real estate proceeds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling costs on real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.98 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retention bonus plan for directors, officers and employees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.64 </td> <td>) </td> <td> (v)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.43 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directors and officers insurance ( D&O\u201d) - tail policy\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.45 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.01 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Assets in Liquidation\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.64 </td> <td> </td> <td> (vi)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company is committed to focusing its current capital on supporting operations and the pursuit of entitlements.

If our common shares were delisted from Nasdaq voluntarily or involuntarily, trading of our common shares most likely will be conducted in the over-the-counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as OTCQX, OTCBX or OTC Pink which will reduce the market liquidity of our common shares. Delisting may result in lower levels of ownership and trading by institutional shareholders, who are generally guided by quantitative and qualitative investment standards such as market capitalization, minimum share price and liquidity, which in turn often produces lower trading volumes and reduced liquidity. As a result, an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common shares. Also, many brokers will not allow customers to hold non-listed securities in managed accounts or place restrictions which inhibit holding or trading, and it is generally understood that brokers will not recommend non-listed securities to retail clients, perhaps not as official policy but rather as a practical reality.

While the real estate market is dynamic, the economy is uncertain and there can be no assurances, we anticipate that these expenditures will result in higher sale prices of the properties and larger liquidating distributions to our shareholders than could otherwise be achievable.\nCortlandt Manor. On March 15, 2016, the Town of Cortlandt Manor (the Town\u201d) adopted a 2016 Sustainable Comprehensive Plan (the Plan\u201d) of which one key strategy was the simultaneous creation of a Medical Oriented District ( MOD\u201d). The purpose of the MOD is to expand the Town's existing medical infrastructure and encourage economic development, including capital investment, job creation and housing options. The MOD allows for a continuum of care, i.e., independent living, assisted living and nursing/hospital care, within or in neighboring facilities by centralizing medical services and related activities. As a designated zoning district, the MOD could include hospital, ambulatory surgery, primary and urgent care, hospice, laboratories, social services, boutique hotels and a wide range of housing.\nDiscussion of Changes in Net Assets\nThe Company may offer tenant concessions in the form of rent abatements rather than tenant improvements to maximize its working capital position. However, tenant improvement incentives may be offered in certain cases where concessions are not effective in meeting the demands of the existing or prospective tenant.\nOn November 15, 2017, the Town of Smithtown Planning Board hosted a public hearing where the Company presented its subdivision plan of the Flowerfield property. The Company awaits the Planning Board's Determination of Significance under SEQRA, which will either be a Negative Declaration (a determination that the project will not result in significant adverse environmental impacts), a Conditioned Negative Declaration (a determination that the project may have potentially significant adverse environmental impacts which can be eliminated or mitigated by conditions imposed by the Planning Board) or a Positive Declaration (the project may result in one or more significant environmental impacts and will require the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement). The former Town Planning Board Chairman communicated that a Positive Declaration will require up to one year to complete the SEQRA process. The Company has already submitted various studies to the Town of Smithtown Planning Department prior to the public hearing that it hopes will reduce the time frame to complete the SEQRA process in the event a Positive Declaration is issued. In addition, the Company believes the new Town Planning Board Chairman is more aligned with the newly elected current Town Supervisor's support of economic development which may serve to narrow the time to complete the SEQRA process. The Company does not plan on developing the property but rather positioning the properties to be sold with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction values in the shortest period of time with the least amount of risk to the Company.\n\nThe Company's primary sources of funds which are limited and expected to narrow as we liquidate properties and make distributions are as follows:\n (iii) The General and Administrative expenses are estimated to be $4.55. The costs represent all costs to liquidate the company excluding rental operating costs and non-operating costs (D&O tail and severance). \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn May 4th, 2016, the Company sold the Fairfax Medical Center for $14,015,000.\n (vi) The net assets in liquidation at December 31, 2017 would result in liquidating distributions of approximately $17.97 per common share ($26.6 million with 1,482,680 shares outstanding), excluding any additional sales proceeds, that may result directly or indirectly from the remaining $2.5 million in land entitlement/re-zoning costs. The Company believes the land entitlement/re-zoning costs will enhance estimated distributions per share through the improved values from the sales of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties. This estimate of liquidating distributions includes projections of costs and expenses to be incurred during the period required to complete the liquidation process. There is inherent uncertainty with these projections, and they could change materially based on the timing of the sales, favorable or unfavorable changes in the land entitlement/re-zoning costs, the performance of the underlying assets and any changes in the underlying assumptions of the projected cash flows. \nSince the commencement of our liquidation process, the Company has completed the sale of ten properties for gross aggregate proceeds of over $21.8 million. Although we have not released or disclosed the appraised values of our individual real estate holdings so as not to put the Company in a negotiating disadvantage, the gross proceeds achieved in each such sale have been in excess of the appraised value of the respective property.\nSummary. The Company is in the process of pursuing entitlements, density and/or rezoning, and our ability to obtain required permits and authorizations is subject to factors beyond our control, including environmental concerns of governmental entities and community groups. The process involves extensive analysis internally at the government entity level, as well as between government entities such as town planning departments and Gyrodyne, and will continue up until such time as entitlement, rezoning and density decisions are made by the relevant government entities. We hope to secure favorable decisions on entitlements, rezoning and density so that we can then seek the sale of our remaining properties at higher prices than otherwise obtainable and then proceed with the intended liquidation and dissolution of the Company. As referred to above, the Suffolk County Planning Commission voted on August 2, 2017 to approve the Company's subdivision application without conditions. Accordingly, the application will require approval of a simple majority, and not a supermajority, of the Town Board for the Company to be able to proceed with its subdivision plan. The Town is now obligated to comply with the provisions of SEQRA in connection with its review of the subdivision application. The time period for the Town of Smithtown to complete its review of the subdivision application will not begin to run until the SEQRA process has been completed. The Company cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty the length of time it will take for the Town of Smithtown to complete the SEQRA process. The Company expects the process of pursuing entitlements, rezoning and density could take up to an additional two years with the ultimate timing to a certain extent managed by Gyrodyne but ultimately dependent and under the control of the applicable municipality's planning board or other governmental authority. During this process, the subdivision plan could be amended depending on market forces.\n 1. Adjustments for the estimated cash receipts from the operation of the properties net of rental property related expenditures as well as costs expected to be incurred to preserve or improve the net realizable value of the property at its estimated gross sales proceeds. \nThe success of our leasing strategy will be dependent upon the general economic conditions and more specifically real estate market conditions and trends in the United States and in our target markets of Suffolk and Westchester Counties in New York. We cannot give any assurance that leases will be renewed or that available space will be re-leased at rental rates equal to or above the current contractual rental rates.\n \u25cf $13,300,833 in net proceeds from the sale of the Fairfax Medical Center; \nIn accordance with the draft Smithtown Comprehensive Plan Update, the new additions to the Flowerfield campus would be focused on uses supportive and beneficial to Stony Brook University (SBU), inclusive of Stony Brook University Hospital, namely, the development of a first class 150 bed hotel with conference facilities, restaurant and health club; medical office facilities; and assisted living facilities. Furthermore, the connection with SBU via the existing LIRR crossing, which we are actively negotiating the re-opening of, will help to foster synergies between Flowerfield and SBU.\nOur primary non-operating uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2016 were as follows:\nOur leasing strategy for 2018 includes focusing on leasing vacant space, negotiating early renewals for leases scheduled to expire through 2018 and identifying new tenants or existing tenants seeking additional space. A core part of our leasing strategy is to expand our leasing relationship with New York Presbyterian Hudson Valley Medical Center and Stony Brook University which border the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center and the Flowerfield Industrial Park, respectively. We believe expanding the leasing relationships with these institutions will enhance the post entitlement values of the respective properties as well as the current value of the developed portion of the Flowerfield Industrial Park.\n \u25cf $981,254 of costs incurred in the pursuit of entitlements for Flowerfield; and \n \u25cf $565,584 of capital expenditures on the real estate portfolio excluding those costs incurred under the land entitlement/re-zoning effort. \nThe Company is pursuing various avenues to maximize total distributions to our shareholders during the liquidation process. The Company estimates that it will incur approximately $2.5 million (included in the statements of net assets as part of the estimated liquidation and operating costs net of receipts) in land entitlement/re-zoning costs over the two years ended December 31, 2019, inclusively, in an effort to obtain entitlements, inclusive of zone changes and special permits. The Company believes the commitment of these resources will enable the Company to position the properties for sale with all entitlements necessary to maximize the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor property values. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred approximately $1.7 million of land entitlement/re-zoning costs, of which approximately $353,000 was for the purchase of a single-family residence on a 0.3-acre lot of adjacent land to the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center, inclusive of closing costs. The Company believes the remaining balance of $2.5 million will be incurred from January 2018 through the end of liquidation. The Company does not intend to develop the properties but rather to commit resources to position the properties for sale in a timely manner with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction values. The costs and time frame to achieve the entitlements could change due to a range of factors including a shift in the value of certain entitlements making it more profitable to pursue a different mix of zones/entitlements and the dynamics of the real estate market. As a result, the Company has focused and will continue to focus its land entitlement/re-zoning efforts on achieving the highest and best use. During the process of pursuing such entitlements, the Company may entertain offers from potential buyers who may be willing to pay premiums for the properties that the Company finds more acceptable from a timing or value perspective than completing the entitlement processes itself. The value of the real estate reported in the Statements of Net Assets as of December 31, 2017 (predicated on current asset values) does not include any potential value impact that may result from the estimated $2.5 million in land entitlement/re-zoning costs. There can be no assurance that our value enhancement efforts will result in property value increases that exceed the costs we incur in such efforts, or even any increase at all.\nDiscussion of the Statement of Net Assets\nGyrodyne is pursuing the opportunistic disposition of certain properties and the enhancement of the value of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties, by pursuing various zoning/entitlement opportunities, which the Gyrodyne Board believes will improve the chances of obtaining better values for such properties. Gyrodyne intends to dissolve after it completes the disposition of all of its real property assets, applies the proceeds of such dispositions first to settle any debts and claims, pending or otherwise, against Gyrodyne, and then makes liquidating distributions to holders of Gyrodyne common shares. Therefore, effective September 1, 2015 Gyrodyne adopted the liquidation basis of accounting. This basis of accounting is considered appropriate when, among other things, liquidation of the entity is imminent, as defined in ASC 205-30, Presentation of Financial Statements Liquidation Basis of Accounting. Under the LLC Agreement, the Board may elect, in its sole discretion and without any separate approval by shareholders, to dissolve the Company at any time the value of the Company's assets, as determined by the Board in good faith, is less than $1 million. The LLC Agreement also provides that the Company will dissolve, and its affairs wound up upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of all the real properties of the Company. As a result, liquidation is imminent\u201d in accordance with the guidance provided in ASC 205-30.\nFollowing the sales indicated above, the Company has one remaining building (comprising approximately 3,500 square feet in total) within the same medical park which is being actively marketed for sale.\n \u25cf $444,557 of costs incurred in the pursuit of entitlements for Flowerfield; and \n(a) The re-measurement of the assets and liabilities in liquidation during 2016 of $1,707,731 is mainly driven by the increased land entitlement/re-zoning costs and general and administrative expense required for the pursuit of the highest value in Cortlandt Manor and Flowerfield, offset by income from operations on the remaining properties and the change in retention bonus payments. The change in 2017 of $4,809,165 is mainly driven by the increased land entitlement/re-zoning costs and general and administrative expense required for the pursuit of the highest value in Cortlandt Manor and Flowerfield, offset by income from operations on the remaining properties and the change in retention bonus payments. Furthermore, the Company changed the timeline necessary to complete the research and related rezoning/entitlement efforts from the end of the 2018 to 2019. While the Company has and expects to continue to substantially reduce the rental expenses as assets are sold, the loss in the free cash flow from these properties to fund its operations and land entitlement/re-zoning efforts through 2019, the revised estimated date of dissolution has resulted in the majority of the remaining $4.79 million change in liabilities in excess of receipts.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts - Rent receivable is carried at net realizable value. Management makes estimates of the collectability of rents receivable. Management specifically analyzes receivables and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nLease Expirations\nThe following table summarizes the estimates to arrive at the Net Assets in Liquidation as of December 31, 2017 (dollars are in millions).\nOn April 20, 2017, the Company closed on the purchase of a 1,950-square foot single-family residential dwelling located on approximately 0.3 acres in Cortlandt Manor, New York. The purchase price, inclusive of closing costs, was approximately $353,000. The Company was able to take advantage of a distressed sale following foreclosure action by the lender. The property which adjoins the Cortlandt Medical Center and is across the street from New York Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital Center, is expected to become part of the Cortlandt Manor MOD. The property may provide additional vehicular access to the site from Buttonwood Drive and State Route 202 and additional parking which the Company believes will further increase the yield in a manner that is cost effective and should provide a significant return on investment to the shareholders.\nDispositions:\nOur business relationship with Stony Brook University is expanding. Effective October 24, 2017, the Company and the State of New York acting through Stony Brook University Hospital ( SBU Hospital\u201d) entered into an amendment to the existing lease with SBU Hospital (approved by the New York State Controller's Office on January 19, 2018) for the expansion of the existing space currently occupied by SBU Hospital from approximately 13,747 square feet at a rate of $24.76 per square foot to 26,573 square feet at rate of $19.00 (plus annual escalators) per square foot. The total lease commitment from the amendment net of the existing lease is approximately $3.5 million and extends through 2025. The lease amendment obligates the Company, at its sole cost and expense, to build out the additional 12,826 square feet (the Additional Space\u201d) and provide a \"turnkey\" facility in accordance with an agreed-upon work letter.\nLot 3 is planned as a 150-room hotel that would include a 150-seat restaurant. The hotel could also have a 500-seat conference space and a 10,000-square foot day spa/fitness center. It is envisioned that this hotel would serve the adjacent catering facility, as well as the office uses on-site and the nearby SBU.\nFair Value Measurements - The Company believes the concepts for determining net realizable value are consistent with the guidance for measuring fair value. As a result, the Company follows the guidance of FASB Accounting Standards Codification, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures to determine the fair value of financial and non-financial instruments. The guidance defines fair value, establishes a hierarchy framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures related to the fair value. The guidance establishes a hierarchy breaking down observable and unobservable inputs into three levels: Level 1 - observable inputs in an active market on or around the measurement date, Level 2 - observable inputs that are based on prices not quoted on active markets but corroborated by market data and Level 3 - unobservable inputs utilized when no other data is available.\nLimited Partnership Investment\n (iv) The Company is considering various options to maximize total distributions to our shareholders during the liquidation process. The Company estimates that it will incur approximately $2.52 million in costs over the two years ending December 31, 2019 to obtain entitlements, inclusive of zone changes and special permits that it believes will result in maximizing the values in the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties. The Company does not intend to develop the properties but rather to commit resources to position the properties for sale in a timely manner with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction values. During the process of pursuing such entitlements, the Company may entertain offers from potential buyers who may be willing to pay premiums for the properties that the Company finds more acceptable from a timing or value perspective than completing the entitlement processes. \n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the ACA\u201d) impacted the healthcare marketplace by decreasing the number of uninsured individuals in the United States through the establishment of health insurance exchanges to facilitate the purchase of health insurance, expanded Medicaid eligibility, subsidized insurance premiums and included requirements and incentives for businesses to provide healthcare benefits. The ACA remains subject to continuing and increasing legislative and administrative scrutiny, including current efforts by Congress and the current presidential administration to repeal, alter and replace the ACA in total or in part. In 2017, Congress unsuccessfully sought to replace substantial parts of the ACA with different mechanisms for facilitating insurance coverage in the commercial and Medicaid markets, but was able to enact legislation eliminating the tax penalty for individuals who do not purchase insurance. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) discontinued providing cost-sharing reduction subsidies to insurance providers, which is expected to have the result of increasing the cost of insurance premiums. Further, CMS has begun approving waivers permitting states to alter state Medicaid programs by, among other things, requiring individuals to meet certain requirements, such as work requirements, in order to maintain eligibility for Medicaid. These and other actions may impact the insurance markets and reduce the number of individuals purchasing insurance or qualifying for Medicaid and may negatively impact the operations and financial condition of our medical office tenants, which in turn may adversely impact us. Congress may revisit ACA or Medicaid reform legislation in 2018. If the ACA is repealed or further substantially modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the ACA are suspended, such actions could negatively impact the operations and financial condition of our medical office tenants, which in turn may adversely impact us.\n \u25cf $15,938,810 for payment of liquidating distributions to our common shareholders; \n \u25cf $3,981,842 in net proceeds from the sale of 5 of our buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park; and \n 6. Estimated amounts based on the net realizable value of the real estate under the Retention Bonus Plan. \nAs we pursue our plan to sell our properties opportunistically, including certain enhancement efforts, we believe that a main focus of management is to effectively manage our net assets through cash flow management of our tenant leases, maintaining or improving occupancy, and enhance the value of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties via the pursuit of the associated change in zone/entitlements.\nUnder the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement (the \"Settlement\") relating to the class action litigation against the Company, Gyrodyne agreed that any sales of its properties would be effected only in arm's-length transactions at prices at or above their December 2014 appraised values. The 2014 appraised value for the properties in the aggregate was approximately $100,000 higher than the 2013 aggregate appraised value for such properties used to value the interests of GSD, then a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation into which all of the Corporation's properties were transferred, and whose shares were distributed to the Corporation's shareholders. As of December 31, 2017, the appraised value in the aggregate of the remaining unsold properties was $4,416,665 higher than the 2014 appraised values. See, Risk Factors -- Stipulation of Settlement prohibits us from selling our remaining properties at prices below the December 2014 appraised values\u201d.\nWe generally finance our operations and acquisitions through cash on hand. However, we entered into a credit facility on March 21, 2018 that will provide up to $3.0 million in financing for tenant improvements pursuant to certain leases with Stony Brook University. The balance of the loan can only be drawn upon to finance tenant improvements if required in the event, the Company signs additional leases or lease expansions with Stony Brook University or its affiliates (or other improvements subject to the bank's approval) anytime during the Interest-Only Phase. We believe leveraging our tenant improvements will allow us to continue focusing our cash on funding the pursuit of entitlements and our operations. The Company believes the combination of the investments in tenant improvements related to strategically important leases and the pursuit of entitlements will enable the Company to maximize the ultimate real estate value and the distributions per share.\nThe Company is pursuing entitlements/zoning to maximize the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $1.7 million of land entitlement/re-zoning costs, of which approximately $353,000 was for the purchase, inclusive of closing costs, of a residential 0.3-acre lot adjacent to the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center. The balance was mainly attributable to preparing the respective applications for entitlements inclusive of certain costs related to addressing SEQRA. The preparation of the application is the first statutory step with each respective town, of our strategic plan to maximize the value to our shareholders with a low amount of risk. Although there can be no assurances, we anticipate that the acquired land will enhance the achievable density and sale value of the Cortlandt property. We estimate that the Company may incur approximately $2.5 million in additional land entitlement/re-zoning costs through 2019 in pursuit of special permits and or zone changes (approximately $0.6 million in Cortlandt Manor and $1.9 in Flowerfield).\nThe cash balance at the end of the liquidation period (currently estimated to be December 31, 2019, although the estimated completion of the liquidation period may change), excluding any interim distributions, is estimated based on the December 31, 2017 cash balance of $5.3 million plus adjustments for the following items which are estimated through December 31, 2019:\nCautionary Statements Concerning Forward-Looking Statements. The statements made in this Form 10-K, other materials the Company has filed or may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in each case that are not historical facts, contain forward-looking information\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended, which can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may,\u201d will,\u201d anticipates,\u201d expects,\u201d projects,\u201d estimates,\u201d believes,\u201d seeks,\u201d could,\u201d should,\u201d or continue,\u201d the negative thereof, and other variations or comparable terminology as well as statements regarding the evaluation of strategic alternatives and liquidation contingencies. These forward-looking statements are based on the current plans and expectations of management and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to our efforts to enhance the values of our remaining major properties and seek the orderly, opportunistic sale and liquidation of such properties as soon as reasonably practicable, the effect of economic and business conditions, risks inherent in the real estate markets of Suffolk and Westchester Counties in New York, the ability to obtain additional capital in order to enhance the value of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties, risks and uncertainties associated with any litigation that may develop in connection with our efforts to sell our properties opportunistically, including related enhancement efforts, and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports. These and other matters the Company discusses in this Report, or in the documents it incorporates by reference into this Report, may cause actual results to differ from those the Company describes. The Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company closed on the sale of three and five buildings (approximately 4,000 square feet each), respectively, in the Port Jefferson Professional Park as follows:\nOur tenants are subject to extensive federal, state, and local licensure laws, regulations and industry standards governing business operations, the physical plant and structure, patient rights and privacy and security of health information. Our tenants' failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of licensure, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines or other penalties, suspension or exclusion from the government sponsored Medicare and Medicaid programs, loss of accreditation or certification, or closure of the facility. In addition, efforts by third-party payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private insurance carriers, including health maintenance organizations and other health plans, impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon healthcare provider operations (through changes in reimbursement rates and methodologies, discounted fee structures, the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk or otherwise). Our tenants may also face significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees, all of which could impact their ability to pay rent or other obligations to us.\nThe Company's primary non-operating cashflows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are as follows:\nOur operating focus is on maximizing cashflows and market value of our operating properties while we are securing entitlements and zoning modifications with the objective of enhancing the value of our remaining major properties and maximizing liquidating distributions to our shareholders as soon as reasonably practicable. As of December 31, 2017, our properties were 69% leased to 42 tenants. As of December 31, 2016, on a pro forma basis to exclude assets sold through December 31, 2017, our properties were 77% leased to 48 tenants. The year over year decrease in the gross portfolio occupancy percentage is primarily the result of tenants terminated at Flowerfield to reposition the industrial park with an expanded leasing relationship with Stony Brook University. The expanded relationship is synergistic with the potential value associated with the entitlements being pursued on the undeveloped land. The Company believes the two-pronged strategy of pursuing entitlements while expanding the relationship with Stony Brook University will support our strategic goal of maximizing the estimated liquidating distributions via maximizing the real estate value of our remaining portfolio. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the Company has almost doubled the space we are leasing relationship to Stony Brook University which is a contributing factor to the increase in value of the real estate reported in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets.\n\nOur primary sources of non-operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the following:\nLot 2 owned by a catering facility that sits on a 12-acre lot that was sold in 2002. The subdivision was deferred by the town until the overall plan for Flowerfield was submitted.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve increased its benchmark interest rate multiple times in 2017. Furthermore, following the March 2018 Federal Reserve Meeting, the Federal Reserve announced another quarter point raise in the benchmark federal funds rate to a range between 1.5% and 1.75% and has continued signaling that rates could continue to rise. Increases in interest rates could decrease the amount potential purchasers are willing to pay for our properties. Expectations are for the rate increases to continue in the wake of ongoing economic growth and some acceleration in inflationary pressures, with the goal of the Federal Reserve to normalize the level of interest rates. Little in the U.S. macroeconomic data suggests that the economy is growing too rapidly, the primary symptom of trouble ahead for a business cycle. However, recent changes to tax policy, government spending and trade policy has created economic uncertainty as to whether these factors, in culmination, could adversely effect the current economic cycle. The uncertainty about continued economic recovery has also impacted, and may continue to impact, our tenants' businesses. For example, tenants may be reluctant to make long-term lease commitments. In the current economic climate, we continue to follow a disciplined approach to managing our operations. In certain cases, the Company has addressed these challenges through various tenant incentives which resulted in the Company's current market rents and related occupancy rates.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\nTo finance the buildout of the additional space, the Company secured a non-revolving credit line with a bank for up to $3,000,000, which closed on March 21, 2018. There will be an interest only phase for the first eight months of the loan ( Interest-Only Phase\u201d) after which it will automatically convert to a permanent loan maturing on November 30, 2025 (84 months after conversion to a permanent loan) (the Permanent Phase\u201d). The interest rate during the Interest-Only Phase shall be a variable rate equal to the daily highest prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal plus 100 basis points (1% rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent). During the Permanent Phase, the Company will pay interest at a fixed rate based on the Federal Home Loan Bank rate for a 7 year maturity as made available by the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York plus a margin of 200 basis points (2%) rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent but in no event less than 4.25%, plus principal based on a 20-year amortization period.\nFactors Which May Influence Future Operations\nIn addition to common area within Lot 8, the plan envisions an open space network of trails, benches and passive recreation that will serve as a recreational amenity to tie together the uses within the overall Flowerfield campus landscape. The entitlement costs from December 2013 through December 31, 2017 associated with the ownership and development of this property consisted of architectural and engineering costs, legal expenses, economic analysis, soil management and surveys totaling $1,923.740. The Company has an additional 5.2 acres bordering the industrial park that are currently zoned residential and are not part of the subdivision application.\nThe Company's subdivision application is expected to include proposed uses for the subdivided lots, although the specific uses will be determined by the eventual purchasers. It is anticipated that the proposed uses described herein would be typical of those chosen by the future owners and as a result we requested that the subdivision be considered with those uses so that the purchasers of the lots would have an assigned density. Furthermore, while we are pursuing the above entitlements, we are also seeking the approval of yield that can be transferred between the proposed uses as market demand changes. The Company's subdivision application includes perfecting the subdivision of the catering facility (12 acres hereafter referred to as lot 2) which the Company sold in 2002.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $5.3 million. The Company anticipates that its current cash and cash equivalent balance will be adequate to fund its liquidation process and dissolution over the next twelve months. The $5.3 million of cash will be partially used to fund our efforts to generate the highest values for the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties while simultaneously pursuing the opportunistic sale of these properties. The pursuit to generate the highest values of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor may involve the acquisition of properties, pursuit of joint venture relationships, entitlements and/or zoning changes and other investments and or other strategies to maximize the returns for our shareholders. The Company is estimating and reporting in the Statement of Net Assets total gross cash proceeds from the sale of its assets of approximately $33.0 million. Based on the Company's current cash balance and the above forecast, the Company estimates distributable cash stemming from the liquidation of the Company of approximately $26.6 million.\nWhile we cannot predict the outcome of the subdivision application, we have undertaken to subdivide the Flowerfield property in a manner that is economically advantageous to the Company.\nManagement Estimates - In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d) and the liquidation basis of accounting, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, including net assets in liquidation, and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of receipts and expenditures for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe anticipate the Town of Cortlandt Manor Planning Department to host a public hearing (community outreach meeting) in June, 2018, at which the Company will present its development plan for the Cortlandt Manor property, and after which the Town Planning Board will formally issue a positive or negative ruling under SEQRA. The Company does not plan on developing the property but rather positioning the properties to be sold with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction value for the Company in the shortest period of time with the least amount of risk to the Company.\nLots 6 and 7 are envisioned as assisted living communities, comprising a total of 220 units, again either as two separate lots or one combined lot. There would be a synergy with the SBU Hospital and with the medical office uses for medical care of the residents of the assisted living facilities.\nOn May 26, 2016, the Company declared a non-recurring special cash distribution on the Company's common shares of limited liability interests of $9.25 per share, or $13,714,790 in the aggregate payable June 15, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 6, 2016. Nasdaq set the ex-dividend date as June 16, 2016.\nAcquisitions:\nOur primary sources of non-operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of the following:\nThe net assets in liquidation at December 31, 2017 ($26,637,350) results in estimated liquidating distributions of approximately $17.97 per common share (based on 1,482,680 shares outstanding), based on estimates and other indications of sales value but excluding any actual additional sales proceeds that may result directly or indirectly from our land entitlement/re-zoning efforts. Neither the additional value that may be derived from the land entitlement/re-zoning costs, nor the retention bonuses for the sale of the Flowerfield property are included in the estimated liquidating distributions as of December 31, 2017. The Company believes the land entitlement/re-zoning costs will enhance estimated distributions per share through the improved values from the sales of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties. This estimate of liquidating distributions includes projections of costs and expenses to be incurred during the period required to complete the plan of liquidation. There is inherent uncertainty with these projections, and they could change materially based on the timing of the sales, improved values of the Cortlandt Manor and/or Flowerfield properties resulting from the land entitlement/re-zoning efforts net of any bonuses if such values exceed the minimum values required to pay bonuses under the retention bonus plan, favorable or unfavorable changes in the land entitlement/re-zoning costs, the performance of the underlying assets, the market for commercial real estate properties generally and any changes in the underlying assumptions of the projected cash flows.\nThe Company's assumptions and estimates (including the sales proceeds of all its real estate holdings, selling costs, retention bonus payments, rental revenues, rental expenses, capital expenditures, land entitlement/re-zoning costs, general and administrative fees, director and officer liability and reimbursement, post liquidation insurance tail coverage policy and final liquidation costs) are based on completing the liquidation by the end of 2019. As previously stated, on an ongoing basis, Gyrodyne evaluates the estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the reported net assets in liquidation and will update accordingly for any costs and value associated with a change in the duration of the liquidation, as we cannot give any assurance on the timing of the ultimate sale of all the Company's properties.\n 2. Proceeds from the sale of all the Company's real estate holdings. \n (ii) The Company estimates the cash outflows from rental operations net of commissions and rental costs, inclusive of expenditures to preserve or improve the properties at its current estimated market value and rental income, will total $(0.07). \nBasis of Presentation - Liquidation Basis of Accounting - Under the liquidation basis of accounting the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of operations, statement of equity, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the consolidated statement of cash flows are no longer presented. The consolidated statement of net assets in liquidation and the consolidated statement of changes in net assets are the principal financial statements presented under the liquidation basis of accounting.\nProperty Value Enhancement\nOur tenants in our Cortlandt Manor and Port Jefferson properties are healthcare service providers. Furthermore, the Company is repositioning the industrial buildings, in the Flowerfield Industrial Park, to expand and support Stony Brook University and Stony Brook University Hospital. The healthcare industry is subject to substantial regulation and faces increased regulation particularly relating to fraud, waste and abuse, cost control and healthcare management. The healthcare industry may experience a significant expansion of applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations, previously enacted or future healthcare reform, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or changes in enforcement priorities, all of which could materially impact the business and operations of our tenants and therefore the marketability of our medical office properties.\n \u25cf $2,590,645 in net proceeds from the sale of 3 of our buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park \nThe Company is making tenant improvements at Flowerfield to convert certain existing industrial space into office space to meet our expanding relationship with Stony Brook University, which the Company believes will enhance the value of the property as a whole by improving the building space and drawing a high quality long-term tenant. It would also increase the synergy with the University and allow for a portion of the trip generation from this office space to be accommodated using the internal access point between the properties. The Company believes that the planned tenant improvements for leases signed in the first quarter of 2018 will cost approximately $1 million and that we are financing the cost of such tenant improvements with a credit facility, rather than using our cash on hand. To finance the tenant improvements, we secured a non-revolving credit line with a bank for up to $3 million, with the first advance of up to $1.1 million to be used to finance the foregoing tenant improvements with Stony Brook Hospital. The balance of the credit line would be available for improvements under a lease with Stony Brook University or its affiliates or other tenant spaces with bank approval. There can be no assurance that the Flowerfield property will increase in value as a result of the tenant improvements or that any resulting increase in value of the Flowerfield property will exceed the cost of our planned tenant improvements including the cost of the related financing.\nDuring 2017, the Company incurred approximately $34,000 in leasing fees and commissions in exchange for revenue commitments of approximately $555,000 with leases ranging from 2 years to 5 years. The leasing fees reflect a renewal cost rate of 6.1% of the related revenue commitments. The Company often renews leases without external brokers or other third-party costs which during 2017 resulted in an additional $937,000 in lease commitments. As a result, the total lease commitments signed during 2017 was approximately $1.5 million. The Company has approximately 27% of its annual leasing revenue up for renewal in 2017, which compares unfavorably to 24% of leases up for renewal in 2016. General economic conditions, coupled with rental markets in which we operate, will dictate how rental rates on new leases and renewals will compare, favorably or unfavorably, to those leases that were signed in 2017.\nUnder the liquidation basis of accounting, all the Company's assets have been stated at their estimated net realizable value, or liquidation value, (which represents the estimated amount of cash that Gyrodyne will collect on the disposal of assets as it carries out the plan of liquidation), which is based on current contracts, estimates and other indications of sales value (predicated on current values). All liabilities of the Company, including those estimated costs associated with implementing the plan of liquidation, have been stated at their estimated settlement amounts. These amounts are presented in the accompanying statements of net assets. These estimates are periodically reviewed and adjusted as appropriate. There can be no assurance that these estimated values will be realized. Such amounts should not be taken as an indication of the timing or amount of future distributions or our actual dissolution. The valuation of assets at their net realizable value and liabilities at their anticipated settlement amount represent estimates, based on present facts and circumstances, of the net realizable value of the assets and the costs associated with carrying out the plan of liquidation. The actual values and costs associated with carrying out the plan of liquidation may differ from amounts reflected in the accompanying financial statements because of the plan's inherent uncertainty. These differences may be material. In particular, the estimates of our costs will vary with the length of time necessary to complete the plan of liquidation, which is currently anticipated to be completed by the end of 2019. The Company is in the process of pursuing entitlements, density and/or rezoning, and our ability to obtain required permits and authorizations is subject to factors beyond our control, including environmental concerns of governmental entities and community groups. The process will involve extensive analysis internally at the government entity level, as well as between government entities such as town planning departments and Gyrodyne, and will continue up until such time as entitlement, rezoning and density decisions are made by the relevant government entities. We hope to secure favorable decisions on entitlements, rezoning and density so that we can then seek the sale of our remaining properties at higher prices (than those achievable under their current entitlements) and then proceed with the liquidation and dissolution of the Company. The Company expects the process of pursuing entitlements, rezoning and density could take up to two years with the ultimate timing to a certain extent managed by Gyrodyne but ultimately dependent and under the control of the applicable municipality's planning board or other governmental authority. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict with certainty the timing or aggregate amount which may ultimately be distributed to common shareholders and no assurance can be given that the distributions will equal or exceed the estimate presented in the accompanying Statement of Net Assets.\n \u25cf $426,658 of capital expenditures on the real estate portfolio excluding those costs incurred under the land entitlement/re-zoning effort. \nThe Company filed an application with the Town of Cortlandt Manor to develop the Cortlandt Manor property, on March 31, 2017, as follows:\nThe Company estimates the net realizable value of its real estate assets by using income and market valuation techniques. The Company may estimate net realizable values using market information such as broker opinions of value, appraisals, and recent sales data for similar assets or discounted cash flow models, which primarily rely on Level 3 inputs. The cash flow models include estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period. These cash flows may include contractual rental revenues, projected future rental revenues and expenses and forecasted tenant improvements and lease commissions based upon market conditions determined through discussion with local real estate professionals, experience the Company has with its other owned properties in such markets and expectations for growth. Capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are estimated by management based upon rates that management believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective properties based upon an analysis of factors such as property and tenant quality, geographical location and local supply and demand observations. To the extent the Company under estimates forecasted cash outflows (tenant improvements, lease commissions and operating costs) or over estimates forecasted cash inflows (rental revenue rates), the estimated net realizable value of its real estate assets could be overstated.\nThe continued economic challenges for small businesses, including the lack of available credit to many of our tenant classes who are small businesses and the uncertainty facing medical tenants brought about by the 2010 Federal health care reform legislation, recent changes impacting such legislation and the current legislative environment could adversely affect our operating results and accordingly the estimated cash proceeds from the liquidation process.\n \u25cf $452,517 of costs incurred in the pursuit of entitlements for Cortlandt Manor inclusive of the land purchase; \n 3. The net cash used to settle the working capital accounts. \n \u25cf $736,867 of costs incurred in the pursuit of entitlements for Cortlandt Manor inclusive of the land purchase; \nThe Company's existing 33,871 square foot Cortlandt Medical Center and its approximate twelve acres are located directly opposite New York Presbyterian's Hudson Valley Hospital Center and within the boundaries of the MOD. The Company has committed resources toward both market research and feasibility studies in support of achieving entitlements to maximize the value of the property. For approximately two years the Company along with its planner and engineers have been working closely with the Town to identify issues and solutions involved in creating the Plan and more specifically, the MOD.\nThe mortgage loan is secured by approximately 31.8 acres of the Flowerfield Industrial Park including the respective buildings and related leases. The only significant financial covenant associated with the loan is a debt service ratio on GSD Flowerfield, LLC of 1.35 to 1. The Company anticipates modifying the terms of the loan following the completion of its subdivision.\n (v) The gross real estate proceeds do not include any value impact that may result from the estimated land entitlement/re-zoning efforts. As a result, fair value as reported does not exceed the minimum value under the retention bonus plan (the appraisal of the real estate in late 2013 plus the estimated entitlement costs) on certain properties and accordingly the Company has not included any estimated bonuses on the sale of the Flowerfield property. However, if the Company concludes in future periodic filings that the value of the real estate to the extent actual net proceeds from the ultimate disposition of the properties exceed the value of the real estate reported in the Statement of Net Assets as of December 31, 2017, and such net proceeds exceeds the minimum value required to pay bonuses under the retention bonus plan (whether due to appreciation of the underlying real estate and/or a reduction in estimated land entitlement/re-zoning costs), then the Company will report the updated estimated real estate value and the estimated bonuses related to such value of the Flowerfield property in accordance with the provisions of the retention bonus plan. \nTax legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017, makes numerous changes to the tax rules. For example, the top federal income tax rate for individuals is reduced to 37%, there is a new deduction available for certain Qualified Business Income, that reduces the top effective tax rate applicable to ordinary dividends from REITs to 29.6% (through a 20% deduction for ordinary REIT dividends received) and various deductions are eliminated or limited. Most of the changes applicable to individuals are temporary. There are only minor changes to the REIT rules (other than the 20% deduction applicable to individuals for ordinary REIT dividends received). To date, the Internal Revenue Service has issued only limited guidance on the changes made by the new legislation. It is unclear at this time whether Congress will address these issues or when the Internal Revenue Service will issue additional administrative guidance on the changes made by the new legislation.\nLot 1 encompasses the existing uses of the current light industrial park being retained thereby keeping in place jobs from the local business community, locations for back office operations of SBU, and studios for a vibrant arts community that yields cultural benefits to Smithtown and the surrounding communities.\nPort Jefferson Professional Park.\nOn June 16, 2017, the Company declared another non-recurring special cash distribution on the Company's common shares of limited liability company interests of $1.00 per share, or $1,482,680 in the aggregate, payable July 7, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 27, 2017.\n 5. Costs for the pursuit of the entitlement/rezoning of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties, to maximize value \nInterest Rates:\n 4. The general and administrative expenses and or liabilities associated with operations and the liquidation of the Company including severance, director and officer liability inclusive of post liquidation tail policy coverage, and financial and legal fees to complete the liquidation. \nAs a property owner with eligible parcels in this proposed district, Gyrodyne submitted an Environmental Assessment Form to the Town of Cortlandt Planning Department in December 2017 to support its application to receive a MOD campus designation. Once designated, the parcels would be governed by the use, dimensional and other provisions of the MOD zoning regulations and MOD zoning would replace the existing zoning. While the MOD zoning has not been formally adopted, Gyrodyne is proposing medical office and residential use and has designed the site to function as part of a future \"hamlet center\u201d with mixed use, streetscape improvements, a hamlet green and public plaza, and significant open space around Orchard Lake.\n \u25cf credit facility earmarked for tenant improvements. \nPrinciples of consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Gyrodyne and all subsidiaries. All consolidated subsidiaries are wholly-owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n \u25cf $881,066 in principal repayments on the investment in mortgage backed securities. \nNew accounting pronouncements - Management has evaluated the impact of newly issued accounting pronouncements, whether effective or not as of December 31, 2017, and has concluded that they will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements since the Company reports on a liquidation basis.\nCash Flows:\nAs used herein, the terms we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or the Company\u201d refer to Gyrodyne LLC, the succeeding company of the merger of Gyrodyne Company of America, Inc. and Gyrodyne Special Distribution, LLC with and into the Company. We operate as a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate company (prior to the Merger, a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d)) focused on pursuing entitlements/re-zoning, owning, leasing and managing medical, commercial and industrial real estate. Our tenants include unrelated diversified entities with a recent emphasis on medical office parks and properties. Our properties are located in Suffolk and Westchester counties in New York, which are characterized by strong real estate markets.\nThe following is a summary of lease expirations and related revenues of leases in place at December 31, 2017. This table assumes that none of the tenants exercise renewal options or early termination rights, if any, at or prior to the scheduled expirations:\nThe Company is pursuing value associated with the highest and best use for Flowerfield and the Cortlandt Medical Center. The actual costs of achieving such values may differ materially from the assumptions and estimates utilized and accordingly, could have a significant impact on the value of net assets.\n (i) The Company estimates interest income will be offset by the settlement of its working capital accounts resulting in a balance of $(1.00). \n\nExcluding gross proceeds from the sale of assets, the Company's gross rents and tenant reimbursements net of rental expenses is less than the combined total annual general and administrative costs, capital expenditures and land entitlement/re-zoning costs creating a net use of cash on an annual basis through the liquidation process. The Company believes the cash and cash equivalents plus the proceeds from the sale of assets and funds available through its credit facility will exceed the costs to complete the liquidation of the Company. In addition, the Company has and will continue to review operating activities for possible cost reductions throughout the liquidation process.\nWe actively manage the renewal process in conjunction with a third-party asset management firm. Historically, this has resulted in a very low turnover rate with our tenants. As a result, the Company continues to actively manage lease termination dates and often approaches tenants up to one year in advance to gauge renewal interest and negotiate related leases. Where a termination is likely, the Company begins marketing the property prior to termination to timely identify the market rent for the specific space, expected vacancy period and market demanded tenant concessions and incentives. During 2017, the Company provided approximately $72,700 in incentives in the form of tenant improvements and lease concessions in the form of rent abatement of approximately $25,000. The aforementioned incentives resulted in total lease commitments of approximately $570,000.\nAs the Company executes on the sale of assets, it will no less than annually, review its capital needs and declare and distribute any excess cash, accordingly. Upon completion of these activities, if successful, Gyrodyne will distribute the remaining cash to its shareholders and then proceed to complete the dissolution of the Company, delist its shares from Nasdaq or other exchange platform and terminate its registration and reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as Amended (the Exchange Act\u201d). Gyrodyne is required to make adequate provisions to satisfy its known and unknown liabilities which could substantially delay or limit its ability to make future distributions to shareholders. The process of accounting for liabilities, including those that are currently unknown or whose amounts are uncertain may involve difficult valuation decisions which could adversely impact the amount or timing of any future distributions.\nFairfax Medical Center.\nIn March 2016, the Company acquired a four-acre undeveloped lot, in Cortlandt Manor, for $210,000, including related costs which the company believes is synergistic to maximizing the value on its property.\nHealthcare:\nOn April 20, 2017, the Company closed on the purchase of a 1,950-square foot single-family residential dwelling located on approximately 0.3 acres in Cortlandt Manor, New York. The purchase price, inclusive of closing costs, was approximately $353,000. The Company was able to take advantage of a distressed sale following foreclosure action by the lender. The property which adjoins the Cortlandt Medical Center and is across the street from New York Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital Center, is expected to become part of the Cortlandt Manor MOD. The property may provide additional vehicular access to the site from Buttonwood Drive and State Route 202 and additional parking which, although there can be no assurances, the Company believes will further increase the yield in a manner that is cost effective and should provide a significant return on investment to the shareholders.\nGyrodyne's strategy is to enhance the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor, by pursuing various zoning or entitlement opportunities, which the Gyrodyne Board believes will improve the chances of obtaining better values for such properties. The pursuit of the highest and best use of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor may involve the acquisition of properties, pursuit of joint venture relationships and other investments and or other strategies to maximize the returns for our shareholders. Gyrodyne intends to dissolve after it completes the disposition of all of its real property assets, applies the proceeds of such dispositions first to settle any debts and claims, pending or otherwise, against Gyrodyne, and then makes liquidating distributions to holders of Gyrodyne common shares. Therefore, the Company includes in its financial statements the Statement of Changes in Net Assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, all of which is discussed below:\nFlowerfield Industrial Park Value Enhancement Strategy. The Company's primary strategy is to pursue the entitlements. In addition, the Company is also implementing a secondary but parallel strategy of maximizing the value of the Flowerfield Industrial Park's current buildings through targeting certain uses which the Company also believes will help maximize the achievable density from the entitlements it is pursuing on the undeveloped property.\nIn March 2017, the Company filed a pre-subdivision application with the Town of Smithtown (the Pre-application\u201d) for the Flowerfield property along with the previously sold (2002) catering hall facility for an eight-lot subdivision. In June 2017, the Company filed a subdivision application with the Town of Smithtown based on feedback provided by the Town of Smithtown staff in the Pre-application process. Because of the property's location within 500 feet of a municipal boundary and a state road, the Town of Smithtown referred the Company's subdivision application to the Suffolk County Planning Commission as required by the Suffolk County Administrative Code and the New York State General Municipal Law.\nLots 4 and 5 are envisioned as medical office, general office, or tech space (R&D) in support of SBU, its Hospital and Children's Hospital, and its Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology (CEWIT). The two lots could be developed separately or as one larger lot. Approximately 129,750 square feet of office space in two buildings (53,400 and 76,350 sf) would be provided.\n 7. Proceeds from the draw downs on the debt facility to fund tenant improvements and costs to repay such outstanding debt. \nFlowerfield. Following extensive market research and related feasibility studies, we identified the entitlements that we believe will maximize the value of Flowerfield in the shortest amount of time with the lowest amount of risk. The Company has been in discussions with the Town of Smithtown on the potential real estate development projects identified by the market research and feasibility studies, all of which currently fall within our as of right to build\u201d zoning. We are also exploring with the Town of Smithtown whether it would be amenable to certain entitlements, special permits, or other concessions that would allow for the identified development projects.\nSpecial Distributions:\nThe first advance of up to $1.1 million will be used to finance the tenant improvements pursuant to the expanded signed leasing relationship with SBU Hospital described above. The balance of the loan can be drawn upon for improvements to be completed by the Company, as landlord, pursuant to a lease with State University of New York or its affiliates (or other tenants subject to the bank's approval) anytime during the Interest-Only Phase.\nFuture distribution/dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board and will depend on our actual cash flow, proceeds generated from opportunistic sales of properties, our financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as the Board deems relevant. The actual cash flow available to make distributions will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the factors discussed under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report.\nOn August 29, 2016, the Company declared another non-recurring special cash distribution on the Company's common shares of limited liability interests of $1.50 per share, or $2,224,020 in the aggregate, payable September 15, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 9, 2016.\nThe Company has a 10.12% limited partnership interest in Callery-Judge Grove, L.P. (the Grove\u201d). The Grove previously owned a 3,700+ acre citrus grove (the Grove Property\u201d) located in Palm Beach County, Florida as its only asset, which is the subject of a plan for mixed-use development. On September 19, 2013, the Grove Property was sold in a foreclosure proceeding to Minto Florida Developments, LLC ( Minto\u201d) pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement which provided that the Grove had the right to receive certain payments on the sale of single family residential units constructed on the property or on the sale of the property itself. During 2016, Gyrodyne was informed by the Grove's managing partner that Minto transferred the property to an affiliate which triggered an appraisal process that resulted in the payment (in lieu of being required to make payments on the sale of individual units or the property itself) by Minto to the Grove of $1,968,750. The Grove's managing partner also informed Gyrodyne that the payment along with some of its existing cash would be utilized to repay certain debt obligations owed to certain limited partners in the amount of $2.7 million. In light of the foregoing, Gyrodyne believes that the Grove will most likely not receive any additional payments from Minto beyond the aforementioned $1,968,750. Inasmuch as the Grove's obligations to certain limited partners exceeded the payment it received from Minto, it is unlikely that Gyrodyne could expect to receive any final liquidating distribution from the Grove.\nNet assets in liquidation at December 31, 2017 would result in estimated liquidating distributions of approximately $17.97 per common share. This increase of $0.01 from the December 31, 2016 net assets in liquidation of $17.96 per common share, net of the $1.00 per share special distribution paid in July 2017, is the result of increased property valuations offset by the tenant improvements required for a lease expansion with an existing tenant in the industrial park.\nThe Company's strategy to maximize the value of the Flowerfield Industrial Park includes repositioning the industrial buildings to service Stony Brook University, inclusive of Stony Brook University Hospital, while also making it a cultural destination (arts, health and wellness center) for the community. The Company believes this strategy will enhance the value of the entitlements (via a lower traffic impact than its historical use) while also increasing the cashflow and market value of the industrial buildings.\nThe Company has been working closely with Town officials on entitlement complexity, environmental impact studies, traffic mitigation, effluent, financial impact and other variables to ensure the application synchronizes with the Town's vision on the MOD. Furthermore, while we are pursuing the above entitlements, we are also seeking the approval of yield that can be transferred among the three proposed uses as market demand changes.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n \u25cf rents and tenant reimbursements received on our remaining real estate operating assets; \nCash equivalents - The Company considers all certificates of deposits, money market funds, treasury securities and other highly liquid debt instruments purchased with short-term maturities to be cash equivalents.\nOverview\n \u25cf $1,482,680 for payment of liquidating distributions to our common shareholders; \nOn August 2, 2017, the Suffolk County Planning Commission voted 11-0 to approve Gyrodyne's subdivision application without conditions. Although the approval by the Suffolk County Planning Commission is not binding on the Town of Smithtown, the approval without conditions means that the requisite vote threshold at the Town of Smithtown's Planning Board is a simple majority; had the Suffolk County Planning Commission approved the subdivision application with conditions, a supermajority would have been required for the Town of Smithtown's Planning Board to approve the Company's subdivision application.", "item_7_text": "The details of the Company's subdivision application are as follows:\nOur primary non-operating uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2017 were as follows:\nIncome taxes - The Company follows the guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This guidance, among other things, creates a two-step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. Recognition (step one) occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that more-likely-than-not will be realized upon settlement. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. This interpretation specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions, and it has expanded disclosure requirements. The Company believes it is more likely than not that its tax positions will be sustained in any tax examinations. The Company has no income tax expense, deferred tax assets or liabilities, associated with any such uncertain tax positions. The Company's open tax years are 2014, 2015, and 2016.\nThe Company is committed to focusing its current capital on supporting operations and the pursuit of entitlements. The loan is financing the Company's secondary but dual strategy of maximizing the value of the Flowerfield.\nEven if we are successful in maintaining compliance with applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, our board of directors may decide that the costs of compliance and the demands of management time and Company resources required to maintain our Nasdaq listing are greater than the benefits received by the Company and its shareholders from being a listed company and that, accordingly, consistent with other cash management and cost reduction measures that we have implemented, we should voluntarily delist from the Nasdaq Capital Market. If our common shares were delisted from Nasdaq voluntarily or involuntarily, trading of our common shares most likely will be conducted in the over-the-counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as OTCQX, OTCBX or OTC Pink which will reduce the market liquidity of our common shares. Delisting may result in lower levels of ownership and trading by institutional shareholders, who are generally guided by quantitative and qualitative investment standards such as market capitalization, minimum share price and liquidity, which in turn often produces lower trading volumes and reduced liquidity. As a result, an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common shares. Also, many brokers will not allow customers to hold non-listed securities in managed accounts or place restrictions which inhibit holding or trading, and it is generally understood that brokers will not recommend non-listed securities to retail clients, perhaps not as official policy but rather as a practical reality. We cannot assure you that our common shares, if delisted from Nasdaq voluntarily, or if they would be delisted involuntarily by Nasdaq, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the counter quotation system.\n\nAs envisioned in the chart above, the subdivision application will seek to subdivide the Flowerfield property using a low-impact development campus approach that provides a complementary mix of land uses with a green space network throughout the subdivision. Opportunities for shared green space, roads, utilities and parking are incorporated into the plan and preserves the historic 200-foot setback from Route 25A. The Flowerfield campus would be a beautiful, environmentally sound and amenity enriched community that wouldn't overly burden existing infrastructure and the local community with the additional costs of the education of elementary and high school students. We believe the campus will generate a significant new real estate tax base for the Town of Smithtown and the Smithtown Central School District.\nThe most significant estimates are the estimates on the net realizable value from the sale of our real estate, the estimated costs/time to pursue entitlements/change of zone and the related timeline to complete the liquidation.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the consolidated portfolio consisted of three developed properties, consisting of 11 buildings with an aggregate of 167,620 rentable square feet. The Company also owns undeveloped land parcels adjacent to existing properties for which alternative entitlement and zoning plans are currently being considered in order to enhance the value of the relevant primary property.\n \u25cf current cash and cash equivalents; \n \u25cf sale of assets; and \nThe entitlement/re-zoning costs from December 2013 through December 31, 2017 associated with the ownership and development of this property consisted of architectural and engineering costs, legal expenses, economic analysis, soil management, surveys and land acquisitions totaling $1,302,284.\nThe Company is focusing its resources on positioning the properties to be sold with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction values in the shortest period of time with the least amount of risk to the Company. During the process of pursuing such entitlements, the Company may entertain offers from potential buyers who may be willing to pay prices for the properties that the Company finds more attractive from a timing or value perspective than completing the entitlement process. While the real estate market is dynamic, the economy is uncertain and there can be no assurances, we anticipate that these expenditures will result in higher sale prices of the properties and larger liquidating distributions to our shareholders than could otherwise be achievable.\nCortlandt Manor. On March 15, 2016, the Town of Cortlandt Manor (the Town\u201d) adopted a 2016 Sustainable Comprehensive Plan (the Plan\u201d) of which one key strategy was the simultaneous creation of a Medical Oriented District ( MOD\u201d). The purpose of the MOD is to expand the Town's existing medical infrastructure and encourage economic development, including capital investment, job creation and housing options. The MOD allows for a continuum of care, i.e., independent living, assisted living and nursing/hospital care, within or in neighboring facilities by centralizing medical services and related activities. As a designated zoning district, the MOD could include hospital, ambulatory surgery, primary and urgent care, hospice, laboratories, social services, boutique hotels and a wide range of housing.\nDiscussion of Changes in Net Assets\nThe Company may offer tenant concessions in the form of rent abatements rather than tenant improvements to maximize its working capital position. However, tenant improvement incentives may be offered in certain cases where concessions are not effective in meeting the demands of the existing or prospective tenant.\nOn November 15, 2017, the Town of Smithtown Planning Board hosted a public hearing where the Company presented its subdivision plan of the Flowerfield property. The Company awaits the Planning Board's Determination of Significance under SEQRA, which will either be a Negative Declaration (a determination that the project will not result in significant adverse environmental impacts), a Conditioned Negative Declaration (a determination that the project may have potentially significant adverse environmental impacts which can be eliminated or mitigated by conditions imposed by the Planning Board) or a Positive Declaration (the project may result in one or more significant environmental impacts and will require the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement). The former Town Planning Board Chairman communicated that a Positive Declaration will require up to one year to complete the SEQRA process. The Company has already submitted various studies to the Town of Smithtown Planning Department prior to the public hearing that it hopes will reduce the time frame to complete the SEQRA process in the event a Positive Declaration is issued. In addition, the Company believes the new Town Planning Board Chairman is more aligned with the newly elected current Town Supervisor's support of economic development which may serve to narrow the time to complete the SEQRA process. The Company does not plan on developing the property but rather positioning the properties to be sold with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction values in the shortest period of time with the least amount of risk to the Company.\n\nThe Company's primary sources of funds which are limited and expected to narrow as we liquidate properties and make distributions are as follows:\n (iii) The General and Administrative expenses are estimated to be $4.55. The costs represent all costs to liquidate the company excluding rental operating costs and non-operating costs (D&O tail and severance). \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn May 4th, 2016, the Company sold the Fairfax Medical Center for $14,015,000.\n (vi) The net assets in liquidation at December 31, 2017 would result in liquidating distributions of approximately $17.97 per common share ($26.6 million with 1,482,680 shares outstanding), excluding any additional sales proceeds, that may result directly or indirectly from the remaining $2.5 million in land entitlement/re-zoning costs. The Company believes the land entitlement/re-zoning costs will enhance estimated distributions per share through the improved values from the sales of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties. This estimate of liquidating distributions includes projections of costs and expenses to be incurred during the period required to complete the liquidation process. There is inherent uncertainty with these projections, and they could change materially based on the timing of the sales, favorable or unfavorable changes in the land entitlement/re-zoning costs, the performance of the underlying assets and any changes in the underlying assumptions of the projected cash flows. \nSince the commencement of our liquidation process, the Company has completed the sale of ten properties for gross aggregate proceeds of over $21.8 million. Although we have not released or disclosed the appraised values of our individual real estate holdings so as not to put the Company in a negotiating disadvantage, the gross proceeds achieved in each such sale have been in excess of the appraised value of the respective property.\nSummary. The Company is in the process of pursuing entitlements, density and/or rezoning, and our ability to obtain required permits and authorizations is subject to factors beyond our control, including environmental concerns of governmental entities and community groups. The process involves extensive analysis internally at the government entity level, as well as between government entities such as town planning departments and Gyrodyne, and will continue up until such time as entitlement, rezoning and density decisions are made by the relevant government entities. We hope to secure favorable decisions on entitlements, rezoning and density so that we can then seek the sale of our remaining properties at higher prices than otherwise obtainable and then proceed with the intended liquidation and dissolution of the Company. As referred to above, the Suffolk County Planning Commission voted on August 2, 2017 to approve the Company's subdivision application without conditions. Accordingly, the application will require approval of a simple majority, and not a supermajority, of the Town Board for the Company to be able to proceed with its subdivision plan. The Town is now obligated to comply with the provisions of SEQRA in connection with its review of the subdivision application. The time period for the Town of Smithtown to complete its review of the subdivision application will not begin to run until the SEQRA process has been completed. The Company cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty the length of time it will take for the Town of Smithtown to complete the SEQRA process. The Company expects the process of pursuing entitlements, rezoning and density could take up to an additional two years with the ultimate timing to a certain extent managed by Gyrodyne but ultimately dependent and under the control of the applicable municipality's planning board or other governmental authority. During this process, the subdivision plan could be amended depending on market forces.\n 1. Adjustments for the estimated cash receipts from the operation of the properties net of rental property related expenditures as well as costs expected to be incurred to preserve or improve the net realizable value of the property at its estimated gross sales proceeds. \nThe success of our leasing strategy will be dependent upon the general economic conditions and more specifically real estate market conditions and trends in the United States and in our target markets of Suffolk and Westchester Counties in New York. We cannot give any assurance that leases will be renewed or that available space will be re-leased at rental rates equal to or above the current contractual rental rates.\n \u25cf $13,300,833 in net proceeds from the sale of the Fairfax Medical Center; \nIn accordance with the draft Smithtown Comprehensive Plan Update, the new additions to the Flowerfield campus would be focused on uses supportive and beneficial to Stony Brook University (SBU), inclusive of Stony Brook University Hospital, namely, the development of a first class 150 bed hotel with conference facilities, restaurant and health club; medical office facilities; and assisted living facilities. Furthermore, the connection with SBU via the existing LIRR crossing, which we are actively negotiating the re-opening of, will help to foster synergies between Flowerfield and SBU.\nOur primary non-operating uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2016 were as follows:\nOur leasing strategy for 2018 includes focusing on leasing vacant space, negotiating early renewals for leases scheduled to expire through 2018 and identifying new tenants or existing tenants seeking additional space. A core part of our leasing strategy is to expand our leasing relationship with New York Presbyterian Hudson Valley Medical Center and Stony Brook University which border the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center and the Flowerfield Industrial Park, respectively. We believe expanding the leasing relationships with these institutions will enhance the post entitlement values of the respective properties as well as the current value of the developed portion of the Flowerfield Industrial Park.\n \u25cf $981,254 of costs incurred in the pursuit of entitlements for Flowerfield; and \n \u25cf $565,584 of capital expenditures on the real estate portfolio excluding those costs incurred under the land entitlement/re-zoning effort. \nThe Company is pursuing various avenues to maximize total distributions to our shareholders during the liquidation process. The Company estimates that it will incur approximately $2.5 million (included in the statements of net assets as part of the estimated liquidation and operating costs net of receipts) in land entitlement/re-zoning costs over the two years ended December 31, 2019, inclusively, in an effort to obtain entitlements, inclusive of zone changes and special permits. The Company believes the commitment of these resources will enable the Company to position the properties for sale with all entitlements necessary to maximize the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor property values. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred approximately $1.7 million of land entitlement/re-zoning costs, of which approximately $353,000 was for the purchase of a single-family residence on a 0.3-acre lot of adjacent land to the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center, inclusive of closing costs. The Company believes the remaining balance of $2.5 million will be incurred from January 2018 through the end of liquidation. The Company does not intend to develop the properties but rather to commit resources to position the properties for sale in a timely manner with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction values. The costs and time frame to achieve the entitlements could change due to a range of factors including a shift in the value of certain entitlements making it more profitable to pursue a different mix of zones/entitlements and the dynamics of the real estate market. As a result, the Company has focused and will continue to focus its land entitlement/re-zoning efforts on achieving the highest and best use. During the process of pursuing such entitlements, the Company may entertain offers from potential buyers who may be willing to pay premiums for the properties that the Company finds more acceptable from a timing or value perspective than completing the entitlement processes itself. The value of the real estate reported in the Statements of Net Assets as of December 31, 2017 (predicated on current asset values) does not include any potential value impact that may result from the estimated $2.5 million in land entitlement/re-zoning costs. There can be no assurance that our value enhancement efforts will result in property value increases that exceed the costs we incur in such efforts, or even any increase at all.\nDiscussion of the Statement of Net Assets\nGyrodyne is pursuing the opportunistic disposition of certain properties and the enhancement of the value of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties, by pursuing various zoning/entitlement opportunities, which the Gyrodyne Board believes will improve the chances of obtaining better values for such properties. Gyrodyne intends to dissolve after it completes the disposition of all of its real property assets, applies the proceeds of such dispositions first to settle any debts and claims, pending or otherwise, against Gyrodyne, and then makes liquidating distributions to holders of Gyrodyne common shares. Therefore, effective September 1, 2015 Gyrodyne adopted the liquidation basis of accounting. This basis of accounting is considered appropriate when, among other things, liquidation of the entity is imminent, as defined in ASC 205-30, Presentation of Financial Statements Liquidation Basis of Accounting. Under the LLC Agreement, the Board may elect, in its sole discretion and without any separate approval by shareholders, to dissolve the Company at any time the value of the Company's assets, as determined by the Board in good faith, is less than $1 million. The LLC Agreement also provides that the Company will dissolve, and its affairs wound up upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of all the real properties of the Company. As a result, liquidation is imminent\u201d in accordance with the guidance provided in ASC 205-30.\nFollowing the sales indicated above, the Company has one remaining building (comprising approximately 3,500 square feet in total) within the same medical park which is being actively marketed for sale.\n \u25cf $444,557 of costs incurred in the pursuit of entitlements for Flowerfield; and \n(a) The re-measurement of the assets and liabilities in liquidation during 2016 of $1,707,731 is mainly driven by the increased land entitlement/re-zoning costs and general and administrative expense required for the pursuit of the highest value in Cortlandt Manor and Flowerfield, offset by income from operations on the remaining properties and the change in retention bonus payments. The change in 2017 of $4,809,165 is mainly driven by the increased land entitlement/re-zoning costs and general and administrative expense required for the pursuit of the highest value in Cortlandt Manor and Flowerfield, offset by income from operations on the remaining properties and the change in retention bonus payments. Furthermore, the Company changed the timeline necessary to complete the research and related rezoning/entitlement efforts from the end of the 2018 to 2019. While the Company has and expects to continue to substantially reduce the rental expenses as assets are sold, the loss in the free cash flow from these properties to fund its operations and land entitlement/re-zoning efforts through 2019, the revised estimated date of dissolution has resulted in the majority of the remaining $4.79 million change in liabilities in excess of receipts.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts - Rent receivable is carried at net realizable value. Management makes estimates of the collectability of rents receivable. Management specifically analyzes receivables and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nLease Expirations\nThe following table summarizes the estimates to arrive at the Net Assets in Liquidation as of December 31, 2017 (dollars are in millions).\nOn April 20, 2017, the Company closed on the purchase of a 1,950-square foot single-family residential dwelling located on approximately 0.3 acres in Cortlandt Manor, New York. The purchase price, inclusive of closing costs, was approximately $353,000. The Company was able to take advantage of a distressed sale following foreclosure action by the lender. The property which adjoins the Cortlandt Medical Center and is across the street from New York Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital Center, is expected to become part of the Cortlandt Manor MOD. The property may provide additional vehicular access to the site from Buttonwood Drive and State Route 202 and additional parking which the Company believes will further increase the yield in a manner that is cost effective and should provide a significant return on investment to the shareholders.\nDispositions:\nOur business relationship with Stony Brook University is expanding. Effective October 24, 2017, the Company and the State of New York acting through Stony Brook University Hospital ( SBU Hospital\u201d) entered into an amendment to the existing lease with SBU Hospital (approved by the New York State Controller's Office on January 19, 2018) for the expansion of the existing space currently occupied by SBU Hospital from approximately 13,747 square feet at a rate of $24.76 per square foot to 26,573 square feet at rate of $19.00 (plus annual escalators) per square foot. The total lease commitment from the amendment net of the existing lease is approximately $3.5 million and extends through 2025. The lease amendment obligates the Company, at its sole cost and expense, to build out the additional 12,826 square feet (the Additional Space\u201d) and provide a \"turnkey\" facility in accordance with an agreed-upon work letter.\nLot 3 is planned as a 150-room hotel that would include a 150-seat restaurant. The hotel could also have a 500-seat conference space and a 10,000-square foot day spa/fitness center. It is envisioned that this hotel would serve the adjacent catering facility, as well as the office uses on-site and the nearby SBU.\nFair Value Measurements - The Company believes the concepts for determining net realizable value are consistent with the guidance for measuring fair value. As a result, the Company follows the guidance of FASB Accounting Standards Codification, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures to determine the fair value of financial and non-financial instruments. The guidance defines fair value, establishes a hierarchy framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures related to the fair value. The guidance establishes a hierarchy breaking down observable and unobservable inputs into three levels: Level 1 - observable inputs in an active market on or around the measurement date, Level 2 - observable inputs that are based on prices not quoted on active markets but corroborated by market data and Level 3 - unobservable inputs utilized when no other data is available.\nLimited Partnership Investment\n (iv) The Company is considering various options to maximize total distributions to our shareholders during the liquidation process. The Company estimates that it will incur approximately $2.52 million in costs over the two years ending December 31, 2019 to obtain entitlements, inclusive of zone changes and special permits that it believes will result in maximizing the values in the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties. The Company does not intend to develop the properties but rather to commit resources to position the properties for sale in a timely manner with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction values. During the process of pursuing such entitlements, the Company may entertain offers from potential buyers who may be willing to pay premiums for the properties that the Company finds more acceptable from a timing or value perspective than completing the entitlement processes. \n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the ACA\u201d) impacted the healthcare marketplace by decreasing the number of uninsured individuals in the United States through the establishment of health insurance exchanges to facilitate the purchase of health insurance, expanded Medicaid eligibility, subsidized insurance premiums and included requirements and incentives for businesses to provide healthcare benefits. The ACA remains subject to continuing and increasing legislative and administrative scrutiny, including current efforts by Congress and the current presidential administration to repeal, alter and replace the ACA in total or in part. In 2017, Congress unsuccessfully sought to replace substantial parts of the ACA with different mechanisms for facilitating insurance coverage in the commercial and Medicaid markets, but was able to enact legislation eliminating the tax penalty for individuals who do not purchase insurance. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS\u201d) discontinued providing cost-sharing reduction subsidies to insurance providers, which is expected to have the result of increasing the cost of insurance premiums. Further, CMS has begun approving waivers permitting states to alter state Medicaid programs by, among other things, requiring individuals to meet certain requirements, such as work requirements, in order to maintain eligibility for Medicaid. These and other actions may impact the insurance markets and reduce the number of individuals purchasing insurance or qualifying for Medicaid and may negatively impact the operations and financial condition of our medical office tenants, which in turn may adversely impact us. Congress may revisit ACA or Medicaid reform legislation in 2018. If the ACA is repealed or further substantially modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the ACA are suspended, such actions could negatively impact the operations and financial condition of our medical office tenants, which in turn may adversely impact us.\n \u25cf $15,938,810 for payment of liquidating distributions to our common shareholders; \n \u25cf $3,981,842 in net proceeds from the sale of 5 of our buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park; and \n 6. Estimated amounts based on the net realizable value of the real estate under the Retention Bonus Plan. \nAs we pursue our plan to sell our properties opportunistically, including certain enhancement efforts, we believe that a main focus of management is to effectively manage our net assets through cash flow management of our tenant leases, maintaining or improving occupancy, and enhance the value of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties via the pursuit of the associated change in zone/entitlements.\nUnder the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement (the \"Settlement\") relating to the class action litigation against the Company, Gyrodyne agreed that any sales of its properties would be effected only in arm's-length transactions at prices at or above their December 2014 appraised values. The 2014 appraised value for the properties in the aggregate was approximately $100,000 higher than the 2013 aggregate appraised value for such properties used to value the interests of GSD, then a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation into which all of the Corporation's properties were transferred, and whose shares were distributed to the Corporation's shareholders. As of December 31, 2017, the appraised value in the aggregate of the remaining unsold properties was $4,416,665 higher than the 2014 appraised values. See, Risk Factors -- Stipulation of Settlement prohibits us from selling our remaining properties at prices below the December 2014 appraised values\u201d.\nWe generally finance our operations and acquisitions through cash on hand. However, we entered into a credit facility on March 21, 2018 that will provide up to $3.0 million in financing for tenant improvements pursuant to certain leases with Stony Brook University. The balance of the loan can only be drawn upon to finance tenant improvements if required in the event, the Company signs additional leases or lease expansions with Stony Brook University or its affiliates (or other improvements subject to the bank's approval) anytime during the Interest-Only Phase. We believe leveraging our tenant improvements will allow us to continue focusing our cash on funding the pursuit of entitlements and our operations. The Company believes the combination of the investments in tenant improvements related to strategically important leases and the pursuit of entitlements will enable the Company to maximize the ultimate real estate value and the distributions per share.\nThe Company is pursuing entitlements/zoning to maximize the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $1.7 million of land entitlement/re-zoning costs, of which approximately $353,000 was for the purchase, inclusive of closing costs, of a residential 0.3-acre lot adjacent to the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center. The balance was mainly attributable to preparing the respective applications for entitlements inclusive of certain costs related to addressing SEQRA. The preparation of the application is the first statutory step with each respective town, of our strategic plan to maximize the value to our shareholders with a low amount of risk. Although there can be no assurances, we anticipate that the acquired land will enhance the achievable density and sale value of the Cortlandt property. We estimate that the Company may incur approximately $2.5 million in additional land entitlement/re-zoning costs through 2019 in pursuit of special permits and or zone changes (approximately $0.6 million in Cortlandt Manor and $1.9 in Flowerfield).\nThe cash balance at the end of the liquidation period (currently estimated to be December 31, 2019, although the estimated completion of the liquidation period may change), excluding any interim distributions, is estimated based on the December 31, 2017 cash balance of $5.3 million plus adjustments for the following items which are estimated through December 31, 2019:\nCautionary Statements Concerning Forward-Looking Statements. The statements made in this Form 10-K, other materials the Company has filed or may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in each case that are not historical facts, contain forward-looking information\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended, which can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may,\u201d will,\u201d anticipates,\u201d expects,\u201d projects,\u201d estimates,\u201d believes,\u201d seeks,\u201d could,\u201d should,\u201d or continue,\u201d the negative thereof, and other variations or comparable terminology as well as statements regarding the evaluation of strategic alternatives and liquidation contingencies. These forward-looking statements are based on the current plans and expectations of management and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to our efforts to enhance the values of our remaining major properties and seek the orderly, opportunistic sale and liquidation of such properties as soon as reasonably practicable, the effect of economic and business conditions, risks inherent in the real estate markets of Suffolk and Westchester Counties in New York, the ability to obtain additional capital in order to enhance the value of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties, risks and uncertainties associated with any litigation that may develop in connection with our efforts to sell our properties opportunistically, including related enhancement efforts, and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports. These and other matters the Company discusses in this Report, or in the documents it incorporates by reference into this Report, may cause actual results to differ from those the Company describes. The Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company closed on the sale of three and five buildings (approximately 4,000 square feet each), respectively, in the Port Jefferson Professional Park as follows:\nOur tenants are subject to extensive federal, state, and local licensure laws, regulations and industry standards governing business operations, the physical plant and structure, patient rights and privacy and security of health information. Our tenants' failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of licensure, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines or other penalties, suspension or exclusion from the government sponsored Medicare and Medicaid programs, loss of accreditation or certification, or closure of the facility. In addition, efforts by third-party payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private insurance carriers, including health maintenance organizations and other health plans, impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon healthcare provider operations (through changes in reimbursement rates and methodologies, discounted fee structures, the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk or otherwise). Our tenants may also face significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees, all of which could impact their ability to pay rent or other obligations to us.\nThe Company's primary non-operating cashflows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are as follows:\nOur operating focus is on maximizing cashflows and market value of our operating properties while we are securing entitlements and zoning modifications with the objective of enhancing the value of our remaining major properties and maximizing liquidating distributions to our shareholders as soon as reasonably practicable. As of December 31, 2017, our properties were 69% leased to 42 tenants. As of December 31, 2016, on a pro forma basis to exclude assets sold through December 31, 2017, our properties were 77% leased to 48 tenants. The year over year decrease in the gross portfolio occupancy percentage is primarily the result of tenants terminated at Flowerfield to reposition the industrial park with an expanded leasing relationship with Stony Brook University. The expanded relationship is synergistic with the potential value associated with the entitlements being pursued on the undeveloped land. The Company believes the two-pronged strategy of pursuing entitlements while expanding the relationship with Stony Brook University will support our strategic goal of maximizing the estimated liquidating distributions via maximizing the real estate value of our remaining portfolio. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the Company has almost doubled the space we are leasing relationship to Stony Brook University which is a contributing factor to the increase in value of the real estate reported in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets.\n\nOur primary sources of non-operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the following:\nLot 2 owned by a catering facility that sits on a 12-acre lot that was sold in 2002. The subdivision was deferred by the town until the overall plan for Flowerfield was submitted.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve increased its benchmark interest rate multiple times in 2017. Furthermore, following the March 2018 Federal Reserve Meeting, the Federal Reserve announced another quarter point raise in the benchmark federal funds rate to a range between 1.5% and 1.75% and has continued signaling that rates could continue to rise. Increases in interest rates could decrease the amount potential purchasers are willing to pay for our properties. Expectations are for the rate increases to continue in the wake of ongoing economic growth and some acceleration in inflationary pressures, with the goal of the Federal Reserve to normalize the level of interest rates. Little in the U.S. macroeconomic data suggests that the economy is growing too rapidly, the primary symptom of trouble ahead for a business cycle. However, recent changes to tax policy, government spending and trade policy has created economic uncertainty as to whether these factors, in culmination, could adversely effect the current economic cycle. The uncertainty about continued economic recovery has also impacted, and may continue to impact, our tenants' businesses. For example, tenants may be reluctant to make long-term lease commitments. In the current economic climate, we continue to follow a disciplined approach to managing our operations. In certain cases, the Company has addressed these challenges through various tenant incentives which resulted in the Company's current market rents and related occupancy rates.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\nTo finance the buildout of the additional space, the Company secured a non-revolving credit line with a bank for up to $3,000,000, which closed on March 21, 2018. There will be an interest only phase for the first eight months of the loan ( Interest-Only Phase\u201d) after which it will automatically convert to a permanent loan maturing on November 30, 2025 (84 months after conversion to a permanent loan) (the Permanent Phase\u201d). The interest rate during the Interest-Only Phase shall be a variable rate equal to the daily highest prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal plus 100 basis points (1% rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent). During the Permanent Phase, the Company will pay interest at a fixed rate based on the Federal Home Loan Bank rate for a 7 year maturity as made available by the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York plus a margin of 200 basis points (2%) rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent but in no event less than 4.25%, plus principal based on a 20-year amortization period.\nFactors Which May Influence Future Operations\nIn addition to common area within Lot 8, the plan envisions an open space network of trails, benches and passive recreation that will serve as a recreational amenity to tie together the uses within the overall Flowerfield campus landscape. The entitlement costs from December 2013 through December 31, 2017 associated with the ownership and development of this property consisted of architectural and engineering costs, legal expenses, economic analysis, soil management and surveys totaling $1,923.740. The Company has an additional 5.2 acres bordering the industrial park that are currently zoned residential and are not part of the subdivision application.\nThe Company's subdivision application is expected to include proposed uses for the subdivided lots, although the specific uses will be determined by the eventual purchasers. It is anticipated that the proposed uses described herein would be typical of those chosen by the future owners and as a result we requested that the subdivision be considered with those uses so that the purchasers of the lots would have an assigned density. Furthermore, while we are pursuing the above entitlements, we are also seeking the approval of yield that can be transferred between the proposed uses as market demand changes. The Company's subdivision application includes perfecting the subdivision of the catering facility (12 acres hereafter referred to as lot 2) which the Company sold in 2002.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $5.3 million. The Company anticipates that its current cash and cash equivalent balance will be adequate to fund its liquidation process and dissolution over the next twelve months. The $5.3 million of cash will be partially used to fund our efforts to generate the highest values for the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties while simultaneously pursuing the opportunistic sale of these properties. The pursuit to generate the highest values of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor may involve the acquisition of properties, pursuit of joint venture relationships, entitlements and/or zoning changes and other investments and or other strategies to maximize the returns for our shareholders. The Company is estimating and reporting in the Statement of Net Assets total gross cash proceeds from the sale of its assets of approximately $33.0 million. Based on the Company's current cash balance and the above forecast, the Company estimates distributable cash stemming from the liquidation of the Company of approximately $26.6 million.\nWhile we cannot predict the outcome of the subdivision application, we have undertaken to subdivide the Flowerfield property in a manner that is economically advantageous to the Company.\nManagement Estimates - In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d) and the liquidation basis of accounting, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, including net assets in liquidation, and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of receipts and expenditures for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe anticipate the Town of Cortlandt Manor Planning Department to host a public hearing (community outreach meeting) in June, 2018, at which the Company will present its development plan for the Cortlandt Manor property, and after which the Town Planning Board will formally issue a positive or negative ruling under SEQRA. The Company does not plan on developing the property but rather positioning the properties to be sold with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction value for the Company in the shortest period of time with the least amount of risk to the Company.\nLots 6 and 7 are envisioned as assisted living communities, comprising a total of 220 units, again either as two separate lots or one combined lot. There would be a synergy with the SBU Hospital and with the medical office uses for medical care of the residents of the assisted living facilities.\nOn May 26, 2016, the Company declared a non-recurring special cash distribution on the Company's common shares of limited liability interests of $9.25 per share, or $13,714,790 in the aggregate payable June 15, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 6, 2016. Nasdaq set the ex-dividend date as June 16, 2016.\nAcquisitions:\nOur primary sources of non-operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of the following:\nThe net assets in liquidation at December 31, 2017 ($26,637,350) results in estimated liquidating distributions of approximately $17.97 per common share (based on 1,482,680 shares outstanding), based on estimates and other indications of sales value but excluding any actual additional sales proceeds that may result directly or indirectly from our land entitlement/re-zoning efforts. Neither the additional value that may be derived from the land entitlement/re-zoning costs, nor the retention bonuses for the sale of the Flowerfield property are included in the estimated liquidating distributions as of December 31, 2017. The Company believes the land entitlement/re-zoning costs will enhance estimated distributions per share through the improved values from the sales of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties. This estimate of liquidating distributions includes projections of costs and expenses to be incurred during the period required to complete the plan of liquidation. There is inherent uncertainty with these projections, and they could change materially based on the timing of the sales, improved values of the Cortlandt Manor and/or Flowerfield properties resulting from the land entitlement/re-zoning efforts net of any bonuses if such values exceed the minimum values required to pay bonuses under the retention bonus plan, favorable or unfavorable changes in the land entitlement/re-zoning costs, the performance of the underlying assets, the market for commercial real estate properties generally and any changes in the underlying assumptions of the projected cash flows.\nThe Company's assumptions and estimates (including the sales proceeds of all its real estate holdings, selling costs, retention bonus payments, rental revenues, rental expenses, capital expenditures, land entitlement/re-zoning costs, general and administrative fees, director and officer liability and reimbursement, post liquidation insurance tail coverage policy and final liquidation costs) are based on completing the liquidation by the end of 2019. As previously stated, on an ongoing basis, Gyrodyne evaluates the estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the reported net assets in liquidation and will update accordingly for any costs and value associated with a change in the duration of the liquidation, as we cannot give any assurance on the timing of the ultimate sale of all the Company's properties.\n 2. Proceeds from the sale of all the Company's real estate holdings. \n (ii) The Company estimates the cash outflows from rental operations net of commissions and rental costs, inclusive of expenditures to preserve or improve the properties at its current estimated market value and rental income, will total $(0.07). \nBasis of Presentation - Liquidation Basis of Accounting - Under the liquidation basis of accounting the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of operations, statement of equity, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the consolidated statement of cash flows are no longer presented. The consolidated statement of net assets in liquidation and the consolidated statement of changes in net assets are the principal financial statements presented under the liquidation basis of accounting.\nProperty Value Enhancement\nOur tenants in our Cortlandt Manor and Port Jefferson properties are healthcare service providers. Furthermore, the Company is repositioning the industrial buildings, in the Flowerfield Industrial Park, to expand and support Stony Brook University and Stony Brook University Hospital. The healthcare industry is subject to substantial regulation and faces increased regulation particularly relating to fraud, waste and abuse, cost control and healthcare management. The healthcare industry may experience a significant expansion of applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations, previously enacted or future healthcare reform, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or changes in enforcement priorities, all of which could materially impact the business and operations of our tenants and therefore the marketability of our medical office properties.\n \u25cf $2,590,645 in net proceeds from the sale of 3 of our buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park \nThe Company is making tenant improvements at Flowerfield to convert certain existing industrial space into office space to meet our expanding relationship with Stony Brook University, which the Company believes will enhance the value of the property as a whole by improving the building space and drawing a high quality long-term tenant. It would also increase the synergy with the University and allow for a portion of the trip generation from this office space to be accommodated using the internal access point between the properties. The Company believes that the planned tenant improvements for leases signed in the first quarter of 2018 will cost approximately $1 million and that we are financing the cost of such tenant improvements with a credit facility, rather than using our cash on hand. To finance the tenant improvements, we secured a non-revolving credit line with a bank for up to $3 million, with the first advance of up to $1.1 million to be used to finance the foregoing tenant improvements with Stony Brook Hospital. The balance of the credit line would be available for improvements under a lease with Stony Brook University or its affiliates or other tenant spaces with bank approval. There can be no assurance that the Flowerfield property will increase in value as a result of the tenant improvements or that any resulting increase in value of the Flowerfield property will exceed the cost of our planned tenant improvements including the cost of the related financing.\nDuring 2017, the Company incurred approximately $34,000 in leasing fees and commissions in exchange for revenue commitments of approximately $555,000 with leases ranging from 2 years to 5 years. The leasing fees reflect a renewal cost rate of 6.1% of the related revenue commitments. The Company often renews leases without external brokers or other third-party costs which during 2017 resulted in an additional $937,000 in lease commitments. As a result, the total lease commitments signed during 2017 was approximately $1.5 million. The Company has approximately 27% of its annual leasing revenue up for renewal in 2017, which compares unfavorably to 24% of leases up for renewal in 2016. General economic conditions, coupled with rental markets in which we operate, will dictate how rental rates on new leases and renewals will compare, favorably or unfavorably, to those leases that were signed in 2017.\nUnder the liquidation basis of accounting, all the Company's assets have been stated at their estimated net realizable value, or liquidation value, (which represents the estimated amount of cash that Gyrodyne will collect on the disposal of assets as it carries out the plan of liquidation), which is based on current contracts, estimates and other indications of sales value (predicated on current values). All liabilities of the Company, including those estimated costs associated with implementing the plan of liquidation, have been stated at their estimated settlement amounts. These amounts are presented in the accompanying statements of net assets. These estimates are periodically reviewed and adjusted as appropriate. There can be no assurance that these estimated values will be realized. Such amounts should not be taken as an indication of the timing or amount of future distributions or our actual dissolution. The valuation of assets at their net realizable value and liabilities at their anticipated settlement amount represent estimates, based on present facts and circumstances, of the net realizable value of the assets and the costs associated with carrying out the plan of liquidation. The actual values and costs associated with carrying out the plan of liquidation may differ from amounts reflected in the accompanying financial statements because of the plan's inherent uncertainty. These differences may be material. In particular, the estimates of our costs will vary with the length of time necessary to complete the plan of liquidation, which is currently anticipated to be completed by the end of 2019. The Company is in the process of pursuing entitlements, density and/or rezoning, and our ability to obtain required permits and authorizations is subject to factors beyond our control, including environmental concerns of governmental entities and community groups. The process will involve extensive analysis internally at the government entity level, as well as between government entities such as town planning departments and Gyrodyne, and will continue up until such time as entitlement, rezoning and density decisions are made by the relevant government entities. We hope to secure favorable decisions on entitlements, rezoning and density so that we can then seek the sale of our remaining properties at higher prices (than those achievable under their current entitlements) and then proceed with the liquidation and dissolution of the Company. The Company expects the process of pursuing entitlements, rezoning and density could take up to two years with the ultimate timing to a certain extent managed by Gyrodyne but ultimately dependent and under the control of the applicable municipality's planning board or other governmental authority. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict with certainty the timing or aggregate amount which may ultimately be distributed to common shareholders and no assurance can be given that the distributions will equal or exceed the estimate presented in the accompanying Statement of Net Assets.\n \u25cf $426,658 of capital expenditures on the real estate portfolio excluding those costs incurred under the land entitlement/re-zoning effort. \nThe Company filed an application with the Town of Cortlandt Manor to develop the Cortlandt Manor property, on March 31, 2017, as follows:\nThe Company estimates the net realizable value of its real estate assets by using income and market valuation techniques. The Company may estimate net realizable values using market information such as broker opinions of value, appraisals, and recent sales data for similar assets or discounted cash flow models, which primarily rely on Level 3 inputs. The cash flow models include estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period. These cash flows may include contractual rental revenues, projected future rental revenues and expenses and forecasted tenant improvements and lease commissions based upon market conditions determined through discussion with local real estate professionals, experience the Company has with its other owned properties in such markets and expectations for growth. Capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these models are estimated by management based upon rates that management believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective properties based upon an analysis of factors such as property and tenant quality, geographical location and local supply and demand observations. To the extent the Company under estimates forecasted cash outflows (tenant improvements, lease commissions and operating costs) or over estimates forecasted cash inflows (rental revenue rates), the estimated net realizable value of its real estate assets could be overstated.\nThe continued economic challenges for small businesses, including the lack of available credit to many of our tenant classes who are small businesses and the uncertainty facing medical tenants brought about by the 2010 Federal health care reform legislation, recent changes impacting such legislation and the current legislative environment could adversely affect our operating results and accordingly the estimated cash proceeds from the liquidation process.\n \u25cf $452,517 of costs incurred in the pursuit of entitlements for Cortlandt Manor inclusive of the land purchase; \n 3. The net cash used to settle the working capital accounts. \n \u25cf $736,867 of costs incurred in the pursuit of entitlements for Cortlandt Manor inclusive of the land purchase; \nThe Company's existing 33,871 square foot Cortlandt Medical Center and its approximate twelve acres are located directly opposite New York Presbyterian's Hudson Valley Hospital Center and within the boundaries of the MOD. The Company has committed resources toward both market research and feasibility studies in support of achieving entitlements to maximize the value of the property. For approximately two years the Company along with its planner and engineers have been working closely with the Town to identify issues and solutions involved in creating the Plan and more specifically, the MOD.\nThe mortgage loan is secured by approximately 31.8 acres of the Flowerfield Industrial Park including the respective buildings and related leases. The only significant financial covenant associated with the loan is a debt service ratio on GSD Flowerfield, LLC of 1.35 to 1. The Company anticipates modifying the terms of the loan following the completion of its subdivision.\n (v) The gross real estate proceeds do not include any value impact that may result from the estimated land entitlement/re-zoning efforts. As a result, fair value as reported does not exceed the minimum value under the retention bonus plan (the appraisal of the real estate in late 2013 plus the estimated entitlement costs) on certain properties and accordingly the Company has not included any estimated bonuses on the sale of the Flowerfield property. However, if the Company concludes in future periodic filings that the value of the real estate to the extent actual net proceeds from the ultimate disposition of the properties exceed the value of the real estate reported in the Statement of Net Assets as of December 31, 2017, and such net proceeds exceeds the minimum value required to pay bonuses under the retention bonus plan (whether due to appreciation of the underlying real estate and/or a reduction in estimated land entitlement/re-zoning costs), then the Company will report the updated estimated real estate value and the estimated bonuses related to such value of the Flowerfield property in accordance with the provisions of the retention bonus plan. \nTax legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017, makes numerous changes to the tax rules. For example, the top federal income tax rate for individuals is reduced to 37%, there is a new deduction available for certain Qualified Business Income, that reduces the top effective tax rate applicable to ordinary dividends from REITs to 29.6% (through a 20% deduction for ordinary REIT dividends received) and various deductions are eliminated or limited. Most of the changes applicable to individuals are temporary. There are only minor changes to the REIT rules (other than the 20% deduction applicable to individuals for ordinary REIT dividends received). To date, the Internal Revenue Service has issued only limited guidance on the changes made by the new legislation. It is unclear at this time whether Congress will address these issues or when the Internal Revenue Service will issue additional administrative guidance on the changes made by the new legislation.\nLot 1 encompasses the existing uses of the current light industrial park being retained thereby keeping in place jobs from the local business community, locations for back office operations of SBU, and studios for a vibrant arts community that yields cultural benefits to Smithtown and the surrounding communities.\nPort Jefferson Professional Park.\nOn June 16, 2017, the Company declared another non-recurring special cash distribution on the Company's common shares of limited liability company interests of $1.00 per share, or $1,482,680 in the aggregate, payable July 7, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 27, 2017.\n 5. Costs for the pursuit of the entitlement/rezoning of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties, to maximize value \nInterest Rates:\n 4. The general and administrative expenses and or liabilities associated with operations and the liquidation of the Company including severance, director and officer liability inclusive of post liquidation tail policy coverage, and financial and legal fees to complete the liquidation. \nAs a property owner with eligible parcels in this proposed district, Gyrodyne submitted an Environmental Assessment Form to the Town of Cortlandt Planning Department in December 2017 to support its application to receive a MOD campus designation. Once designated, the parcels would be governed by the use, dimensional and other provisions of the MOD zoning regulations and MOD zoning would replace the existing zoning. While the MOD zoning has not been formally adopted, Gyrodyne is proposing medical office and residential use and has designed the site to function as part of a future \"hamlet center\u201d with mixed use, streetscape improvements, a hamlet green and public plaza, and significant open space around Orchard Lake.\n \u25cf credit facility earmarked for tenant improvements. \nPrinciples of consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Gyrodyne and all subsidiaries. All consolidated subsidiaries are wholly-owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n \u25cf $881,066 in principal repayments on the investment in mortgage backed securities. \nNew accounting pronouncements - Management has evaluated the impact of newly issued accounting pronouncements, whether effective or not as of December 31, 2017, and has concluded that they will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements since the Company reports on a liquidation basis.\nCash Flows:\nAs used herein, the terms we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or the Company\u201d refer to Gyrodyne LLC, the succeeding company of the merger of Gyrodyne Company of America, Inc. and Gyrodyne Special Distribution, LLC with and into the Company. We operate as a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate company (prior to the Merger, a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d)) focused on pursuing entitlements/re-zoning, owning, leasing and managing medical, commercial and industrial real estate. Our tenants include unrelated diversified entities with a recent emphasis on medical office parks and properties. Our properties are located in Suffolk and Westchester counties in New York, which are characterized by strong real estate markets.\nThe following is a summary of lease expirations and related revenues of leases in place at December 31, 2017. This table assumes that none of the tenants exercise renewal options or early termination rights, if any, at or prior to the scheduled expirations:\nThe Company is pursuing value associated with the highest and best use for Flowerfield and the Cortlandt Medical Center. The actual costs of achieving such values may differ materially from the assumptions and estimates utilized and accordingly, could have a significant impact on the value of net assets.\n (i) The Company estimates interest income will be offset by the settlement of its working capital accounts resulting in a balance of $(1.00). \n\nExcluding gross proceeds from the sale of assets, the Company's gross rents and tenant reimbursements net of rental expenses is less than the combined total annual general and administrative costs, capital expenditures and land entitlement/re-zoning costs creating a net use of cash on an annual basis through the liquidation process. The Company believes the cash and cash equivalents plus the proceeds from the sale of assets and funds available through its credit facility will exceed the costs to complete the liquidation of the Company. In addition, the Company has and will continue to review operating activities for possible cost reductions throughout the liquidation process.\nWe actively manage the renewal process in conjunction with a third-party asset management firm. Historically, this has resulted in a very low turnover rate with our tenants. As a result, the Company continues to actively manage lease termination dates and often approaches tenants up to one year in advance to gauge renewal interest and negotiate related leases. Where a termination is likely, the Company begins marketing the property prior to termination to timely identify the market rent for the specific space, expected vacancy period and market demanded tenant concessions and incentives. During 2017, the Company provided approximately $72,700 in incentives in the form of tenant improvements and lease concessions in the form of rent abatement of approximately $25,000. The aforementioned incentives resulted in total lease commitments of approximately $570,000.\nAs the Company executes on the sale of assets, it will no less than annually, review its capital needs and declare and distribute any excess cash, accordingly. Upon completion of these activities, if successful, Gyrodyne will distribute the remaining cash to its shareholders and then proceed to complete the dissolution of the Company, delist its shares from Nasdaq or other exchange platform and terminate its registration and reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as Amended (the Exchange Act\u201d). Gyrodyne is required to make adequate provisions to satisfy its known and unknown liabilities which could substantially delay or limit its ability to make future distributions to shareholders. The process of accounting for liabilities, including those that are currently unknown or whose amounts are uncertain may involve difficult valuation decisions which could adversely impact the amount or timing of any future distributions.\nFairfax Medical Center.\nIn March 2016, the Company acquired a four-acre undeveloped lot, in Cortlandt Manor, for $210,000, including related costs which the company believes is synergistic to maximizing the value on its property.\nHealthcare:\nOn April 20, 2017, the Company closed on the purchase of a 1,950-square foot single-family residential dwelling located on approximately 0.3 acres in Cortlandt Manor, New York. The purchase price, inclusive of closing costs, was approximately $353,000. The Company was able to take advantage of a distressed sale following foreclosure action by the lender. The property which adjoins the Cortlandt Medical Center and is across the street from New York Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital Center, is expected to become part of the Cortlandt Manor MOD. The property may provide additional vehicular access to the site from Buttonwood Drive and State Route 202 and additional parking which, although there can be no assurances, the Company believes will further increase the yield in a manner that is cost effective and should provide a significant return on investment to the shareholders.\nGyrodyne's strategy is to enhance the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor, by pursuing various zoning or entitlement opportunities, which the Gyrodyne Board believes will improve the chances of obtaining better values for such properties. The pursuit of the highest and best use of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor may involve the acquisition of properties, pursuit of joint venture relationships and other investments and or other strategies to maximize the returns for our shareholders. Gyrodyne intends to dissolve after it completes the disposition of all of its real property assets, applies the proceeds of such dispositions first to settle any debts and claims, pending or otherwise, against Gyrodyne, and then makes liquidating distributions to holders of Gyrodyne common shares. Therefore, the Company includes in its financial statements the Statement of Changes in Net Assets for the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, all of which is discussed below:\nFlowerfield Industrial Park Value Enhancement Strategy. The Company's primary strategy is to pursue the entitlements. In addition, the Company is also implementing a secondary but parallel strategy of maximizing the value of the Flowerfield Industrial Park's current buildings through targeting certain uses which the Company also believes will help maximize the achievable density from the entitlements it is pursuing on the undeveloped property.\nIn March 2017, the Company filed a pre-subdivision application with the Town of Smithtown (the Pre-application\u201d) for the Flowerfield property along with the previously sold (2002) catering hall facility for an eight-lot subdivision. In June 2017, the Company filed a subdivision application with the Town of Smithtown based on feedback provided by the Town of Smithtown staff in the Pre-application process. Because of the property's location within 500 feet of a municipal boundary and a state road, the Town of Smithtown referred the Company's subdivision application to the Suffolk County Planning Commission as required by the Suffolk County Administrative Code and the New York State General Municipal Law.\nLots 4 and 5 are envisioned as medical office, general office, or tech space (R&D) in support of SBU, its Hospital and Children's Hospital, and its Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology (CEWIT). The two lots could be developed separately or as one larger lot. Approximately 129,750 square feet of office space in two buildings (53,400 and 76,350 sf) would be provided.\n 7. Proceeds from the draw downs on the debt facility to fund tenant improvements and costs to repay such outstanding debt. \nFlowerfield. Following extensive market research and related feasibility studies, we identified the entitlements that we believe will maximize the value of Flowerfield in the shortest amount of time with the lowest amount of risk. The Company has been in discussions with the Town of Smithtown on the potential real estate development projects identified by the market research and feasibility studies, all of which currently fall within our as of right to build\u201d zoning. We are also exploring with the Town of Smithtown whether it would be amenable to certain entitlements, special permits, or other concessions that would allow for the identified development projects.\nSpecial Distributions:\nThe first advance of up to $1.1 million will be used to finance the tenant improvements pursuant to the expanded signed leasing relationship with SBU Hospital described above. The balance of the loan can be drawn upon for improvements to be completed by the Company, as landlord, pursuant to a lease with State University of New York or its affiliates (or other tenants subject to the bank's approval) anytime during the Interest-Only Phase.\nFuture distribution/dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board and will depend on our actual cash flow, proceeds generated from opportunistic sales of properties, our financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as the Board deems relevant. The actual cash flow available to make distributions will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the factors discussed under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report.\nOn August 29, 2016, the Company declared another non-recurring special cash distribution on the Company's common shares of limited liability interests of $1.50 per share, or $2,224,020 in the aggregate, payable September 15, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 9, 2016.\nThe Company has a 10.12% limited partnership interest in Callery-Judge Grove, L.P. (the Grove\u201d). The Grove previously owned a 3,700+ acre citrus grove (the Grove Property\u201d) located in Palm Beach County, Florida as its only asset, which is the subject of a plan for mixed-use development. On September 19, 2013, the Grove Property was sold in a foreclosure proceeding to Minto Florida Developments, LLC ( Minto\u201d) pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement which provided that the Grove had the right to receive certain payments on the sale of single family residential units constructed on the property or on the sale of the property itself. During 2016, Gyrodyne was informed by the Grove's managing partner that Minto transferred the property to an affiliate which triggered an appraisal process that resulted in the payment (in lieu of being required to make payments on the sale of individual units or the property itself) by Minto to the Grove of $1,968,750. The Grove's managing partner also informed Gyrodyne that the payment along with some of its existing cash would be utilized to repay certain debt obligations owed to certain limited partners in the amount of $2.7 million. In light of the foregoing, Gyrodyne believes that the Grove will most likely not receive any additional payments from Minto beyond the aforementioned $1,968,750. Inasmuch as the Grove's obligations to certain limited partners exceeded the payment it received from Minto, it is unlikely that Gyrodyne could expect to receive any final liquidating distribution from the Grove.\nNet assets in liquidation at December 31, 2017 would result in estimated liquidating distributions of approximately $17.97 per common share. This increase of $0.01 from the December 31, 2016 net assets in liquidation of $17.96 per common share, net of the $1.00 per share special distribution paid in July 2017, is the result of increased property valuations offset by the tenant improvements required for a lease expansion with an existing tenant in the industrial park.\nThe Company's strategy to maximize the value of the Flowerfield Industrial Park includes repositioning the industrial buildings to service Stony Brook University, inclusive of Stony Brook University Hospital, while also making it a cultural destination (arts, health and wellness center) for the community. The Company believes this strategy will enhance the value of the entitlements (via a lower traffic impact than its historical use) while also increasing the cashflow and market value of the industrial buildings.\nThe Company has been working closely with Town officials on entitlement complexity, environmental impact studies, traffic mitigation, effluent, financial impact and other variables to ensure the application synchronizes with the Town's vision on the MOD. Furthermore, while we are pursuing the above entitlements, we are also seeking the approval of yield that can be transferred among the three proposed uses as market demand changes.\nItem 7.
